The target food item is 'salade grecque' in the image. It is served on a medium-sized black plate alongside a piece of walnut bread which we exclude from the weighing. The salad contains visible cubes of feta cheese, diced cucumbers, diced tomatoes, and pieces of black olives. The ingredients appear fresh and lightly mixed without excessive dressing. The portion nearly fills the plate, with pieces spanning an estimated 18 cm diameter. The salad has visible depth due to the layering of cubed vegetables and cheese, roughly around 3-4 cm thick considering the volume. Feta cheese is dense but only a part of the salad by volume, vegetables are less dense but compact. Typical Greek salad portion in Switzerland is smaller than US portions, and this seems to be a moderate portion. Estimating volumes and densities for mixed salad, this would translate to an approximate weight of 180 to 220 grams. Given the visual fullness and quantity of cheese and vegetables, I estimate the weight of the salade grecque to be about 200 grams.",2.949299664628132,5.786129930547091,0.23923444976076555

The pasta type appears to be a mixture of two shapes: fusilli (spiral) and curly instant noodles. The pasta forms a visible layer covering most of a standard rectangular plate (approximately 20-25 cm long). The portion looks fairly thick, about 2-3 cm deep, as the pasta is piled slightly but not too much. Compared to the size of the plate and considering the Swiss portion context, this is a medium-sized serving of pasta. Cooked pasta is dense and compact, so the weight is higher than it looks for the volume. A rough estimate per visual volume is around 150 g for this portion, as the noodles occupy about half of the plate area with moderate depth.",4.542316038666404,8.911414157247275,0.4784688995215311

The potato salad consists of chopped boiled potatoes mixed with onion, herbs, and a light dressing. For visual scaling, the plate is a standard small lunch plate, approximately 23 cm diameter, and the potato salad portion covers about a third of the plate surface with a moderate thickness. The potatoes appear roughly 1-3 cm chunks, and the pile is thick enough to estimate density close to firm cooked potatoes with some dressing. Potato salad is dense, so it weighs more than it looks compared to loose leafy food. Given Swiss portion sizes, this looks like a medium serving. Typical medium Swiss potato salad portions range from about 150g to 220g. Considering the visible volume and density, I estimate the potato salad portion here to be approximately 190 grams.",6.05148944565003,11.872209740436926,0.7177033492822966

The target food is 'gratin de légumes', which is visibly on the bottom left portion of the plate. Step 1 (Visual Identification): The gratin de légumes consists of visible slices of cooked eggplant, bell pepper strips, and some melted cheese in a tomato-based sauce, all mixed together. It seems to cover approximately one-third of the plate, slightly piled but relatively thin in depth without excessive layering. Step 2 (Dimension Analysis): The plate is a standard medium-sized plate (about 24 cm diameter). The gratin section covers roughly a 9 cm by 9 cm area. The depth estimate, considering a gratin is somewhat dense but not thick, is around 1.5 to 2 cm. Step 3 (Density Considerations): Cooked vegetables with tomato sauce and melted cheese are moderately dense, so the estimated density is close to 0.9 to 1.1 g/cm3. Step 4 (Portion Size Calibration): Calculating volume as 9 cm x 9 cm x 2 cm = 162 cm3. Multiplying by average density (~1 g/cm3) gives around 160 grams. Considering some moisture loss and shrinkage typical for gratin vegetables and the moderate cheese presence, I set an internal range from 130 to 180 grams. Given portion size appears moderate, I estimate toward middle range about 150 grams. Step 5 (Cross-Validation): This matches expectations for a Swiss portion of gratin de légumes, not over-abundant but a full serving. Overall, my estimate for the weight of the gratin de légumes is 150 grams.",7.263044979285856,14.249119018176966,0.9569377990430622

The pizza slice has roasted vegetables such as eggplant, zucchini, carrots, and bell pepper, along with tomato sauce and melted cheese on a relatively thin crust. The slice is roughly one eighth of a small to medium pizza, typically about 20 cm long and 10 cm wide at the crust. The crust is moderately thick and the amount of cheese and vegetables is moderate but spread unevenly. Considering the density of cooked vegetables and cheese, plus the dough crust, a full small pizza would weigh approximately 500-600 grams. Therefore, this single slice should weigh between 60-75 grams. Given it has a moderate amount of toppings and some visible thick crust, I estimate the weight of this single pizza slice at about 70 grams.",8.459138883408958,16.59569465489316,1.1961722488038278

Considering the orecchiette pasta shape, the pieces are fairly dense and layered with tomato-based sauce, cheese, and possibly some vegetables. The gratin is piled with some depth, visible as roughly 2-3 cm thick, and appears compact, not loose. Cooked pasta gratins are heavy due to the moisture and cheese content. Based on typical Swiss portion sizes and the visible volume, a small to medium portion weight is expected. A small portion of gratin might be around 120g, while a larger portion could be 180-200g.

Based on the plate diameter being a standard small dinner plate (around 22 cm), the blé aux légumes portion is approximately 10 cm by 7 cm in visible area, with an estimated depth of about 2.5 cm considering the moisture and volume of cooked grains with vegetables. Cooked wheat berries have a density similar to cooked grains, reasonably dense and compact. Vegetables and sauce add some volume without much density. Estimating volume around 175 cm3 and considering a density close to 1 g/cm3 for cooked grains with vegetables, the portion likely weighs around 170-190 grams.

Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Cherry tomatoes generally measure about 2.5 to 3 cm in diameter. Using the plate as a reference, these tomatoes fit that expected size range. Step 3: Density Considerations - Tomatoes are dense with high water content but not heavy; an average cherry tomato weighs roughly between 15 and 20 grams. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Since all are relatively uniform in size and quantity, the total weight is approximated by multiplying count by average weight. Assuming an average weight per tomato of about 16 grams (mid-range for small Swiss portion cherry tomatoes), 27 tomatoes × 16 grams = 432 grams.

The slice's length spans about half the diameter of a standard dinner plate (approximately 23 cm), making the slice around 11-12 cm in length. The crust is thin and not heavily thickened, consistent with a lighter Italian-style pizza. The cheese and sauce coverage is moderate, indicating a balanced moistness without excess weight. Given the thinness of the crust and moderate toppings, a typical slice of this size and style in a Swiss portion context would weigh approximately 85 to 110 grams. Considering these factors and the visible size, my best estimate for the pizza slice weight is around 95 grams.",19.574447622805287,38.402437915212886,4.784688995215311

The target food item is 'pâtes aux légumes (aubergines et carottes)', which appears on the right side of the plate. Visually, the pasta mixed with vegetables occupies about a third of the plate. The pasta is cut into short pieces and mixed with visible small chunks of vegetables. The plate is of standard Swiss small dinner size (about 20 cm diameter). Comparing the pasta portion to the other items on the plate (tomato slices and slices of dry- cured meat), the volume of the pasta mixed with vegetables seems consistent with a medium portion. Considering the depth of the food piled roughly 2-3 cm, the pasta and vegetable mixture is dense and cooked. Dense cooked pasta with vegetables typically weighs more than expected due to water content and vegetable density. A medium Swiss portion of pasta with vegetables would range between 130 to 170 grams. Given the visible amount, I estimate the weight of the 'pâtes aux légumes (aubergines et carottes)' to be about 150 grams.",20.06702505425133,39.36880869583729,5.023923444976076

It occupies more than half of the bowl's volume and is layered above some white rice at the bottom. Step 2: Dimension analysis uses the bowl as a reference, which seems to be a standard small-medium kitchen bowl (~15 cm diameter, ~6-7 cm depth). The dahl de lentille appears to fill approximately 60-70% of the bowl's volume, roughly about 280-320 ml in volume, assuming the dahl is somewhat thick. Step 3: Density consideration notes that dahl de lentille, a cooked legume dish with vegetables, is relatively dense and moist with a density estimated near 1 g/ml. Step 4: Portion size calibration accounts for a medium Swiss portion, leading to an estimated range of 260-320 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation ensures no underestimation due to being mixed and somewhat thick. Therefore, a reasonable estimation weighing on the middle-to-upper middle of the range leads to about 290 grams for the dahl de lentille alone.",20.555287038863682,40.32671314922217,5.2631578947368425

The pasta with sauce appears dense and moist, indicating a somewhat heavier weight than dry pasta alone. Given the portion size on a standard Swiss plate (smaller portion standard), the total weight for these tortellini with sauce should be estimated at the middle range of typical portions. Considering 15 pieces averaging about 12 grams each, the total weight estimate is around 180 grams.

The noodles are partially covered by the other ingredients but visible around the edges and underneath. The noodles appear to be slender, flat rice noodles that are typical in Thai cuisine. Given the size of the bowl (medium-sized bowl), and the visible volume of noodles suggesting a layer of about 1.5 - 2 cm depth underneath the toppings, the rice noodles portion likely corresponds to a single serving. Noodles are dense but lightweight compared to meat and vegetables due to their structure. Visual volume alone suggests a medium Swiss portion size, smaller than US portions.

The pasta portion underneath is somewhat visible and occupies about half the depth of the container base. Standard Swiss portions for cooked pasta are generally smaller than US portions, with a typical single serving between 100 and 130 grams. The pasta is cooked and appears to be spaghetti or similar, likely weighing around 120 grams for the visible portion. The shrimp are larger in volume than the pasta but fewer in number—about 9-10 shrimp visible. Cooked peeled shrimp typically weigh about 8-10 grams each. Assuming an average of 9 shrimp at 9 grams each gives roughly 81 grams in shrimp. The creamy herb sauce adds volume but minimal weight likely below 30 grams and is part of the dish but not counted separately here as we're estimating the combined 'pâtes aux crevettes' dish. Therefore, combining pasta (120 g) and shrimp (81 g), and adding small margin for sauce, the total weight estimate for 'pâtes aux crevettes' is around 200 grams.

We see that the bowl is about a medium size, with the contents filling roughly half to two-thirds of the bowl. Given the creamy texture and the presence of mix-ins (oats and chia seeds), the mixture's density is moderate, slightly thicker than yogurt. Typical portion sizes of blanc battu used as a snack or breakfast in Switzerland are around 120 to 180 grams per serving. Assuming some of the volume is from oats and chia seeds, and the blanc battu is the base and majority volume, the blanc battu alone would be slightly less than the total content volume.

The depth and density are typical of a tiramisu dessert: creamy but dense due to mascarpone and soaked biscuit layers. Step 3: Density Considerations - Tiramisu is fairly dense (mascarpone cheese, whipped cream, soaked biscuits), combined with the slight volume of dense berries. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given Swiss portion sizes and visible amount, this is a medium portion of tiramisu dessert likely prepared individually. Known typical tiramisu individual portions range around 120-150 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - The berries and creamy layers appear well mixed and dense, so the weight likely corresponds closely to volume in ml due to water and fat content.

The target food item is 'mélange de légumes' visible on the plate as a cooked vegetable mix primarily consisting of diced zucchini and yellow bell pepper pieces. The portion is roughly a small pile located on the left side of the plate. The vegetables appear cooked, which means some moisture loss but retention of density. The pile is about 6 cm by 5 cm on the plate surface and roughly 2 cm thick given the layering. Given that cooked vegetables have moderate density, I estimate the volume to be roughly 60 cubic centimeters. Assuming vegetable density close to 0.8 g/cm3, this results in about 48 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes are modest and the pile looks small to medium, I place the weight around the middle of the range, close to 50 grams. This estimation excludes any container weight and is based solely on the visible vegetable mix portion on the plate.",27.923185046360224,54.78153972981289,9.569377990430622

The target food item is ratatouille, located on the right side of the plate. It is a mixture of cooked vegetables including zucchini, eggplant, and tomatoes. The vegetables appear diced into roughly 1-2 cm pieces. Visually, the ratatouille occupies a compact but modest volume on the plate, roughly the size of a medium scoop, about 8 cm by 6 cm in surface area with an estimated depth of about 2.5 cm, taking into account the typical stewed vegetable layering and some hidden depth that isn't obvious from the top view. Such cooked vegetables have fairly dense moisture content, so weight per volume is fairly substantial. Considering the Swiss portion context, which is typically smaller than US portions, I estimate the weight range to be approximately 110-140 grams. Choosing a medium portion size based on visual evidence (not overly heaping but a decent portion), an estimate near the middle of this range is appropriate. Therefore, I estimate the ratatouille to weigh approximately 125 grams.",28.26634937857565,55.45478207189896,9.808612440191387

The image shows a single sandwich au fromage made with a seeded baguette-style bread roll, approximately 20-22 cm in length, typical of smaller Swiss portions. The bread is dense with a thick crust and a soft interior. The sandwich contains about 4-5 slices of semi-hard cheese, visible with some overlapping, each roughly 1-2 mm thick, plus a few leaves of lettuce. The cheese is denser than bread and leafy greens, so the cheese slices alone likely weigh around 40-50 grams in total. The baguette, considering its size and density, is estimated to weigh between 120-140 grams. Lettuce adds negligible weight, about 5 grams. Summing these estimates and considering the portion as medium-sized, the total weight of the sandwich au fromage (focusing only on the cheese inside) is about 45 grams of cheese. Since the prompt asks specifically for the weight of 'sandwich au fromage' as a whole food item, standard practice is to include the whole sandwich without container but taking everything inside (bread and filling). Therefore, combined the sandwich weighs approximately 165 grams. This reflects a typical medium-sized Swiss cheese sandwich with seeded bread. The main visual cue is the substantial bread size and visible cheese quantity.",29.2589268100217,57.402085715999725,10.526315789473685

The pasta pieces are well cooked and densely packed, showing some layering and overlap, suggesting a moderate to substantial depth. Comparing the pasta to the brochettes of sausages on the same plate, which appear smaller and denser, the pasta portion looks like a medium serving common in Swiss context, smaller than typical US portions. Estimating volume based on plate size (standard dinner plate of about 25-27cm diameter), the pasta mound is around 10cm by 6cm in surface area and about 2-3cm deep on average. Cooked pasta with sauce generally has a density around 0.9-1.1 g/cm3 due to sauce moisture. Using a conservative approach balanced for sauce density and visual fullness, a medium portion in this size range weighs approximately 140-170 grams.

Each frozen French fry typically weighs about 5-7 grams given their size and density. Lengthwise, each fry appears around 7-9 cm, standard for typical frozen fries seen in Swiss portions. Considering the amount, the total volume looks like a medium portion for Swiss standards. Accounting for the loose pile and the uncooked state, I estimate a weight range of 200-250 grams for the fries. Since the portion is moderate and not overly packed, a middle value around 230 grams is reasonable for the visible amount of frozen fries in the container.",29.88626948115999,58.63284780156091,11.004784688995215

Comparing the rice to the other foods (ratatouille and soufflé au fromage) and considering the standard French/Swiss portion size, this looks like a medium portion. The plate diameter can be assumed to be around 22 cm (standard small plate), and the rice depth, based on volume, is about 2 cm on average. Given that cooked white rice density is about 130-140 g per 100 ml, I estimate the rice volume to be approximately 150-170 ml, corresponding to roughly 200-240 grams. Given the visual evidence here, I estimate the riz portion weighs about 220 grams, aligning well with Swiss moderate portions.",30.177525152890112,59.20425232170883,11.24401913875598

The target food is 'pâtes' (pasta) visible inside a small glass jar. Step 1: Identifying the pasta inside the jar alongside sauce, peppers, and grated parmesan. The pasta is spaghetti shaped and occupies roughly half to two-thirds of the jar's volume. Step 2: The jar is small, likely holding about 250 ml total volume. The pasta appears packed with some sauce and vegetables, making the volume occupied by pasta slightly less than the jar's volume. Step 3: Considering pasta density: cooked pasta is dense and compact, so volume corresponds fairly closely to weight. A typical cooked pasta density is roughly 150 g per cup (240 ml) solid weight. Since the pasta fills about 130-150 ml of the jar portion, the pasta weight should be around 80-90 grams. Step 4: Portion size: this looks like a small to medium portion given Swiss smaller serving sizes, so I choose the middle of the range. Step 5: Cross-validation: the presence of sauce and vegetables reduces pure pasta volume somewhat, but the pasta strands appear tightly coiled, compensating for that.

The ratatouille portion covers about one-quarter of a standard Swiss-sized plate and is layered moderately thick, showing good volume and density typical for cooked vegetables that retain moisture. The pieces are roughly 1-2 cm cubes with visible sauce, contributing to some additional weight. Considering cooked vegetables have moderate density and the portion size is medium, I estimate a weight range between 130 g to 180 g.

Taking the size of the plate as a reference (around 20 cm in diameter) and the thickness of the bread slices (roughly 2-3 cm thick), each slice appears to be a substantial piece of bread. Dense breads like this typically weigh about 40-50 grams per slice of this thickness and size. Since there are two slices, total bread weight is around 80-100 grams.

There are visible blueberries scattered throughout, but since the mixture is homogeneous and the request is only for the cereal portion, the entire mix can be considered together as the milk/yogurt soaked cereal. The volume of the mix in the bowl appears substantial, about a medium portion suitable for one person, with an estimated depth around 3-4 cm, width and length roughly 12 cm each. Considering the density of soaked cereal with yogurt is moderate and the presence of dense blueberries adds some weight, an appropriate medium portion weight estimate would range from approximately 180g to 230g.

The pieces vary in size, with some larger chunks around 5-6 cm in length and others smaller, possibly closer to 3-4 cm. The depth of the curry sauce suggests some chicken pieces may be partially submerged, indicating more volume than a flat surface suggests. Considering chicken's density (dense meat), and that the sauce adds weight but does not count as a separate food item, we focus only on the chicken pieces. Given Swiss portion sizes are generally smaller than US portions, this looks like a medium portion. A single medium chicken breast piece with sauce can weigh around 40-50 grams.

Considering the volume relative to the other items, the endive appears to cover about 1/5 of the plate's surface. In terms of depth, the chopped endive is thin but piled up, suggesting some volume hidden beneath the surface layer. Endive is a leafy vegetable with moderate density – more dense than lettuce but lighter than cooked vegetables.

Taking into account that some pieces are larger or clumped together and the depth of the bowl which indicates some of the mozzarella could be slightly buried beneath other ingredients, I estimate the total mozzarella weight to be around 50-60 grams. Given this is a Swiss portion, I will pick a moderate value of 55 grams for the mozzarella present.",37.43097751035705,73.43455190390765,19.138755980861244

Considering the thickness and typical density of raw cauliflower, each floret likely weighs approximately 20 to 30 grams. Cauliflower is relatively light and airy, so the weight per piece will be moderate. Multiplying by 7 florets gives a range of about 140 to 210 grams total. Given the portion size here appears moderate, I choose a weight in the middle of this range.

Step 2: Dimension-wise, each petit pain au chocolat appears about 6-7 cm in diameter and has a typical thickness of about 3-4 cm based on the puffiness of the dough and chocolate. The granite surface gives a rough scale reference indicating standard size for small French pastries. Step 3: These are dense pastries with chocolate filling, so they are relatively heavy compared to simple bread rolls. Typically, a Swiss-sized petit pain au chocolat weighs less than larger bakery standards, but still roughly 50-60 grams each. Step 4: Given these are slightly rounded and compact three pastries without any extra size indications, I estimate each at about 55 grams. For three units, this totals approximately 165 grams.

Considering their cooked state, they retain some moisture but are still relatively light. Comparing their size to the plate (standard small Swiss dinner plate about 22 cm diameter) and the curry rice portion, the beans occupy about one quarter of the plate's visible area and have moderate thickness, giving a volume estimation of about 120-150 ml. Given the density of cooked green beans (around 0.6-0.7 g/ml), the total weight is likely between 75 and 105 grams.

Considering there are about 6 whole tomatoes or the equivalent if counting halves, this gives a base total around 60 grams. The tomatoes are cut and mixed with other ingredients and are partially obscured by pasta and leaves, so some hidden tomatoes likely add to the volume. Accounting conservatively for some hidden tomatoes and cutting reducing weight slightly but included juice remaining, an additional 10-15 grams is added. Therefore, the total weight estimate is in the range of 65 to 75 grams.

The sauce is not separately visible as a large volume but is integrated with the mushrooms, suggesting a thin layer. Considering that mushroom sauce is typically dense and creamy, and assuming the visible portion on the plate is the total portion served, the sauce including the visible mushroom pieces likely weighs about 50-70 grams.

For Step 1, the pasta pieces can be counted roughly, about 10-12 pieces visible, plus some scattered vegetables. Step 2, using the plate as a size reference, the pasta pieces are typical penne size, about 4 cm long each, and appear to be cooked, thus denser and heavier than dry pasta. The total volume of the pile is quite small, roughly equivalent to a few tablespoons or about a quarter cup. Step 3, considering density, cooked pasta is dense and compact, meaning weight is significant for its visual size. Corn and tomato add little extra weight but must be considered. Step 4, for portion size calibration, this is a very small leftover portion, much less than a standard side portion of pasta salad which would be around 150-180 g. Given the amount visible, the estimation falls into a small portion range of approximately 50-70 grams.

Comparing the chicken strips to the standard width and height of the rectangular glass container, which is likely around 15 cm in length and about 6-7 cm in width, each chicken strip seems to be approximately 12 cm long, 3 cm wide, and about 1.5-2 cm thick including sauce. This gives a moderate volume. The sauce adds some slight volume but is mostly on the surface and does not greatly increase weight beyond the chicken itself. Considering density, cooked chicken breast without bone usually weighs around 1.05 g/cm3. Given the relatively dense composition and compact shape, I approximate each strip’s weight around 70-90 grams with sauce. Two strips hence fall in the range of approximately 140-180 grams. Given the portion looks like a standard medium, not overly large nor very small, a midrange estimate is appropriate.

The image shows a metal bowl containing a mixture of yaourt nature (natural yogurt) and muesli nature. The target food item to estimate is 'yaourt nature.' Visually, the yogurt is partially covered by the muesli but is visible as a creamy white portion mainly on the right side of the bowl and a small scoop towards the bottom center. The bowl is medium-sized, with the yogurt layer appearing to be about 2 to 3 cm deep underneath the muesli. The muesli covers a substantial surface area, and the yogurt underneath looks to be a moderate portion. Given the visible amount and the standard density of natural yogurt (approximately 1.03 g/ml), and considering Swiss portions tend to be smaller than US portions, the yogurt amount appears to be around 100-120 grams. Choosing a conservative middle estimate within that range due to some coverage by muesli and the bowl size, I estimate the weight of the yaourt nature to be approximately 110 grams.",40.462961136318775,79.3828966643638,24.16267942583732

The target food item is 'haricots coco,' visible on the left side of the white plate as multiple flat, cut segments of greenish beans. I count approximately 15 pieces of haricots coco, varying slightly in size but generally around 5-7 cm in length and about 2-3 cm wide. The pieces are thick and dense, arranged in a single layer without significant stacking, so depth is roughly 2 cm. Considering the density of cooked haricots coco, which is moderately dense similar to cooked green beans, I estimate about 10-12 grams per piece on average due to thickness and water content. Multiplying 15 pieces by an average of 11 grams yields approximately 165 grams. Given that the portion looks moderate and not piled high, I adjust down slightly for some variation and moisture content than a US portion. Therefore, the final estimated weight of the haricots coco is 150 grams.",40.58746794239492,79.62716229997694,24.401913875598087

The image shows a single whole nectarine placed directly on a granite countertop, which provides a rough size reference. The nectarine is round and appears typical in size for Swiss portions, which tend to be smaller than US ones. By comparison to the granite surface texture and common dimensions of nectarines, its diameter is approximately 6-7 cm. Considering the density of stone fruits like nectarines, which include their skin and juicy flesh, a nectarine of this size typically weighs between 130 and 160 grams. No pieces are missing or hidden, and there are no layers or mixing involved, so the weight estimation is straightforward. Given a medium-sized nectarine and standard density, I estimate the weight to be about 150 grams.",40.71076642335764,79.86905736396302,24.641148325358852
