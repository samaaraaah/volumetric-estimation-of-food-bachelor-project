The image shows a carton containing cherry tomatoes ('tomates cerises') still attached to the vine. There are approximately 19 cherry tomatoes visible. Each cherry tomato appears to be of typical size, around 2.5-3 cm in diameter. Given that an average cherry tomato weighs roughly 15 grams, and confirming this with visual comparison to the carton and book which provide scale, these tomatoes look like a small to medium Swiss portion. Considering some tomatoes are slightly smaller and including the density and water-content of fresh tomatoes, a reasonable average per tomato is about 14 grams. Multiplying 19 tomatoes by 14 grams gives approximately 266 grams. Adjusting slightly for possible moisture loss under sunlight and the fact that some tomatoes may be smaller leads to an estimate near the middle to lower end of that range. Therefore, the estimated total weight of the tomates cerises in the carton is approximately 260 grams.",1.0409979700539584,2.045574513750746,0.07326007326007326

The image shows a cardboard container filled with clusters of cherry tomatoes still attached to their vines. First, I count approximately 18 individual cherry tomatoes visible. Each cherry tomato is roughly spherical and of typical size, about 2.5 to 3 cm in diameter, which is standard for Swiss cherry tomatoes, usually a bit smaller than US sizes. Considering that an average cherry tomato weighs about 15 grams, and since these look fresh and dense (standard water content), I multiply 18 tomatoes by 15 grams each to get around 270 grams. The container is shallow and does not appear to hold additional hidden tomatoes underneath, so no added weight for hidden volume is needed. The density of tomatoes means they are quite heavy for their volume, so 15 grams per tomato is a good estimate rather than under or overestimating. The portion seems medium to large for a single package, so I keep at the mid to upper range estimation. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the cherry tomatoes to be approximately 270 grams.",2.038621024689002,4.005916756095211,0.14652014652014653

The pieces are moderately sized and coarsely chopped, filling most of a standard small dessert bowl. The depth is moderate, around 3-4 cm, considering the salad is piled but not densely packed. Tomatoes, cucumbers, and olives have medium density, while feta cheese is denser. Given the Swiss portion context, this salad looks like a medium serving. Estimating volume roughly to about 250-300 ml of mixed ingredients, accounting for gaps between pieces, and average density of mixed salad around 0.8 g/ml, the rough weight is between 200 and 240 grams.

The crust is thin and slightly charred, indicating a Neapolitan or thin-crust style. The toppings include sliced mushrooms, melted mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, and several slices of ham or prosciutto scattered over the pizza. The cheese layer is moderately thick and melted, and the ham pieces are thin, somewhat folded, covering much of the surface but not overly dense. Given the typical densities: thin crust pizza dough weighs about 120-140 g for this size, tomato sauce around 50-70 g, cheese approximately 100-130 g, mushrooms around 50 g, and ham around 50-70 g depending on thickness and quantity. Adding these, the pizza's total weight is likely in the range of 370-460 g.

The potato salad pieces are relatively chunky and mixed with onions and herbs, making the overall volume more compact and dense. Comparing with the lettuce leaves next to it, which are light and less dense, the potato salad has a visibly more substantial volume. Considering the density of cooked potatoes and the dressing that holds the salad together, I estimate the depth to be about 2.5-3 cm. Given the Swiss portion context, which tends to be moderate, and typical portion sizes for potato salad, the reasonable weight range is approximately 150 to 200 grams. I place this serving towards the medium end of that range because it doesn't fully cover the plate but is a thick, dense serving.

There are approximately 12 tomato wedges visible, and some may be slightly overlapped or partially hidden. Considering typical density, fresh tomatoes weigh approximately 0.9 g/cm³ and given their size and volume, each wedge likely weighs around 20-25 grams. Counting 12 wedges, that gives a rough total of 240 to 300 grams of tomatoes. The flax seeds (graines de lin) sprinkled on top are very light and in small quantity, so their weight contribution to the salad is negligible and thus excluded. There is also some balsamic vinegar present, but since the task is to estimate only the tomatoes, this is not included in weight.

The dessert has a biscuit base soaked with red fruit juices, a middle layer with mixed red berries (fruits rouges) like raspberries and blackcurrants embedded in a creamy mixture of séré and mascarpone. The slice is roughly rectangular, approximately 8cm by 7cm based on plate size and raspberry size. The depth/thickness of the piece is around 3cm judging by the height of the creamy layer and base biscuit seen on the edges. The biscuit layer is dense but thin (about 0.5cm), the red fruit layer is mixed within the cream and berries are light but dense. The creamy mascarpone/séré mixture is quite light but dense and adds volume. Considering the total volume (~8*7*3=168 cm³) and the mixed density of creamy cheese and fruit, a density factor around 0.9 g/cm³ seems appropriate (slightly less than water because of air in cream). This gives an approximate weight of ~150 grams. Given the slice’s moderate size and typical portion sizes in Swiss desserts, a weight between 140-160 grams is expected.

The image shows a white ceramic dish containing flan aux asperges, garnished with four asparagus spears on top. The dish sits on a large white plate with a woven placemat as a background, providing scale. The flan surface is smooth and slightly puffed, suggesting a light custard texture. The dish is about the size of a small ramekin, approximately 12-14 cm in diameter and about 3-4 cm deep. Given the Swiss portion context, this is more of a single-serving size. The density of the flan, a custard with asparagus mixed in, would be medium—denser than a mousse but lighter than solid vegetables or meat. The asparagus spears on top are standard thickness but only cover the surface and add minimal extra weight as they are mostly decorative. Estimating the flan volume roughly as a cylinder of 13 cm diameter and 3.5 cm depth, the flan portion volume is approximately 465 cubic cm. Assuming a density similar to cooked vegetable custard, roughly 1.0 g/cm3, this results in about 460-470 grams. Accounting for the lightness of the mixture and space not fully filled (edges appear thin), a slightly lower estimate fits better. The asparagus decoration, about 4 small spears each weighing roughly 10 grams raw, likely soft-cooked and part of the custard or decoration, contributes about 30-35 grams. Since the question targets the flan aux asperges, the weight estimate should include the custard and embedded asparagus but exclude the dish weight. Hence, the total flan aux asperges is estimated at around 440 grams to be conservative and consistent with portion size. Therefore, the best estimate for this portion of flan aux asperges is 440 grams.",14.574882453979216,28.639833070209985,2.271062271062271

The plate seems to be of standard Swiss dinner plate size (~24 cm diameter). The pasta portion looks moderately thick, roughly 2.5-3 cm in depth, with the sauce coating the pasta but not overly watery. Pasta cooked with tomato sauce is dense and compact, so the weight is heavier than it might appear. Estimating the volume as roughly a flat mound about 15 cm wide by 15 cm deep by 2.5 cm high, that gives around 562.5 cm³. Considering the density of cooked pasta with sauce is approximately 0.9 g/cm³, the estimated weight would be around 500 grams.

The container is approximately the size of a standard lunch box compartment, with the polenta occupying about one-third of the container's length and about half its width. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes, the polenta's dimensions are roughly 7 cm by 5 cm by 3 cm thick, giving an estimated volume of about 105 cubic centimeters. Polenta is moderately dense, approximately 1.05 g/cm³. Multiplying volume by density results in an approximate weight of around 110 grams. The visible cheese atop might add some weight but is not part of the target food item. Given this, and acknowledging that the polenta is not densely compacted into a tight volume nor too loose, a medium portion estimate is appropriate.

There are approximately 15 visible gnocchi pieces spread along the bottom and sides of the container. The gnocchi are dense pasta-like food, so their density is relatively high compared to the cauliflower florets. Considering the size of the container (about the size of a small lunchbox roughly 15x15 cm), the gnocchi layer is about one piece thick without much stacking, so little hidden depth. Each gnocchi piece typically weighs between 12-18 grams depending on density and size, but here they look medium-sized and slightly compact. Multiplying the approximate average of 15 grams per piece by 15 pieces gives around 225 grams.

Visually, the pasta forms a moderate-sized portion, roughly a single serving size typical in Switzerland. Given the shape and volume, and considering cooked fresh pasta weighs more than dried, the pile looks to be around 150 to 180 grams. Since this is a moderate portion (not overly heaped, but covering most of the plate base with a visible thickness and some overlapping layers), I estimate around 165 grams.

The bananas appear to be blended into the smoothie base, visible as a creamy, pale brown substance under the strawberries and some peanut butter on the sides. Since the bananas are frozen and blended, their form is unrecognizable as separate pieces visually, so I must estimate based on bowl volume and typical portion densities. The bowl size is roughly medium, as compared to the hand holding it. The smoothie likely fills about 3/4 of the bowl. Assuming the base is mostly frozen bananas with some peanut butter mixed in, frozen bananas typically have a density around 0.6-0.7 g/cm3 once blended.

The piece looks about 8 cm wide and roughly 6 cm deep, with a height of approximately 2.5 cm when considering the biscuit and creamy layers combined. The berry count on top is three raspberries and two blueberries, with more fruits likely embedded within the layers judging by the red color on the biscuit, so the amount of fruit is moderate. Given the dense biscuit base, creamy mascarpone layer, and fresh fruit, the density is moderately high, but the piece is not very thick.

The target food item is ratatouille, which is located on the right side of the plate next to the two fried eggs and the rice. Visually, the ratatouille consists of cooked vegetables including zucchini, tomatoes, onions, and bell peppers, diced into medium-sized chunks. The portion covers roughly a quarter of a standard dinner plate and has a somewhat loose pile with visible volume and some juice, indicating moderate depth. Comparing the ratatouille's volume to the rice and eggs, and considering it is a cooked vegetable dish with moderate density, I estimate this to be a medium-sized portion. Typically, a medium portion of ratatouille served in Switzerland weighs around 150-180 grams. Given slight moisture content and the observed volume, I select a weight of approximately 160 grams for this dish of ratatouille.",24.04213439283794,47.243105928064786,5.86080586080586

The omelette slices have visible tomato pieces embedded in a light, cooked egg mixture. Each slice is approximately the size of half the bread slice and appears about 1.5-2 cm thick. Considering density, a cooked egg omelette is moderately dense but lighter than solid meat. Typical tomato pieces are incorporated but do not greatly add to weight. Given the size and thickness of both slices combined, this portion is medium-sized for Swiss portions. A typical egg omelette slice of this size weighs approximately 60-70 grams each. Therefore, the two slices together likely weigh between 120 and 140 grams.

The pasta appears to be penne, coated evenly with a yellow saffron-infused cream sauce. The portion covers roughly slightly less than half of a standard sized dinner plate. The penne pieces are layered mostly flat with some slight piling, and I estimate a depth similar to a single layer with some thickness added by the sauce. Comparing to the brochettes of sausages on the right (which typically weigh around 100-120 grams for three small sausages), the pasta portion appears slightly larger in volume but less dense than meat. Considering cooked penne pasta with a creamy sauce, density is moderate to high. A typical Swiss portion size of cooked pasta is around 120-150 grams, the sauce adding some weight but not excessively. Visually, the portion looks medium in size, not heaped nor minimal.

Considering the thickness and density of cooked lentils, which retain moisture and have a relatively high density, the volume corresponds to a moderate weight. The dish is homogeneous and dense, so the weight is not only on the surface but also volumetric. A full medium portion of dahl in such a bowl would be around 250-300 grams.

Considering the plate size and the neighboring items (two medium-sized chicken fillets and a serving of green beans with onions), the millet portion appears to be modest. Cooked millet is dense and compact, meaning the volume corresponds closely to the weight. Estimating the dimensions roughly as 7 cm wide, 5 cm deep, and about 2.5 cm in height (accounting for the loose grain texture and hidden depth), the volume is around 87.5 cubic centimeters. Given cooked millet usually weighs about 1 gram per cubic centimeter, and factoring in some air gaps between grains, I estimate the weight to be between 70 and 90 grams.

Each gnocchi piece is roughly 3-4 cm long and quite plump, indicating a typical homemade or fresh gnocchi shape. Visual comparison to the plate and egg portion suggests the gnocchi depth and density is moderate, as cooked potato gnocchi are dense but not heavy. Swiss portions tend to be smaller than US portions, so the total amount is moderate in size. Considering the density and the visible number of pieces, a reasonable portion size for 24 medium-sized gnocchis is approximately 160-190 grams.

Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The container seems to be a small-to-medium food storage box; pasta is piled to roughly a moderate height, maybe around 3-4 cm thickness. Shrimp are layered on top but not excessively piled. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cooked pasta is dense and compact, so a moderate volume accounts for a decent weight. Shrimp are dense seafood but lighter per piece than meat. The cream sauce adds moisture but is a minor volume compared to solids. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Swiss portions tend to be smaller than US portions. A portion of cooked pasta in this container could be around 120-150 grams, and the shrimp portion of 9 pieces is likely between 70-90 grams.

Step 1: Visual Identification - The vegetable mix is distinct and separate from the other items on the plate. It is not mixed with the chicken brochettes or the galette. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The vegetable portion occupies a modest area of the plate, approximately 6 cm by 5 cm in surface, with a depth around 1.5 to 2 cm, considering cooked vegetables tend to be soft and slightly compact but not piled high. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cooked vegetables retain density and moisture but are lighter than dense meat. Based on density, about 0.8 g/cm3 is reasonable for cooked zucchinis and bell peppers. Calculating approximate volume: 6 x 5 x 1.8 cm = 54 cm3. Applying density: 54 cm3 x 0.8 g/cm3 = roughly 43 grams. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given Swiss portion sizes and the visual modesty of the portion, this fits a small to medium serving.

Step 2: Comparing to the bowl size, likely a medium cereal bowl (~15 cm diameter), the beans have significant thickness and length around 10-12 cm each, with some overlap and folding increasing apparent volume. Step 3: Considering that broad beans are dense vegetables with moderate water content, the density is fairly high and they have some weight despite being cooked and softened. Step 4: For portion size, this appears a medium serving of cooked broad beans based on typical Swiss portion sizes, considering that cooked green beans are roughly 120-140 g per cup volume.

The jar is roughly the size of a standard small yogurt container, which typically holds between 100 to 150 grams of yogurt. Visually, the yogurt fills about half of the jar, with the blueberries occupying the top half. Given the jar size and the yogurt level, the yogurt portion looks like approximately 100 grams. Yogurt is dense but smooth, so the volume closely correlates with its weight. Considering Swiss portion sizes are smaller than US, this amount better aligns with a small to medium natural yogurt single-serving portion. Therefore, I estimate the natural yogurt to be around 100 grams.",26.688811006818533,52.443859804096064,7.326007326007326

Step 1: Visual Identification - the dahl de lentille appears as a thick, orange-colored lentil stew with visible pieces of carrot and onion mixed in the bowl. It occupies roughly half of the bowl's volume. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - the bowl is a medium sized bowl typically holding around 400-500 ml. The dahl portion visually fills about half the bowl, so around 200-250 ml volume. Step 3: Density Considerations - cooked lentils and vegetable stew have a dense but moist consistency, with an estimated density approximately 1.0 g/ml, meaning volume in ml roughly equals grams in weight. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - given that the portion is about half a medium bowl, the weight would be in the range of 200-250 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - the mixed lentils and vegetables make the dish denser than plain liquids but less dense than solids, so the weight estimation around 230 grams is reasonable.

The total volume of the food in the container looks to be approximately 400-450 ml, and couscous occupies about 60-70% of this volume, so roughly 250-300 ml volume of couscous. Step 4: Considering cooked couscous density around 0.9 g/ml, this translates to a weight range of around 225-270 grams. Given the visible ratio and Swiss smaller portion sizes, a medium portion estimate around 240 grams seems reasonable. Step 5: Cross-check with tuna and cucumber quantities confirms there is no obvious underestimation or overestimation of volume.

The depth of the bowl is moderate, and the yogurt is mixed thoroughly with other ingredients, but for weight estimation, I consider mostly the yogurt volume which looks like about 150-180 ml (around 150-180 grams, since yogurt density is close to water). Given that part of the volume is occupied by cereals and blueberries, the actual yogurt weight is somewhat less than the full volume. Visually, it appears around 100 grams of yogurt are present in the mixture. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes and the mixing ratio, I estimate the 'yogourt orange sanguine' to weigh approximately 100 grams.",28.85183996391206,56.69423976103876,8.717948717948717

The target food 'poulet au curry' is the yellowish portion on the left side of the plate. Visually, it consists of several small chicken chunks coated in curry sauce, spread in a roughly oval shape about half the size of the plate width. Given the plate is a standard small rectangular plate, the portion covers an estimated 8-10 cm in length, 5-6 cm width, and the visible depth appears about 1.5-2 cm, though some volume is hidden underneath. Chicken is dense, and curry sauce adds slight moisture weight. The portion looks like a single moderate serving of chicken curry typical in Swiss portions. Considering these visual clues and densities, I estimate the 'poulet au curry' weighs approximately between 100 to 120 grams. I select the middle-high value due to the visible sauce and chunk sizes, hence about 110 grams is a reasonable estimate.",28.952608567413282,56.89225137396983,8.791208791208792

The image shows a plate containing couscous complet, chou-fleur, poulet, and asperges. The couscous complet is located on the left side of the plate, appearing as a granular, slightly compact mound. Step 1: Visual Identification - The couscous complet occupies about a third of the plate area, visible entirely and not mixed with other ingredients. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The plate is a standard small dinner plate approximately 22 cm in diameter. The couscous pile seems approximately 8-9 cm wide, 7-8 cm deep, and is fairly flat but with some height, likely around 2.5 cm thick. This corresponds visually to a small to medium portion. Step 3: Density Consideration - Cooked whole wheat couscous is dense and granular. Based on typical density (~0.8 g/cm3 cooked), the volume approximates weight. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Calculating volume roughly: 8.5 cm × 7.5 cm × 2.5 cm = approximately 159 cm3. Multiplying by density 0.8 gives about 127 grams. Adjusting for some irregularities and visual spare spaces, the portion likely ranges between 110 and 140 grams. Given the portion looks medium-sized relative to Swiss standards, I estimate the couscous complet portion on the plate to be approximately 125 grams.",29.053186321286663,57.089887964906715,8.864468864468865

Visually, the risotto covers about half the plate's surface in a flattened mound approximately 1.5 to 2 cm thick. The plate is a standard dinner plate (~25cm diameter), so the risotto portion roughly occupies a circular area of about 12 cm in diameter. Risotto is a dense cooked rice dish, typically dense and moist, meaning a small volume weighs more than expected. Given the flattened shape and size, and comparing with the size of the salad leaves, this represents a medium portion typical of a Swiss meal. Estimating the volume as a 12 cm diameter circle × 1.7 cm thickness gives about 190 cm³. Cooked risotto density is close to 1.2 g/cm³ due to moisture and starch, so weight approximates 228 grams. Considering edges and irregularities that slightly reduce volume, and parmesan layered on top adds only minor weight, a final conservative estimate rounds to 220 grams for the risotto au safran.",29.15273175217307,57.28549602778413,8.937728937728938

Each piece looks dense and thick, approximately 3cm wide, 5cm long, and about 1.5cm thick. Given the ingredients (millet, black beans, corn), these galettes are relatively dense and moist, so weight per piece is not negligible. Estimating the density similar to a firm vegetable patty, I approximate each piece weighs between 35 and 45 grams. Multiplying by 6 pieces gives a range of 210 to 270 grams. Considering the size and visible density, I select the middle to upper end due to their thickness and compactness.

Multiplying 10 visible pieces by 20 grams gives about 200 grams. Accounting for some hidden pieces and density, a weight range of 180 to 220 grams is reasonable. Given this is a typical Swiss portion size, I estimate the cervelas weight at around 200 grams.",32.58203064004022,64.02411282325322,11.794871794871796

The image shows one single banana placed on a wooden surface. The banana is medium-sized, with a typical curved shape and standard thickness. Comparing it to the wooden planks, which are usually around 8-10 cm wide, the banana is about 15-18 cm in length. Swiss portions tend to be smaller than US ones, and considering that an average banana weighs between 100 and 135 grams, this banana appears to be on the smaller to medium side. The skin is intact and the banana looks fairly fresh without any visible bruises or dehydration. Its density is typical of fruit with skin, so the weight includes the whole portion visible. Based on visual inspection and common nutritional data for bananas, I estimate the weight at approximately 110 grams.",32.66075611152555,64.17880939585561,11.868131868131869

The ratatouille is located at the upper right section of the plate. It consists of visible chunks of vegetables including zucchini, eggplant, and tomatoes in a cooked, stewed form. The portion covers roughly one-quarter of the plate's visible surface area and is moderately heaped, suggesting it has some depth not fully visible but typical for stewed vegetables. Compared to the bulgur portion next to it, which is quite dense, the ratatouille appears less dense but still substantial due to the vegetable density and sauce. Given Swiss portion sizes tend to be moderate, and considering a modest depth (about 2-3 cm) of chunky cooked vegetables, a typical medium portion of ratatouille on a plate this size is approximately 130 to 170 grams. Visual cues here suggest it leans toward a middle-sized portion rather than very small or very large.

The sauce appears to be a cooked tomato sauce with a medium consistency spread generously over the pasta, which gives some volume. The metal container is relatively small, about the size of a typical lunchbox, so the food portion sizes are moderate, consistent with Swiss portion sizes. The sauce volume corresponds roughly to a layer about 0.5 cm thick, covering an area of approximately 10 cm by 6 cm (right side) and some spread under the omelette area to the left. Estimating the total sauce volume at around 40-50 cubic centimeters. Tomato sauce density is close to water, about 1 g/cm³, so the volume in cm³ equals weight in grams.

The bowl is of moderate size, similar to a typical salad bowl about 18 cm in diameter. The depth of the cucumber pieces appears to be the same as the visible height since they are chopped, roughly 2 cm depth. Cucumber is a low-density, watery vegetable, so it weighs less than denser vegetables of the same volume. Estimating the cucumber portion volume: about one quarter of a bowl of this size is roughly 200-250 ml volume, considering the uneven pile and space between pieces. Given cucumber's density (~0.96 g/cm3), weight should be about 190-240 grams. Observing the pieces, the quantity seems moderate, not heaped or overflowing; hence, a medium portion.

The portion covers roughly a quarter of the plate surface and appears to be a moderately thick layer, suggesting some depth but not very deep. The vegetables in ratatouille are cooked and dense, so the weight should be considered accordingly. Comparing the size relative to the plate and the nearby bulgur (which looks like a medium portion), the ratatouille portion is medium-sized but somewhat compact. Considering the volume and density of cooked vegetables, a reasonable weight estimate would be between 150-180 grams.

Considering typical Swiss portion sizes for porridge served in small containers, the porridge layer thickness is approximately 5-6 cm in height. Given the density of cooked oats, which is fairly compact and moist, the weight for this volume can be estimated. A common approximation is that 100 ml of cooked porridge weighs around 120 grams due to its moisture. The porridge roughly occupies about 180-200 ml in volume here. Therefore, the weight of the porridge is approximately 220-240 grams.

The pieces sit closely compacted, suggesting some depth and unseen volume beneath the pile. Using the plate diameter and fork in the background as references, the total area taken by all potato pieces is moderate but denser in mass compared to lighter vegetables. Potatoes are relatively dense, and the skin adds some weight. Each piece likely weighs about 15-20 grams based on size and density.

Brown rice is dense and compact when cooked, so its visual volume corresponds relatively well to weight. Comparing to the plate diameter (approx. 26 cm) and the salmon portion size, this rice portion is moderate but not large. Estimating volume at about 10 cm x 7 cm x 2.5 cm = 175 cm3. Cooked brown rice density is about 1.3 g/cm3, so estimated weight = 175 x 1.3 = approximately 228 grams.

The target food is 'thon' (tuna), which is visible on the plate as pink chunks distributed mainly beneath and mixed with the corn. Step 1: Visual Identification - The tuna pieces are clearly visible in medium-sized flakes, spread over the salad and under the corn, but covering most of one half of the plate. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The plate is a standard side plate, roughly 20-22 cm in diameter. The tuna covers an area approximately 10-12 cm in length and 6-8 cm in width, with medium depth since the tuna flakes are piled but not very thick. Estimated visible volume corresponds roughly to a small mound about 1.5-2 cm thick overall. Step 3: Density - Tuna in water or brine is dense and compact, so the chunks look smaller than the actual weight per volume. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Considering Swiss portion size context and the visible quantity, this appears to be a medium portion of canned tuna used in salads, typically between 80 to 120 grams. Step 5: Cross Validation - The tuna portion is substantial but not overly large to be considered excessive. Considering all the above, a reasonable estimate of the tuna weight is around 100 grams.",35.5339538837899,69.82468028607907,14.7985347985348

Visually, there are about two noticeable pieces of white meat (breast) and a smaller portion that looks like thigh with skin. The chicken pieces are somewhat thick, indicating a realistic depth and not just thin slices. Comparing the size of the chicken pieces to the plate dimension indicates a moderately sized portion. Given that a typical small portion of cooked chicken breast in Swiss context is about 90-120 grams, and considering the pieces include moist meat and some skin, I estimate the total chicken portion here as medium-sized, around 110 grams.

The image shows a half piece of a small round loaf of bread ('pain') placed on a wooden surface next to a chocolate stick for scale. The bread has a thick crust with a soft, airy interior. Comparing the size of the bread to the standard chocolate stick which seems about 10 cm long, the bread piece appears roughly 7-8 cm in diameter and about 3-4 cm thick. Given the density of typical artisanal Swiss bread, which is moderately dense but airy, a full small round loaf of this size (approx. 15 cm diameter) usually weighs around 300-400 grams. Since this is approximately half the loaf, and considering some pieces are missing from the bite taken, the visible portion likely weighs around 140-180 grams.

Step 2: Dimension Analysis includes comparing the pasta ribbons to the size of the plate (standard-sized dish) and the side spinach portion. The tagliatelles form a medium-sized serving covering roughly half the plate, with visible thickness typical of fresh or cooked tagliatelles. The pasta strands are about 5-7 mm wide and are loosely folded, giving an estimation of 1-1.5 cm depth on average. Step 3: Density Considerations note that cooked pasta is dense and compact, so the volume relates closely to its weight, roughly 140-160 g per medium portion of tagliatelles. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration suggests this is a moderate Swiss portion, not overly large. Taking this into account, a mid-range value around 150 grams is suitable. Step 5: Cross-validation avoids underestimating the dense pasta portion, affirming this estimate as neither too small nor excessive. Overall, the tagliatelles weight is estimated at approximately 150 grams based on the visible amount, density, and portion norms.",38.02401235317589,74.7176774765166,17.94871794871795

The pieces are roughly bite-sized, with an estimated thickness of around 2 cm and overall a moderate volume. Comparing to the size of the container, which is a standard single-serving meal tray, I estimate the depth of the curry-covered chicken to be around 2-3 cm. Chicken is dense meat, so each piece likely weighs about 30-40 grams. Multiplying by 6 pieces gives between 180-240 grams roughly. The curry sauce adds some weight but is excluded since the request specifies only the chicken itself.

The noodles are thin, white, flat strands characteristic of rice noodles. The portion is spread in a relatively thin layer beneath the pork and vegetables. Using the size of the bowl and comparing it to the portion of noodles visible, the noodles occupy about half to two-thirds of the bowl's surface area in a thin layer, likely about 1 to 1.5 cm thick. Given the Swiss context (smaller portions), and typical density of cooked rice noodles (heavy due to water absorption), the density is high—approximately 1 g/cm3. Considering a medium-sized bowl of about 20 cm diameter, the estimated noodle volume is roughly a 12 cm diameter circle, about 1.5 cm deep, which results in about 170 cm3 of rice noodles (π × (6 cm)^2 × 1.5 cm).

The wooden cutting board and the garlic clove provide scale references; the garlic clove is a typical small size around 5 grams. Considering raw pasta density, which is quite dense and compact, and adjusting for the Swiss portion context where portions are smaller, the portion in the image appears to be approximately one small serving size. Estimating by volume and density, the pasta weighs about 50 to 60 grams. I estimate the weight of the pâtes to be 55 grams.",38.90789770459944,76.45452365677949,19.194139194139193

Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The pile covers about one quarter to one third of the plate surface. Given a standard Swiss dinner plate of approximately 24 cm diameter, this corresponds to roughly 7-8 cm by 8-10 cm surface area for the potatoes, with an estimated average depth of about 1.5 to 2 cm due to the small pieces' thickness and layering. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cooked potatoes, being dense and starchy, weigh relatively more for their volume. Fried potatoes have some oil but are still dense. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - For Swiss portions, this looks like a medium portion of sautéed potatoes, likely between 120g to 180g. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The number of potato cubes visible is about 35 to 40 pieces; each likely weighs about 3 to 4 grams, which aligns with the volume estimation.

The portion of tortellini with sauce occupies about one-third of the plate’s surface area. Considering the Swiss portion context, the typical sauce to pasta ratio is about 1:2 by weight, meaning sauce weighs about half as much as pasta, or slightly less. For visual scale, the tortellini portion looks to be medium-sized, with about 10-12 tortellini pieces, each averaging approximately 15 grams with sauce included, totaling roughly 150-180 grams. Estimating the sauce alone by visual volume, it appears to be a moderate coating, roughly 40-50 grams. Tomato sauce is moderately dense but mostly water, so its volume distribution fits this weight.

I count around 45-50 individual spiral pasta pieces visible in the container. Each spiral is about 3-4 cm in diameter and approximately 1-1.5 cm thick. The pasta is dense once cooked, so volume increments correspond to significant weight. Considering the container size (~15x10x5 cm), and the pasta occupying roughly 60-70% of the total volume mixed with leafy spinach and other vegetables, the pasta portion is substantial but moderate for a Swiss portion. A reasonable average weight per piece of spiral pasta might be around 3.5 grams considering density and size. Multiplying 48 pieces by 3.5 grams gives about 168 grams.

The image shows one whole apple ('pomme') on a wooden table. The apple is roughly spherical and appears to be of a small size, more compact than a large typical apple. Comparing the apple size to the wooden table's groove width and texture pattern, which are standard, suggests this apple is smaller than average but not miniature. Typical medium apples weigh around 150-180g, while smaller apples weigh about 100-120g. Given the compact size and visual cues, the apple's weight seems closer to the lower-medium range rather than a large apple.

The target food item is 'riz' (rice), which is the pile of cooked rice mixed with small pieces of vegetables on the right side of the plate. Step 1: Identification—the rice portion appears as a moderately sized heap roughly covering an area of about 8 cm by 6 cm on the plate. Step 2: Dimension analysis—considering the cooked rice with vegetables, the depth is estimated around 1.5-2 cm, factoring in some compression and fluffiness of cooked rice. The plate and fork offer a reference scale, indicating this is a medium Swiss portion. Step 3: Density consideration—cooked rice is dense and compact, meaning the volume given translates to a heavier weight than lighter foods. Step 4: Portion size calibration—this portion looks medium, not overly full or sparse. Typical cooked rice density is approximately 130-140 g per 100 cm³. Using rough volume (8 cm x 6 cm x 1.75 cm = 84 cm³), the weight estimate falls around 110-120 g.
