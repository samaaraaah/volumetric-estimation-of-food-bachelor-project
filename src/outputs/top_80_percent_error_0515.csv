The specified food item is 'mélange de céréales,' which is visible in the bowl mixed with yogurt and blueberries. The cereal mix appears to include flakes and possibly granola or muesli, which are dense and compact. The bowl is filled to a medium level, and the cereal mix seems to make up a significant portion of the volume, though it is mixed with yogurt. Considering the density of cereal and the visible portion, I estimate the weight of the cereal mix to be approximately 80 grams.",16676.44518503217,78.78813000301611,43.93491124260355

The image shows half of an apple (pomme) being held in a hand. Based on the size of the hand and the visible dimensions of the apple, it appears to be a medium-sized apple. A typical medium apple weighs around 180-200 grams when whole. Since only half of the apple is shown, we can estimate its weight to be approximately half of that, which is 90-100 grams. Considering the density and size, I estimate the weight of this half apple to be 95 grams.",16704.44518503217,78.92041644749555,44.082840236686394

The image shows a bowl of cereal with milk. The cereal appears to be granola, which is dense and clusters together. The bowl is not completely filled, and the cereal is spread out on the surface of the milk. Based on the visible volume of the cereal and its density, I estimate the weight of the cereal to be approximately 50 grams. This estimation accounts for the fact that granola is heavier than it appears due to its compactness.",16732.44518503217,79.05270289197502,44.23076923076923
