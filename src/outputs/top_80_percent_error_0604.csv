The image shows a flan aux asperges in a small, rounded white ceramic ramekin on a plate. The target food item is the asperges en décoration, which are the four green asparagus spears placed on top of the flan. Step 1: There are exactly four whole asparagus spears visible on top, with tips and stems, arranged neatly. Step 2: Each asparagus spear is thin, typical of green asparagus, about 12-14 cm long, judging by the size of the spoon and fork nearby and the ramekin. The diameter of each spear is roughly 1-1.5 cm. Given the thinness and length, each spear likely weighs around 10-12 grams. Step 3: Asparagus is a vegetable of moderate density, fairly water-rich but compact. Step 4: For four spears, estimating each at about 11 grams, total weight is roughly 44 grams. Given the relatively small size and typical Swiss portion sizes (which tend to be slightly smaller than US portions), a conservative estimate is around 40-45 grams. Step 5: No hidden parts or multiple layers; the asparagus are fully visible and flat on the flan surface. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the asparagus decoration to be approximately 43 grams.",295.4954128440367,1.169905689542488,0.15015015015015015

The image shows a soup bowl filled with green soup, labeled as 'soupe courgette' (zucchini soup). The bowl is relatively small, placed on a standard-sized plate for scale, indicating the bowl diameter is about 10-11 cm and the soup fills most of it. Typical depth of such bowls is around 5-6 cm. Assuming the soup fills the bowl to near the top, and considering the soup's density is close to water (about 1g/ml) because it is a blended vegetable soup, the volume can be estimated. Calculating volume roughly as a cylinder: volume = π * r^2 * h, with radius ~5 cm and height ~5.5 cm, yields approximately 430 ml. Given the liquid nature, weight in grams will be close to volume in ml. Considering some air bubbles and slight variations, I estimate the weight range between 400-450 grams.

Considering some tomatoes are slightly smaller and including the density and water-content of fresh tomatoes, a reasonable average per tomato is about 14 grams. Multiplying 19 tomatoes by 14 grams gives approximately 266 grams. Adjusting slightly for possible moisture loss under sunlight and the fact that some tomatoes may be smaller leads to an estimate near the middle to lower end of that range.

Each cherry tomato is roughly spherical and of typical size, about 2.5 to 3 cm in diameter, which is standard for Swiss cherry tomatoes, usually a bit smaller than US sizes. Considering that an average cherry tomato weighs about 15 grams, and since these look fresh and dense (standard water content), I multiply 18 tomatoes by 15 grams each to get around 270 grams. The container is shallow and does not appear to hold additional hidden tomatoes underneath, so no added weight for hidden volume is needed. The density of tomatoes means they are quite heavy for their volume, so 15 grams per tomato is a good estimate rather than under or overestimating. The portion seems medium to large for a single package, so I keep at the mid to upper range estimation.

The thickness of the crust is moderate, and the toppings are distributed evenly across the slice, with the cheese melted and the mushroom slices fairly thick. Given the density of cooked pizza ingredients—pizza dough, melted mozzarella, and ham—a typical square slice of this size in Switzerland would weigh less than a full round pizza slice from bigger portions. Estimating the slice dimensions roughly at about 12x12 cm with moderate thickness, and accounting for the toppings, the total weight is likely in the range of 110-140 grams.

The dessert has a biscuit base soaked with red fruit juices, a middle layer with mixed red berries (fruits rouges) like raspberries and blackcurrants embedded in a creamy mixture of séré and mascarpone. The slice is roughly rectangular, approximately 8cm by 7cm based on plate size and raspberry size. The depth/thickness of the piece is around 3cm judging by the height of the creamy layer and base biscuit seen on the edges. The biscuit layer is dense but thin (about 0.5cm), the red fruit layer is mixed within the cream and berries are light but dense. The creamy mascarpone/séré mixture is quite light but dense and adds volume. Considering the total volume (~8*7*3=168 cm³) and the mixed density of creamy cheese and fruit, a density factor around 0.9 g/cm³ seems appropriate (slightly less than water because of air in cream). This gives an approximate weight of ~150 grams. Given the slice’s moderate size and typical portion sizes in Swiss desserts, a weight between 140-160 grams is expected.

The green salad consists of loose leaf lettuce with visible multiple leaves layered in a small pile. Comparing the size of the leaves to the plate and nearby knife handle, the salad portion roughly spans about 10 cm by 8 cm in surface area, with moderate volume due to leaf layering and some natural leaf curl. Lettuce is a light food with relatively low density and volume can be deceiving; the leaves appear fresh and crisp, not wilted or compacted.

The gratin de légumes is located on the bottom left part of the plate. It consists mainly of layers of cooked vegetables like eggplant and red pepper, covered with a tomato-based sauce and some melted cheese. Visually, the gratin covers approximately one-third of the plate area. Considering the typical thickness of a vegetable gratin, I estimate a depth of about 2-3 cm. Cooked vegetables typically retain density, so the volume corresponds closely to the weight. Given the plate size and comparing the gratin with the other items (salad and cheese slice), the gratin portion appears medium-sized but not overly large. Using typical density of cooked vegetable gratins (~0.8-1 g/cm³) and estimating the total volume as roughly 15-20 cubic centimeters, I calculate a weight range between 120 and 160 grams. Taking a moderate portion size in a Swiss context, my best estimate for the gratin de légumes weight is 140 grams.",4070.692776586642,16.116414782458197,3.1531531531531534

Step 2: dimension analysis shows the slice is about 12 cm in length and 10 cm in width, with a very thin crust (around 0.3 cm) and a topping depth approximately 0.5 to 0.7 cm thick due to the cooked fruit and crema. The diced fruit pieces are small, evenly spread, and lightly browned, indicating some moisture loss during baking but still retaining density. Step 3: density considerations point out that cooked apple and rhubarb retain moderate density; the crust is light but adds weight, while the cream base contributes to the overall weight. Step 4: portion size calibration for a single slice of this size with visible moderate thickness leads to an estimated total weight in the range of 130 to 160 grams. Given typical Swiss portion sizes and the moderate amount of fruit topping, a medium estimate around 145 grams is reasonable.

The image shows a stainless steel bowl containing a base of white creamy yaourt nature (plain yogurt) topped with visible pieces of pineapple (ananas), blueberries (myrtilles), and pecan nuts (noix de pécan). The target food item is 'yaourt nature'. Visually, the yogurt occupies the bottom half of the bowl with a thin but complete layer beneath the toppings. The bowl diameter appears to be about 12-14 cm based on typical breakfast bowl sizes, and the yogurt layer thickness seems around 2-3 cm.

Each fallafel appears to be about the size of a golf ball, roughly 3-4 cm in diameter. Considering the density of fallafels, which are made from ground chickpeas and fried, they have a moderately dense and compact texture. Typically, a single fallafel of this size weighs between 30 and 40 grams. Given the portion size here, and accounting for some variation in size among them, I estimate each fallafel weighs approximately 35 grams on average. Multiplying 9 by 35 grams gives about 315 grams in total. This is consistent with a medium to large portion of fallafels in a Swiss context.

The sauce is mixed thoroughly with the tortellini, so the volume of sauce is not easily separable from the pasta. The portion of tortellini with sauce occupies about one-third of the plate’s surface area. Considering the Swiss portion context, the typical sauce to pasta ratio is about 1:2 by weight, meaning sauce weighs about half as much as pasta, or slightly less. For visual scale, the tortellini portion looks to be medium-sized, with about 10-12 tortellini pieces, each averaging approximately 15 grams with sauce included, totaling roughly 150-180 grams. Estimating the sauce alone by visual volume, it appears to be a moderate coating, roughly 40-50 grams. Tomato sauce is moderately dense but mostly water, so its volume distribution fits this weight.

The pizza has a thin base that is slightly charred, some cheese, tomato sauce, cherry tomato pieces, and basil leaves. The toppings and cheese layer are not very thick, suggesting an average density. Compared to the plate size and glassware nearby, the thickness is relatively thin but with moderate toppings, so it is neither extremely light nor heavy. Thin-crust pizza slices in Swiss portions tend to weigh less than US portions. Based on these observations, a typical single slice like this would weigh in the range of 90 to 120 grams.

Given the density of cooked bulgur (roughly 120-130 g per 100 cm3), and estimating the volume (8 cm x 10 cm x 1.5 cm = 120 cm3), the weight estimate before adjustment is approximately 140-160 grams. Since Swiss portions tend to be slightly smaller and this portion does not fill the entire section perfectly evenly, adjusting slightly downward is reasonable. Therefore, the estimated weight of the bulgur portion on this plate is about 150 grams.",8107.163192897579,32.097338683312586,9.15915915915916

Each slice appears to be a typical medium size, about the size of a Swiss standard slice, with a visible thin to medium crust, a layer of cheese, tomato sauce, and a generous topping of cooked spinach. The spinach is well distributed and slightly cooked down, so its weight is denser than fresh spinach but lighter than meat or cheese. Comparing the slices to the plate and considering their volume, I estimate each slice to weigh approximately 100-120 grams. Combined, the two slices together should weigh around 200 to 240 grams. Taking the middle value for a reasonable estimate based on the visual evidence, the total weight of the pizza aux épinards (two slices) is approximately 220 grams.",9795.65879457492,38.782317621420155,12.462462462462462

The chocolate sauce is visible mainly covering some parts of the ice cream as a smooth, glossy layer pooled at the bottom and some spread over the ice cream surface. Compared to the bowl size (standard small dessert bowl) and a metal spoon, the sauce coverage and quantity appear moderate but not excessive, approximately filling a thin layer over the ice cream plus some pooling underneath. Considering the density of chocolate sauce is somewhat thick but fluid, a realistic volume would be close to about 30 ml, roughly equivalent to 30 grams (chocolate sauce density is close to that of water but slightly higher).

The image shows three slices of whole wheat bread (pain complet) on a plate, each spread with some butter (beurre). The target food to estimate is 'beurre'. Step 1: Visual Identification - The butter is visibly spread unevenly across the three slices; none is in large chunks, but rather spread thinly across the surface. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each slice of bread seems standard-sized for Swiss portions, roughly 10 cm by 10 cm. The butter coverage is partial, about half the surface area on each slice, with a thin thickness around 2-3 mm on average. Step 3: Density Considerations - Butter is dense and fatty, about 0.9 g/cm3. A thin layer over the slices suggests small total volume. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Typical butter spread thickness for a light to medium spread on bread is about 5-10 grams per slice. Given the moderate amount spread, I estimate approximately 5 grams of butter per slice. Across three slices, this totals approximately 15 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - This matches general typical butter serving sizes as well as the visual film of butter on the bread.

Visually, the risotto covers about half the plate's surface in a flattened mound approximately 1.5 to 2 cm thick. The plate is a standard dinner plate (~25cm diameter), so the risotto portion roughly occupies a circular area of about 12 cm in diameter. Risotto is a dense cooked rice dish, typically dense and moist, meaning a small volume weighs more than expected. Given the flattened shape and size, and comparing with the size of the salad leaves, this represents a medium portion typical of a Swiss meal. Estimating the volume as a 12 cm diameter circle × 1.7 cm thickness gives about 190 cm³. Cooked risotto density is close to 1.2 g/cm³ due to moisture and starch, so weight approximates 228 grams. Considering edges and irregularities that slightly reduce volume, and parmesan layered on top adds only minor weight, a final conservative estimate rounds to 220 grams for the risotto au safran.",10143.800527523344,40.16065710298264,13.213213213213214

The bulgur portion appears as cooked grains, occupying roughly one-third of the container's base. Comparing to the container size—about 15cm square—and portion sizes typical in Swiss servings, the bulgur forms a compact layer roughly 10cm by 7cm wide and about 1.5-2cm deep. Bulgur is a cooked grain and is fairly dense, so the volume directly correlates well with weight. Estimating volume as roughly 105-140 cm3 (10x7x1.5cm to 10x7x2cm) and using a density of cooked bulgur at approximately 0.8g/cm3, the weight estimate ranges from 84g to 112g.

Each slice of bread appears medium-sized, about 10-12 cm long and 5-6 cm wide. Bread slices of this size generally weigh about 40-50 grams each, but since we only estimate the chocolate spread, we consider its volume and density. Chocolate spread has a density close to 1.2 g/cm3 and a thin spread over roughly 60-70 cm2 per slice. Multiplying the surface area by thickness (0.15-0.2 cm) gives 9-14 cm3 per slice, times three slices totals 27-42 cm3 of spread. Applying the density gives a weight range of approximately 32-50 grams total.

The container is a small rectangular metal dish, so the pasta portion is smaller than typical US servings, consistent with Swiss portion sizes. By comparing the size of the pasta strands and relative volume to the container width, the quantity corresponds roughly to about 85 to 110 grams of cooked tagliatelles. The cheese and sauce add little weight directly to the pasta volume itself as they are separate ingredients, and the density of cooked pasta is fairly high.

Considering the flakes' light density and a typical Swiss portion, the cereal portion here seems medium-sized. A typical portion of dry breakfast cereal ranges from 30-50 grams, but soaked cereals absorb moisture and appear heavier though their dry weight does not change. Given that this is a mixed portion with yogurt and fruits, the cereal component is reasonably estimated at around 40 grams dry weight equivalent.

Step 2: Dimension analysis considers the total surface area covered on three standard-sized slices of whole grain bread. Each slice appears to be of typical Swiss bread size, about 10x10 cm, with the jam covering around half of the surface per slice. The depth of the jam is thin, approximately 2-3 mm thick on average. Step 3: Density consideration for jam is relatively dense due to sugar content; typical strawberry jam density is about 1.3 g/cm3. Step 4: Calculate the volume of jam spreading on three slices: area per slice covered approximately 50 cm², thickness about 0.25 cm, so volume per slice is about 12.5 cm³; for three slices total volume is about 37.5 cm³. Using density 1.3 g/cm³, mass = volume × density = 37.5 × 1.3 = 48.75 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation with typical portion sizes of jam on toast suggests 15-20 g per slice is common in Swiss portions, totaling 45-60 g for three slices.

Given the Swiss portion habits, which tend to be smaller than US portions, and the fact that the container looks roughly standardized for a single small yogurt, the volume is likely around 120 ml. Considering the density of yogurt close to water (~1 g/ml), the weight should closely match the volume. Therefore, the moat yogurt in this container is estimated to weigh approximately 120 grams.",12294.89728242462,48.677135609685024,18.31831831831832

The penne pieces are layered mostly flat with some slight piling, and I estimate a depth similar to a single layer with some thickness added by the sauce. Comparing to the brochettes of sausages on the right (which typically weigh around 100-120 grams for three small sausages), the pasta portion appears slightly larger in volume but less dense than meat. Considering cooked penne pasta with a creamy sauce, density is moderate to high.

Step 2: Dimension analysis - Each beef chunk appears roughly 3 to 4 cm in length and about 2 to 3 cm wide, typical for stew meat cubes. The depth/thickness is estimated at around 2 cm for each chunk. Step 3: Density considerations - Beef stew meat is dense with a typical density around 1 g/cm³. Step 4: Portion size calibration - Counting four larger visible pieces plus smaller fragments suggests a moderate portion size. Estimating volume: assuming each large piece roughly 3 cm × 2.5 cm × 2 cm = 15 cm³, times 4 pieces = 60 cm³, plus about 40% more volume for smaller pieces and overlap (about 24 cm³), totaling around 84 cm³. At density ~1 g/cm³, this is approximately 84 grams.

The image shows a plate with four distinct food items: cooked broccoli florets, penne pasta, three pieces of breaded fish, and a small serving of mayonnaise. Focusing on the 'pâtes' (pasta), they are located at the top center of the plate. The pasta appears to be whole-grain penne, cooked but not overfilled on the plate. Counting the penne pieces, there are around 14 visible pieces in a spread that covers approximately a third of the plate's surface. Each penne piece is about 3-4 cm long and somewhat dense, typical of cooked pasta. Given Swiss portion sizes, this serving would be considered medium-small. Cooked pasta typically weighs around 8-10 grams per piece. Using a conservative estimate closer to 8 grams because the pieces are not densely piled, 14 pieces × 8 grams = 112 grams. Accounting for some spaces between the pieces and slight visual undercounting, a total weight around 110 grams is a reasonable estimate for the pasta portion on the plate.",13504.856991849163,53.46752722540893,21.47147147147147

There is no visible spoon or hand size reference except for a slightly visible spoon in the background, but the container height and diameter are consistent with known single-serving yogurt containers. Given this, and assuming the yogurt fully fills the container except for a small empty space at the top, it is reasonable to estimate the yogurt weight as about 125 grams, which is a common single portion.

The plate is a standard dinner plate of about 25 cm diameter, and each asparagus spear is roughly 15–18 cm long, thin and cooked (which slightly reduces weight). Considering the typical weight of one cooked spear is approximately 10-15 grams, and accounting for slight shrinkage in cooking and mild variation in thickness, a medium portion weight would be around 12 grams per spear. Multiplying by 9 spears yields approximately 108 grams. Given the Swiss portion context and the apparent size, this seems reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'asperges' to be around 110 grams.",14576.183653889631,57.70905214526015,24.474474474474473

The image shows a blue plate containing a piece of bread ('pain') and two skewers with grilled shrimp ('crevettes'). The target food is 'pain'. The piece of bread looks like a small rustic roll, about half the size of an adult hand, approximately 7-8 cm in length and about 5-6 cm in width and height. Given its size and typical density of fresh white bread, this portion is likely a small roll or bun. In Switzerland, smaller bread rolls typically weigh around 45-60 grams depending on density. The piece is not overly dense or thick but appears to be a standard medium-small roll. Therefore, taking a moderate estmate within the typical range for such a bread roll, I estimate the weight of the 'pain' to be approximately 50 grams.",14626.494578259379,57.90823979457021,24.624624624624623

The pizza toppings include olives, onions, bell peppers, and some leafy greens, all of which add volume but are generally light except for the olives which are denser. The pizza crust is thick around the edges, making the base fairly dense. Considering the thickness of the crust, the moderate amount of cheese, sauce, and dense toppings like olives, a medium 25-28 cm pizza commonly weighs approximately between 300g to 400g. This pizza does not appear overly thick or deep, so it is not on the higher end of that range.

Each piece appears to be about the size of a typical piadina flatbread, roughly 20-22 cm in diameter before folding, and is folded in half. The pita bread or piadina is thin but has some thickness and density as it is a cooked flatbread. Using the plate (about 25 cm in diameter) and the bread knife as size references, each unfolded piadina likely weighs around 80-90 grams, considering typical Swiss portion sizes which are slightly smaller than US ones.

The bread appears thin (~3-5 mm thickness) and slightly flexible. Lebanese flatbread is light but denser than some flatbreads, typically weighing around 80-110 grams for a full piece. Given this is about half a piece, the expected weight is roughly half that, around 40-55 grams. Taking into account Swiss portion sizes, which tend smaller, I estimate a medium portion weight near 45 grams for this bread slice.",15594.85777748162,61.742118653839036,27.62762762762763

The gratin appears layered with visible leafy and stem pieces, with a creamy top that suggests some cheese or béchamel that adds density. Comparing to the total plate size, which is likely a standard Swiss dinner plate around 25 cm diameter, the gratin portion is approximately 7 cm by 5 cm in visible area with some depth. Considering the gratin depth is about 2.5 to 3 cm, and the food density is medium-high due to cooked vegetables and dairy, a volume estimate translates into roughly 100 to 150 grams.

The image shows a plate with three distinct food items: grilled salmon, brown rice (riz complet), and a carrot and corn salad. Focusing on the riz complet, the portion appears as a moderately sized mound on the plate, roughly rectangular, about 10 cm long and 6-7 cm wide, with a visible thickness of approximately 2-2.5 cm. Brown rice is dense and compact when cooked, so its visual volume corresponds relatively well to weight. Comparing to the plate diameter (approx. 26 cm) and the salmon portion size, this rice portion is moderate but not large. Estimating volume at about 10 cm x 7 cm x 2.5 cm = 175 cm3. Cooked brown rice density is about 1.3 g/cm3, so estimated weight = 175 x 1.3 = approximately 228 grams. However, considering Swiss portion sizes tend to be slightly smaller than US, and the rice is spread a bit loosely (not packed tightly), I will adjust downwards to a medium portion around 180 grams.

The target food item is 'riz et lentilles au curry,' which is the yellow-orange cooked mixture on the bottom right part of the plate. Step 1: Visual Identification shows the mixture clearly separate from the green haricots coco on the top left of the plate. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - the rice and lentil curry covers roughly 40% of a standard-sized medium plate, with a moderate thickness suggesting some volume below the surface visible. The mixture appears compact and dense, typical of cooked lentils and rice blended with spices like curry, which add moisture and density. Comparing portion size to the haricot coco, which are relatively light and flat, the curry mixture's shape and volume indicate a moderate portion. Step 3: Density Considerations - cooked rice and lentils are dense due to absorption of water and cooking, suggesting a higher weight per volume ratio compared to raw grain or low-density vegetables. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - the portion appears medium size, not too small or overly large. Based on typical Swiss portion sizes, and given the observed volume and density, I estimate the weight range of this portion to be between 140 to 180 grams, settling on a medium estimate. Step 5: Cross Validation - the visual depth and compactness suggest not to underestimate the weight, despite the seeming loose arrangement. Therefore, the estimated weight of 'riz et lentilles au curry' is approximately 160 grams.",16535.76751613394,65.46730560683,30.78078078078078

Estimating the volume as a cylinder with diameter 10 cm and height 2 cm gives about 157 cm³. Multiplying by density gives about 95-110 grams. The balsamic cream drizzled on top adds negligible weight. Considering Swiss portion sizes and a modest heap, the estimated weight is closer to the middle of that range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'salade de carottes' to be approximately 100 grams.",17421.22047217021,68.97293177245781,33.933933933933936

In the image, there are four croissants au fromage frais on a white plate with a floral pattern. Each croissant appears small compared to a standard croissant, more like miniature croissants, measuring roughly 7-9 cm in length. The croissants have a light, flaky pastry exterior with sesame seeds on top and appear to be filled with fromage frais, which is a soft, creamy, and not very dense cheese, so it adds some weight but not too much bulky density. Given their small size and lightweight filling, each croissant likely weighs between 35-45 grams. Since the target is one croissant au fromage frais, I focus on a single piece. Considering the Swiss portion context, these are on the smaller side, so I estimate closer to 40 grams per piece. This accounts for pastry density and creamy cheese filling without overestimation.",17462.22047217021,69.13525623228473,34.08408408408408

Step 1: Visual Identification - the dahl de lentille appears as a thick, orange-colored lentil stew with visible pieces of carrot and onion mixed in the bowl. It occupies roughly half of the bowl's volume. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - the bowl is a medium sized bowl typically holding around 400-500 ml. The dahl portion visually fills about half the bowl, so around 200-250 ml volume. Step 3: Density Considerations - cooked lentils and vegetable stew have a dense but moist consistency, with an estimated density approximately 1.0 g/ml, meaning volume in ml roughly equals grams in weight. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - given that the portion is about half a medium bowl, the weight would be in the range of 200-250 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - the mixed lentils and vegetables make the dish denser than plain liquids but less dense than solids, so the weight estimation around 230 grams is reasonable.

Comparing its size to the asparagus pieces, each about 10-12 cm long and about 1.5-2 cm in diameter, the mayonnaise volume appears to be about 15 ml. Considering mayonnaise density is close to water but slightly higher due to fat content, it weighs around 0.96 g/ml. Therefore, 15 ml roughly equals 14-15 grams. Given Swiss smaller portion context and visual size, the mayonnaise thomy portion is estimated at approximately 15 grams.",18302.889542860907,72.46357703211568,37.23723723723724

Comparing the cake size to the strawberry halves adjacent to it and the plate's dimensions, it is a moderate portion commonly served in Swiss context, smaller than US portion sizes. Chocolate cake density is relatively high due to ingredients like butter and chocolate. A standard dense chocolate cake of this size generally weighs about 100 to 130 grams. Given the visual size, thickness, and density, I estimate this piece weighs about 120 grams.",19101.600765568655,75.62578112440195,40.390390390390394

The target food item is the 'sauce tomates au thon' visible on top of the pasta in the bowl. Visually, the sauce covers roughly the central portion of the pasta, with a reasonably thick consistency, including tomato base and visible tuna flakes. The portion appears to be spread over an area about 10 cm in diameter with an estimated average depth of 1.5 to 2 cm, considering that sauces often have some volume and are not just a thin smear. Compared to the pasta, which is dense, the sauce is less dense but has tuna chunks that increase its density. Tomato sauce density with tuna is typically about 0.9 to 1 g/cm3. Estimating the volume as a cylinder of about 10 cm diameter and 1.5 cm height results in approximately 118 cm3. Multiplying by the density (approx. 1 g/cm3) gives roughly 118 grams. Considering the sauce is not packed solidly and some sauce pools around the pasta edges, I adjust to a more moderate portion weight. Given the Swiss portion context, a medium serving of this type of sauce on pasta is commonly around 90-110 grams. Hence, I estimate a reasonable weight of 100 grams for the 'sauce tomates au thon' in this plate.",19137.714952419865,75.76876199934614,40.54054054054054

A typical medium apple weighs around 150-180 grams fresh, but cooking and coring reduce weight. Peeled and cooked apples shrink but retain density. Each half appears moderately thick and not too reduced in size. Considering the size of the plate and visible depth, each half could weigh approximately 60-70 grams, for a total of around 125-140 grams.

The soufflé seems to be about 10 cm long, 7-8 cm wide, and roughly 3-4 cm thick, considering its puffed structure and some collapsing at the edges. Soufflé, due to its egg and cheese content, has moderate density but still lighter than dense meat or solid cheese. Given Swiss portion standards, this is a modest portion size.

The image shows a single piece of bread ('pain') with a visible topping of caviar d'aubergines (eggplant spread). The target food item to estimate is 'caviar d'aubergines'. First, I locate the eggplant spread on the bread slice, which covers most of the surface but not very thickly. The bread piece itself is roughly 10 cm long and about 5 cm wide, typical for a sliced baguette or country bread slice, with about 1.5 cm thickness of bread. The layer of caviar d'aubergines appears spread to an average thickness of approximately 0.5 cm, with some slight variation. Eggplant spread is a cooked vegetable purée with moderate density, generally close to 0.8-1 g/cm³ because of water content but more compact than raw vegetables. Considering the surface area of about 50 cm² and 0.5 cm thickness, the volume of spread is roughly 25 cm³. Using a density of approximately 0.9 g/cm³ for cooked eggplant purée, the estimated weight is about 22-23 grams. Given this is a single slice with moderate coverage and no excess heap, a medium portion weight estimate is reasonable.

The pasta portion appears moderate in size, spread in a relatively thin layer covering a small flattened area on the plate. The pasta shapes are penne and another shell type, cooked and coated with a creamy sauce, with visible small pieces of bacon or pancetta. Given the size of a standard dinner plate and the visual volume of the pasta with sauce and meat, the pasta carbonara portion looks typical of a Swiss medium serving, likely around 180-220 grams including sauce and meat. For the gruyère cheese topping, the volume is granular and moderately dense, covering the center of the pasta mound with an approximate depth of about 0.5 cm, forming a small pile. Using density estimates for grated cheese, and the spread and volume visible, the grated gruyère likely weighs around 15-20 grams. Since the target food item is specified as 'pâtes carbonara', I exclude the cheese topping from the estimate. Taking the pasta with sauce and meat, and being conservative but realistic about portion size and density, I estimate the weight of the pâtes carbonara itself to be approximately 200 grams.",19386.966685458177,76.7555828024283,41.591591591591595

These wraps are approximately the size of a small to medium tortilla wrap, roughly 15-18 cm in length and about 8-10 cm wide each when flattened. The visible depth is thin, about 2-3 mm. Since the wraps appear to be of a light, unleavened flatbread type (similar to a thin galette or lavash), their density is lower than bread but denser than very light wraps. From Swiss portion context, a typical flatbread or galette of this size weighs between 70 and 90 grams each if fully intact. There are two portions, but one is partially torn and folded, so the total portion represents about 1.7 to 2 full wraps in volume. Therefore, estimating total pain/galette weight, accounting for some overlap and folding, the range is approximately 110-140 grams.

The image shows a single slice of pizza on a white plate. The slice is thin-crust with visible tomato sauce, some melted cheese, and a couple of basil leaves. The plate size suggests a standard dinner plate of about 26-28 cm diameter. The pizza slice covers roughly one-sixth of a typical whole pizza. Considering a regular thin-crust pizza in a Swiss context, a whole pizza usually weighs around 300-350 grams. Since this slice is one out of approximately six slices, this indicates a portion size around 50-60 grams. The thin crust and moderate topping density suggest the lower-middle range of that spectrum. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this pizza slice to be about 55 grams.",19829.39017428768,78.50719631069639,43.54354354354354

The target food item is 'agneau' (lamb). In the image, the lamb piece is a single small sausage-shaped portion located on the lower left side of the plate. Compared to the fork and knife and other foods on the plate, it appears around 6-7 cm in length and about 2 cm in diameter. Lamb is dense and heavier than it might visually suggest. Given its shape and size, similar to a small lamb sausage or kebab piece, a realistic weight for this piece is between 40 and 60 grams. Considering it as a single medium portion, I estimate the lamb's weight to be about 50 grams.",19861.777929389722,78.6354237461097,43.693693693693696

The image shows two slices of pain bis (brown bread), open-faced. On one slice, there are several strips of fromage (cheese) neatly arranged in a single layer, and on top, two cornichons (small pickles). The fromage strips are relatively thin and cover about three-quarters of the bread slice's visible surface. Pain bis slice appears to be a typical slice about 10 cm long. Each strip of fromage looks approximately 8-10 cm long, 1-1.5 cm wide, and about 2-3 mm thick. Counting, there are about 7 strips of fromage in total. Given that the density of semi-hard cheese is about 1.1 g/cm³, and estimating the volume per strip as roughly 10 cm × 1.3 cm × 0.25 cm = 3.25 cm³, per strip weight would be about 3.6 grams, so 7 strips × 3.6 g ≈ 25 grams. This portion size aligns with a small to medium Swiss cheese sandwich topping. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the fromage to be approximately 25 grams.",19894.142512723054,78.76355944140498,43.84384384384384

The image shows three slices of seeded bread, each spread with chocolate hazelnut spread ('pâte à tartiner au chocolat'). The target food is the chocolate spread only. Each slice has a thin and even layer covering most of its surface, with some parts showing the spread more thickly than others. The spread thickness appears about 2-3 mm on average, and the total spread area is roughly equivalent to the combined area of the three medium-sized slices. Given the typical density of chocolate spread is around 1.2 g/cm³, and estimating the total spread volume as approximately 60 cm³ (considering each slice's spread surface area about 100 cm² and spread thickness about 2 mm), the total weight is around 70-75 grams. Taking into account the small Swiss portion sizes and the visible thinness, I estimate the weight of the chocolate spread to be about 70 grams.",19926.365653218923,78.8911351456713,43.993993993993996

The image shows a single tartelette au citron, a small lemon tart, placed on a flat surface. Based on visual comparison with the surface and the typical size of such tartelettes, the diameter is about 6-7 cm, a common size for individual tartlets. The crust is thin but firm, contributing to part of the weight, and the lemon filling appears thick and creamy, occupying most of the volume. The depth, considering the crust and filling together, is roughly 2.5-3 cm. Considering the density of a lemon curd filling and a short pastry crust, the item is moderately dense. Typical small lemon tartlets weigh between 70-100 grams in Swiss portions, which are on the smaller side compared to US portions. Given the size and typical makeup, this tartelette is likely around a medium portion size. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the tartelette au citron to be approximately 85 grams.",19990.365653218923,79.14451966832796,44.294294294294296

The image shows a single hazelnut ice cream cone held in a hand, which provides a clear size reference. The cone is a standard small to medium size typical in Swiss servings, with the ice cream portion shown shaped as a single scoop roughly the size of a small fist. The waffle cone itself is thin and lightweight; thus, it should not contribute to the weight estimate. The ice cream appears to have some small hazelnut pieces mixed in, adding a bit more density than plain ice cream. Generally, a small to medium ice cream scoop on a cone in Switzerland ranges between 80 and 120 grams of ice cream. Given the moderate size and the visible inclusion of nuts, I estimate the hazelnut ice cream portion weighs approximately 110 grams, excluding the cone.",20022.365653218923,79.27121192965629,44.44444444444444

The salad mainly consists of leafy greens, which are light in density, and a few visible sunflower seeds, which are dense but present in a small quantity. The bowl itself is small, likely about 10 cm in diameter, indicating a small portion size. The salad leaves are coated with the sauce, but the overall volume remains low. Considering the typical density of fresh lettuce mixed with a little creamy dressing, and the visible volume filling about half the bowl's depth, I estimate the salad portion weight to be in the range of 50 to 70 grams. Given the modest amount and the cream sauce which adds some weight, I place the estimate closer to the mid-to-upper range at 65 grams.",20054.365653218923,79.39790419098462,44.5945945945946

Visually, the noodles are submerged but clearly occupy about half the bowl's volume, tightly packed but flexible in the broth. The bowl is medium-sized, likely around 15 cm diameter, so the noodles likely fill around 300-350 ml of volume. Cooked noodles are dense due to absorbed water, roughly 140-160g per cup (240ml). Given the noodles' volume and density, the portion is medium-sized but not large. Taking account for noodles volume under the broth and their compact nature, the weight estimate ranges between 120-160 grams.

The muffin appears dense and baked, with a typical depth of around 3-4 cm, allowing estimation of its volume. Rhubarb muffins are denser than average fruits but lighter than solid cake due to inclusion of fruit pieces. Standard small muffins in a Swiss context often weigh between 70 and 90 grams.
