The image shows a transparent glass filled with cider (cidre) placed on a surface. The cider appears golden and fills the glass almost to the brim. Comparing the glass size to the visible size of a human hand in the back left corner, this glass is likely a standard small drinking glass used in Switzerland for beer or cider servings, holding about 20 to 25 cl (milliliters). Since cider has a density close to water (approximately 1 g/ml), the weight in grams will closely match the volume in milliliters. Given the nearly full glass and typical pouring sizes in Switzerland, the volume is around 220 ml. Therefore, the estimated weight of the cider in the glass is approximately 220 grams.",280.0,1.0867945969701596,0.14925373134328357

The biscuit is dense but thin, the fruits rouges layer adds moisture and some weight, and the creamy séré+mascarpone layer is substantial and dense. Considering typical densities: biscuit (approx. 300 g/1000 cm3), fruits rouges (approx. 400 g/1000 cm3), and creamy mascarpone mixture (approx. 500 g/1000 cm3). By volume approximation: 8x8x3 = 192 cm3 total volume. Estimating breakdown: biscuit ~30% volume = 58 cm3, fruits rouges ~20% volume = 38 cm3, mascarpone+seré ~50% volume = 96 cm3. Calculating weights for these volumes: biscuit ~17 g, fruits rouges ~15 g, mascarpone ~48 g. Summing these gives approximately 80 grams total. Considering the visible moist consistency and slight compaction, correcting slightly upwards to 85 grams.

Although the vegetables and herbs occupy volume, they are low in density. The beef portion is partially visible beneath the vegetables but seems relatively modest in thickness and spread along the sandwich length. Considering the thickness and distribution of the beef inside, and comparing it visually to the bread's size and the leafy and root vegetable volume, I estimate the beef portion weighs about 70 to 90 grams. Lean cooked beef is dense, so even small thickness means reasonable weight.

Considering typical density of canned or cooked tuna flakes, each flake is dense but small. The tuna portion looks to be about 20-25% of the total dish volume. Comparing to the container size, I estimate the total dish volume to roughly represent about 450-500 grams of food. Applying 20-25% proportion to this total gives approximately 90-125 grams of tuna. Given the modest but visible amount of tuna, a mid-range estimation of 110 grams is reasonable and consistent with the density and chunk size, accounting for some small hidden tuna pieces mixed in the salad.

The portion nearly fills the plate, with pieces spanning an estimated 18 cm diameter. The salad has visible depth due to the layering of cubed vegetables and cheese, roughly around 3-4 cm thick considering the volume. Feta cheese is dense but only a part of the salad by volume, vegetables are less dense but compact. Typical Greek salad portion in Switzerland is smaller than US portions, and this seems to be a moderate portion.

The image shows a small portion of risotto aux asperges (asparagus risotto) on a rectangular plate. Step 1: The risotto is visibly clumped into a compact mass with visible pieces of asparagus embedded within. There are no separate piles; the portion is a single heap about 7-8 cm wide and 5-6 cm deep visually. Step 2: Using the plate as a reference (typical small Swiss plate width is roughly 20 cm), the risotto portion occupies less than half the plate surface, suggesting a small to medium Swiss portion. The depth/thickness of the risotto appears to be around 1.5-2 cm. Step 3: Risotto is cooked rice and hence quite dense. Asparagus stalks are present, but visually sparse and embedded, contributing modestly to the total mass. Step 4: Estimating volume: approx 7 cm × 6 cm × 2 cm = around 84 cubic centimeters of food. Cooked rice density is about 1.3 g/cm3, so the rough weight estimate is 84 × 1.3 = approximately 109 grams. Adjusting slightly downward to account for some air space and vegetable content but conservative portion size, the estimate is about 100 grams. Step 5: Considering typical Swiss portion sizes and the visible amount, this aligns with a smaller portion rather than a large serving.

Focusing on the jambon cru, I count approximately 3 thin slices, which are overlapping and slightly folded. The slices have visible fat marbling and typical translucency of cured ham, making them relatively light but dense in meat content. Each thin slice of jambon cru typically weighs about 15-20 grams considering Swiss portion sizes, and here the slices appear to be medium-sized. Given there are three slices, the total weight should be in the range of 40-60 grams. I estimate this portion closer to the middle of that range because the slices are not overly large or thick. Therefore, the estimated weight of the jambon cru on the plate is approximately 50 grams.",4405.938853702401,17.101251931373813,3.1343283582089554

The target food item is 'graines de lin' (flax seeds) visible sprinkled liberally across a plate of tomato salad. In step 1, I locate the seeds which appear densely but thinly scattered over the surface of cut tomato slices. Given the small size of flax seeds, they are thinly layered, not piled, so the depth is minimal—likely less than a millimeter. For step 2, the seeds cover roughly the entire surface area of the tomato slices on the plate, approximately 20 cm in diameter. The volume of seeds is small in height but spread wide. Step 3 density considerations indicate flax seeds are dense but small. A tablespoon of flax seeds weighs about 10 grams and is roughly 15 ml in volume. Given the seeds spread thinly over the entire plate, I estimate roughly 2 tablespoons worth based on visual coverage, which leads to approximately 20 grams. Step 4 portion size suggests a medium portion given the even sprinkle over the plate. Step 5 notes no overlapping or clumping that would increase the weight significantly. Therefore, the estimated weight of the flax seeds on the salad is around 20 grams.",4552.715140055868,17.670950770560573,3.283582089552239

The container is resting on a flat surface, and judging by the hand shadow size and table surface, the container is small, typically about 10-12 cm in length, 6-7 cm in width, and around 4-5 cm deep. The hummus fills the container roughly 70-80% full. Considering density, hummus is fairly dense and creamy, close to 1 g/cm³. Estimating volume: around 10 cm × 6 cm × 4 cm = 240 cm³ total volume. 80% filled would be approximately 190-200 cm³ (or grams, since 1 cm³ ~1 gram for hummus). This gives a reasonable estimate between 180 and 200 grams. Given the visual fullness and Swiss portion context (moderate size), I estimate the weight of the hummus to be approximately 190 grams.",4697.715140055868,18.23375511542012,3.4328358208955225

The visible diced tomato pieces cover about half the bowl's surface with mixed ingredients, but the tomatoes are the dominant visible red pieces. Estimating volume, the tomato pieces probably occupy about 120-140 ml in aggregate. Considering the density of raw tomato which is close to water (~1 g/ml), this corresponds approximately to 120-140 grams. Since there is some dressing or seasoning visible but no indication of excess liquid, the weight estimate remains close to volume. Accounting for some minor compression and cut shape, a reasonable estimate is about 130 grams of diced tomato in this serving.",4842.526014760359,18.795825387603564,3.582089552238806

The pasta forms a visible layer covering most of a standard rectangular plate (approximately 20-25 cm long). The portion looks fairly thick, about 2-3 cm deep, as the pasta is piled slightly but not too much. Compared to the size of the plate and considering the Swiss portion context, this is a medium-sized serving of pasta. Cooked pasta is dense and compact, so the weight is higher than it looks for the volume.

The filling is dense with cooked spinach and egg custard, which are fairly dense ingredients, plus a layer of melted cheese which adds weight. The crust is also visible with a standard thickness. Considering the density of cooked spinach mixed with eggs and cheese, and the standard thickness of the crust, each slice likely weighs between 80-100 grams.

Visually, the salade verte occupies roughly one quarter of a small to medium-sized plate, next to the larger portion of potato salad and a smaller portion of cottage cheese. The lettuce leaves are loose with some volume but low density since lettuce is light and mostly air. Comparing to the knife size and the plate diameter (roughly 22-24 cm), the pile of leaves looks to have a surface area of about 10x7 cm and a depth around 2-3 cm, so the volume is moderate but the density is low. Given the nature of salad leaves, the density is about 0.15-0.2 g/cm3. Estimating volume at approximately 140-160 cm3 and multiplying by density, I get a weight range around 21-32 grams. Considering this is a fairly typical Swiss portion size and the salad is not overly packed, I estimate a medium serving weight of 27 grams for the salade verte.",5396.268153883007,20.945125262293534,4.17910447761194

The toppings (champignons, olives, courgettes) proportionally cover the pizza surface but are light compared to the dough and cheese. Visually estimating, the vegetable toppings represent approximately 15-20% of the total pizza weight. Taking a 325 gram total pizza as a reference, 20% corresponds to about 65 grams total vegetable toppings. Since five slices are present, the toppings on the visible pizza amount to approximately 54 grams. This aligns with the visual coverage and density: mushrooms and courgettes are moderately dense, olives smaller but dense too.

Step 2: Compared to the plate (standard medium-sized dinner plate around 25-27 cm diameter), the salad takes up roughly one-third of the plate area. The greens are loosely piled, so depth is around 3-4 cm at maximum. Step 3: The salad greens are very light, with low density. The tomatoes have moderate density. Step 4: Estimating typical Swiss salad mixed portions, a small to medium salad plate serving is around 50 to 90 grams. Given the volume and leafy nature, I'd place this as a medium portion, closer to 70-80 grams. Step 5: Cross-validating, salads tend to be underestimated if only volume is considered but given the visible size and number of leaves, 75 grams is a reasonable estimate.

The thickness of grated cheese is minimal but dense, estimated around 0.5 to 0.7 cm due to the volume visible. Grated cheese density is relatively high, so even a thin layer can weigh noticeably. Visually, this cheese amount corresponds to a moderate topping rather than a heavy heap, typical of a normal single serving. Swiss portion norms suggest a moderate grated cheese portion around 15-20 grams.

The image shows four pieces of sweet potato waffles ('gaufre à la patate douce') on a plate. Each waffle piece appears to be roughly the size of a standard homemade small waffle square, about 6-7 cm per side and approximately 1.5-2 cm thick. The waffles have some depth but are not very thick, likely around 2 cm. Considering density, sweet potato waffles are moderately dense, similar to other vegetable-based waffles but slightly denser than wheat waffles due to the sweet potato content. Each piece looks substantial but not overly large. Typically, a homemade small sweet potato waffle piece of this size would weigh around 40-50 grams. Since there are four pieces, the total estimated weight range is 160-200 grams.

The target food item is 'riz' (rice). The rice is located on the right side of the metal container, occupying about half of the container's base area. Visually, the rice layer is spread evenly with some depth, approximately 1.5 cm thick. Comparing the rice portion to the metal container (which is roughly the size of a standard lunchbox about 20 cm by 12 cm), the rice volume is about 20 cm x 6 cm x 1.5 cm. Since cooked rice density is approximately 0.85 g/cm3, this yields an approximate weight. Calculating volume: 20 cm x 6 cm x 1.5 cm = 180 cm3. Multiplying by density gives 180 cm3 x 0.85 g/cm3 = 153 grams. Considering slight compression and uneven surface, I adjust the weight between 140-160 grams, selecting 150 grams as a reasonable medium portion size consistent with Swiss portion standards.",10469.822436937226,40.63766591321545,12.388059701492537

The image shows a small metal bowl containing tiramisu aux fruits rouges with visible mixed red and black berries embedded in a creamy, layered mousse or mascarpone mixture. Step 1: Visual Identification - The portion is a single serving scoop, visibly mixing creamy layers with fruit berries including raspberries and blueberries. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The bowl is relatively small, approximately the size of a small dessert bowl (~10 cm diameter), and the portion occupies about half the bowl volume, estimating roughly 150 ml volume. The depth and density are typical of a tiramisu dessert: creamy but dense due to mascarpone and soaked biscuit layers. Step 3: Density Considerations - Tiramisu is fairly dense (mascarpone cheese, whipped cream, soaked biscuits), combined with the slight volume of dense berries. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given Swiss portion sizes and visible amount, this is a medium portion of tiramisu dessert likely prepared individually. Known typical tiramisu individual portions range around 120-150 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - The berries and creamy layers appear well mixed and dense, so the weight likely corresponds closely to volume in ml due to water and fat content. Considering the total mix and comparison with known dessert standards, an estimate near 140 grams is reasonable.",10541.822436937226,40.91712738100778,12.537313432835822

Comparing their size to the bowl and the knife handle in the background, each grape likely weighs about 4-5 grams. Grapes are moderately dense due to their juice content but relatively light in weight per volume. Multiplying about 21 grapes by an average of 4.5 grams each gives an estimated total weight between 85-95 grams.

The container lid size, based on the visible thumb for scale, appears to be roughly 12 cm in length and 6 cm in width. The hummus covers most of the lid with a thickness averaging about 1.5 to 2 cm, accounting for the uneven surface. Homemade hummus is dense due to the chickpea and tahini base. Given these dimensions, the volume can be approximated around 12 cm x 6 cm x 1.7 cm = about 122 cubic centimeters. The density of hummus is roughly 1 g/cm3, so the weight is close to the volume in grams. Considering some air pockets in the uneven surface and possible slight inaccuracies, the weight should be slightly lower than the volume estimate.

The porridge fills the bowl to about 2/3 of its height, which I estimate to be around 5-6 cm deep. Considering the density of porridge with soaked oats and chia seeds, which is moderately dense but not too compact, a typical Swiss breakfast portion size would be smaller than US portions. Based on visual volume and density, the porridge likely weighs between 180-240 grams for a medium portion.

The image shows a bowl containing tomato soup ('soupe à la tomate') with visible tomato chunks and a liquid broth. Step 1: Visual Identification - The soup is the only food item in the bowl, consisting of several large tomato pieces suspended in liquid. There appear to be about 5-6 chunks of whole or nearly whole tomatoes. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The bowl is medium-sized, approximately 15 cm in diameter based on common tableware proportions. The tomato pieces are roughly 3-5 cm each in size and submerged in a liquid soup that seems to fill about half of the bowl's depth. Assuming the bowl depth is about 5 cm, the soup portion visually fills around 2.5 to 3 cm in height. Step 3: Density Considerations - Tomato soup has moderate density, with both liquid and solid chunks. Tomato flesh density is close to water, about 0.9 g/cm3. Considering the broth adds volume but not much weight, a mostly water-based soup with tomato chunks suggests moderate weight per volume. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Calculating volume roughly as a cylinder: diameter ~15 cm, height ~3 cm gives volume ≈ π × (7.5 cm)^2 × 3 cm ≈ 530 cm3. With density close to water (~1 g/cm3), this correlates to approximately 500 grams. Given the sparse tomato chunks and watery broth, the real weight might be slightly less. A small to medium portion in Swiss context would be closer to 450-500 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The visible tomato quantity supports this moderate volume, and the liquid content likely outweighs the solid chunks. The herbal sprinkle is negligible in weight. Final estimate: the soup weighs about 470 grams.",10893.822436937226,42.28338344577027,13.283582089552239

Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Comparing the gruyère pile to the size of the penne pasta and the meatballs (about 5-6 meatballs visible), the volume of cheese appears moderate. The pile is not very thick but covers a small central area. Step 3: Density Considerations - Gruyère is dense cheese, so even a small volume has notable weight. Finely grated cheese packs slightly less dense than a solid block but still dense compared to cooked vegetables or pasta. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given that Swiss portions are typically moderate and the pile is visibly moderate, I estimate the grated cheese to be a small to medium portion between 15g to 25g. Step 5: Cross-validation - The pile is not large enough for 30g and not small enough for under 10g.

There is no visible pool or amount of dressing separate from the salad ingredients; the dressing appears lightly mixed throughout. Mustard salad dressings are typically oil and vinegar based with a slightly viscous texture but generally applied in small quantities to avoid overpowering the salad. Given the salad's appearance, the sauce layer is very thin and absorbed into the vegetables. Estimating visually, the total volume of the mustard salad dressing is small, approximately 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml). The density of mustard-based salad dressing is close to that of water but slightly higher due to oil and mustard. This results in about 15 to 30 grams of dressing.

Visually, there are about 4-5 medium-sized chicken pieces mixed with sauce, covering an area roughly equivalent to a small palm-sized portion. Considering Swiss portion sizes, which tend to be smaller than US portions, and assessing the thickness and density of the chicken pieces, the portion looks like a moderate single serving. A typical cooked chicken breast piece is approximately 100-120 grams per medium portion; however, as this is a sauced dish with visible chicken chunks, the weight might be slightly less due to sauce volume and irregular pieces.

Step 1: Visual identification shows a mixed portion of vegetables located on the right side of the plate, with visible pieces of orange carrots and green leeks interspersed with small white fish flakes. Step 2: Dimension analysis reveals the vegetable portion nearly fills about 1/4 of the plate surface area, with a notable thickness and some layering underneath the top layer. The plate diameter is average (about 22 cm), so the vegetable pile is roughly 10 cm in length and width, with an estimated depth of 2-3 cm, indicating some volume. Step 3: Density considerations take into account that cooked carrots and leeks retain moisture and moderate density; cooked vegetables are heavier than might be initially perceived but less dense than meat or fish. Step 4: Considering this a medium portion typical of Swiss servings where vegetables are modest, the weight range for such a portion of sautéed carrots and leeks is approximately 80-110 grams. Given the volume shown, I lean toward the middle to upper part of this range.

Each slice appears to be roughly 10 cm long and about 4-5 cm wide, with about 1.5 cm thickness. Given the typical density and size of braided bread, an average slice might weigh between 35 and 45 grams. Since there are two slices present, but the target is only one slice of pain tressé, I focus on one slice. The bread is plain and no additional toppings are included in the estimation.

Since liquids have a density roughly equivalent to water (1 g/ml), the weight in grams corresponds closely to the volume in milliliters. The glass is nearly full with about 90-95% liquid capacity, so the actual liquid volume inside is around 225-285 ml.

Comparing to the plate which is a standard medium-sized plate (about 25 cm diameter), the portion occupies roughly a quarter of the plate. The volume and thickness appear moderate, around 1.5 to 2 cm thick on average. Cooked rice and lentils are dense foods, so this portion likely weighs more than it appears. Typical cooked rice or lentil servings of this visible size usually range from 150 to 220 grams. Given the volume and density visible, I estimate it closer to a medium portion in that range, around 180 grams, considering the curry mixtures add some moisture but not much volume.

Each wedge is quite thick and firm, about 2 cm thick, 2-3 cm wide, and 6-8 cm long. Comparing the size to the broccoli florets and the plate size (standard small dinner plate), these potato pieces appear substantial. Pan-fried potatoes have a medium density (denser than steamed potatoes due to some fat absorption), so weight will be higher than raw volume alone suggests. Typical density is around 0.8 to 0.9 g/cm3. Estimating each wedge's volume roughly as a rectangular prism: 2 cm x 3 cm x 7 cm = 42 cubic cm per wedge. For 10 wedges, total volume about 420 cubic cm. Multiplying by the density (approx 0.85 g/cm3) gives about 357 grams. Given Swiss portions are smaller, and the potatoes do not completely fill the plate (some plate area is visible), I estimate the portion as a medium size, so adjusting down slightly to about 280 grams. This is reasonable given the visual size, thickness, and density considerations for pan-fried potatoes.

The pieces vary in size, with some larger chunks around 5-6 cm in length and others smaller, possibly closer to 3-4 cm. The depth of the curry sauce suggests some chicken pieces may be partially submerged, indicating more volume than a flat surface suggests. Considering chicken's density (dense meat), and that the sauce adds weight but does not count as a separate food item, we focus only on the chicken pieces. Given Swiss portion sizes are generally smaller than US portions, this looks like a medium portion. A single medium chicken breast piece with sauce can weigh around 40-50 grams. Multiplying by the approximate visible pieces (5), this suggests a range of 200-250 grams total. Factoring a slight reduction for sauce volume and possible partial hiding, I estimate the weight of the chicken pieces themselves to be about 220 grams.",12275.800670960267,47.647406581008134,16.417910447761194

The image shows a single sandwich au fromage made with a seeded baguette-style bread roll, approximately 20-22 cm in length, typical of smaller Swiss portions. The bread is dense with a thick crust and a soft interior. The sandwich contains about 4-5 slices of semi-hard cheese, visible with some overlapping, each roughly 1-2 mm thick, plus a few leaves of lettuce. The cheese is denser than bread and leafy greens, so the cheese slices alone likely weigh around 40-50 grams in total. The baguette, considering its size and density, is estimated to weigh between 120-140 grams. Lettuce adds negligible weight, about 5 grams. Summing these estimates and considering the portion as medium-sized, the total weight of the sandwich au fromage (focusing only on the cheese inside) is about 45 grams of cheese. Since the prompt asks specifically for the weight of 'sandwich au fromage' as a whole food item, standard practice is to include the whole sandwich without container but taking everything inside (bread and filling). Therefore, combined the sandwich weighs approximately 165 grams. This reflects a typical medium-sized Swiss cheese sandwich with seeded bread. The main visual cue is the substantial bread size and visible cheese quantity.",13002.064148051639,50.466332377006935,18.208955223880597

The target food item is 'sauce soja'. In the image, the sauce soja is the dark liquid in the small white cup placed to the right of the plate. The cup appears to be a typical dipping sauce size, which usually holds about 30 ml of liquid. Given that soy sauce has a density close to water (~1 g/ml), the weight in grams is approximately equal to the volume in milliliters. The cup does not appear to be filled to the brim but is mostly full, so a reasonable estimate is around 25-28 grams. I will choose the middle point of this range as a typical medium portion for sauce soja served in such small dishes in a Swiss context, resulting in an estimated weight of 27 grams.",13061.064148051639,50.69533552422565,18.35820895522388

The target food is 'beurre de cacahuète' (peanut butter), which is visible as a creamy base in the bowl, partially covered by sliced strawberries on top. The bowl is moderately sized, and the peanut butter appears to be thick but smooth, filling about half to two-thirds of the bowl's visible volume. Given the Swiss portion context, this serving is medium-sized rather than an oversized portion. Peanut butter is a dense food, so the volume corresponds to a heavier weight than it might appear. Estimating the depth and volume of the peanut butter, it seems to be roughly 150 to 200 ml in volume, which translates to approximately 150 to 190 grams given peanut butter's density (~1 g/ml). Considering visual evidence and the medium portion size, I estimate the peanut butter weight to be around 170 grams.",13119.47935273,50.92206884145904,18.507462686567163

The target food is ""confiture framboise"" (raspberry jam), which is visible on two pieces of bread in the upper half of the image. The jam is spread in a thin layer, with some areas thicker than others but generally moderate coverage. Each piece of bread seems to be a small baguette slice approximately 6-7 cm in diameter, typical for Swiss portions. Raspberry jam is a dense sugary spread with a density slightly higher than water, but the applied volume here is moderate to low. Considering the visible surface area and estimated thickness (about 2-3 mm on average), and typical jam density (~1.3 g/cm³), the total jam weight on the two bread pieces looks to be about 15-20 grams.

The image shows a white plate with two main food components: spaghetti topped with parmesan on the left and ratatouille on the right. Focusing on the ratatouille, it appears as a moist vegetable stew containing visible chunks of zucchini, eggplant, and tomato sauce. The ratatouille portion covers about one-third of the plate. The plate diameter is standard, about 24 cm, so the ratatouille area is roughly 8 cm by 12 cm, with an estimated average depth of about 1.5 cm given the visible layering and moisture content. This volume corresponds to approximately 144 cubic centimeters. Ratatouille is composed mainly of cooked vegetables, which have a density close to water (~1 g/cm³), so the weight would be around 140 grams. Considering some moisture loss and potentially less density due to air pockets, the realistic range is about 120 to 150 grams. The portion is medium-sized for a Swiss context, so I estimate the ratatouille weight to be approximately 135 grams.",13235.700107971927,51.37316915879017,18.80597014925373

Visually, the oat flakes occupy about half of the bowl's base area, and are heaped in a shallow but visible layer with some depth. Given the bowl's size, comparable to a standard small cereal bowl of roughly 15 cm diameter, the oats form a relatively thin layer approximately 0.5 to 1 cm thick. Considering that dry oat flakes have a low density (about 0.3-0.4 g/cm³), and from the visual portion size, the estimated volume corresponds roughly to about 60-80 grams of oats. Since this is presented as a Swiss-sized portion, which tends to be moderate, a reasonable estimate is around the lower-middle of that range. Therefore, the oat flakes weigh approximately 70 grams.",13292.700107971927,51.59440948745909,18.955223880597014

The pancake thickness appears to be moderate, roughly 0.7 to 1 cm thick, indicating a medium density. Pancakes are moderately dense foods, with typical densities around 0.9 g/cm³. Calculating an estimated volume near 100-120 cm³ suggests a weight range between 90 and 110 grams. The sugar granules on top cover roughly the pancake's center with a thin layer; visually, this amounts to about 5-7 grams of sugar, considering the sugar's granule size and spread. Given these factors, the combined pancake and sugar weight is approximately 100-115 grams, with the pancake alone around 95 grams and the sugar about 7 grams. Since the target food item is 'pancake', I exclude sugar weight from the estimate. Therefore, I estimate the pancake alone to weigh 95 grams.",13349.619026890845,51.815335107267884,19.104477611940297

Using the plate diameter (approximately 25 cm) as reference, this size estimation seems accurate. Mashed potatoes have moderate density due to being cooked and mashed with some possible butter or milk, typically about 0.8 g/cm³. Volume is approximately 12 cm × 8 cm × 1.75 cm = 168 cm³. Multiplying by density: 168 × 0.8 = 134 grams approximately. Considering this is a Swiss portion which tends to be moderate, and slight uncertainty in thickness, a medium portion estimate around 130-140 grams feels reasonable.

The jar appears to be a small glass jar roughly 10 cm tall, commonly used for single servings. The parmesan layer is thin but visible on top and interspersed inside, likely around 5-7 grams given the light, fluffy nature of grated cheese. Considering Swiss portion sizes are smaller than US and the parmesan is a garnish rather than a main volume food, a medium portion estimate is about 6 grams.

Step 2: Dimension-wise, each petit pain au chocolat appears about 6-7 cm in diameter and has a typical thickness of about 3-4 cm based on the puffiness of the dough and chocolate. The granite surface gives a rough scale reference indicating standard size for small French pastries. Step 3: These are dense pastries with chocolate filling, so they are relatively heavy compared to simple bread rolls. Typically, a Swiss-sized petit pain au chocolat weighs less than larger bakery standards, but still roughly 50-60 grams each. Step 4: Given these are slightly rounded and compact three pastries without any extra size indications, I estimate each at about 55 grams. For three units, this totals approximately 165 grams.

The target food item is the 'sandwich chèvre figue' visible in the image as a baguette sandwich placed on a table. Step 1: The sandwich appears to be a single whole baguette, approximately 25-30 cm in length. Step 2: The baguette bread typical in Switzerland is denser and smaller compared to US bread portions. The baguette thickness is moderate and about 5 cm wide. Inside, visible ingredients include slices of goat cheese ('chèvre'), pieces of fig, and some lettuce. The goat cheese slices appear moderate in thickness and quantity, about 2-3 thin slices evenly distributed along the sandwich. The fig pieces are likely fig jam or fresh fig portions, though visible amount is small. Lettuce leaves add volume but very low density. Step 3: Considering density, goat cheese is dense and contributes significant weight; figs add moderate weight; lettuce is very light and can be mostly ignored for weight. Step 4: Typically, a baguette sandwich of this type in Swiss portion sizes weighs approximately 200-250 grams in total bread and filling. Since the filling appears moderately applied without excess, and the bread is typical size, I estimate the total weight of the sandwich filling (chèvre and fig plus lettuce) as roughly 80-100 grams, bread around 150 grams. Step 5: The question targets 'sandwich chèvre figue' which is the whole sandwich, so the whole sandwich weight is the target estimate. Considering all pieces, volume, and density, a reasonable estimate is approximately 230 grams total. Therefore, the 'sandwich chèvre figue' weighs about 230 grams.",13630.358012942064,52.90499801155127,19.850746268656717

The slice with nutella is half of a medium-sized slice of bread spread evenly with a generous but not very thick layer of nutella. Using the bread slice as reference dimensions (typical Swiss bread slice around 12x10 cm and about 2 cm thick), the volume of nutella spread is roughly a thin layer around 1-2 mm thick covering about half the slice's surface. Nutella has a density close to 1.2 g/cm³. Estimating the spread area as approximately 60 cm² and an average thickness of 0.15 cm gives a volume of about 9 cm³. Multiplying by density, the nutella weight is about 11 grams. Given the portion appears moderate (not sparse, not thick), a reasonable estimate is around 10-12 grams.

The apple provides a good reference: a small-to-medium apple weighs about 150-180 grams, and visually the croissant is slightly larger in volume but less dense than the apple. Considering the typical density and flakiness of croissants, which are light and airy despite their volume, and given that Swiss croissants tend to be slightly smaller and less heavy, an estimated range would be about 50-70 grams.

For Step 1, the pasta pieces can be counted roughly, about 10-12 pieces visible, plus some scattered vegetables. Step 2, using the plate as a size reference, the pasta pieces are typical penne size, about 4 cm long each, and appear to be cooked, thus denser and heavier than dry pasta. The total volume of the pile is quite small, roughly equivalent to a few tablespoons or about a quarter cup. Step 3, considering density, cooked pasta is dense and compact, meaning weight is significant for its visual size. Corn and tomato add little extra weight but must be considered. Step 4, for portion size calibration, this is a very small leftover portion, much less than a standard side portion of pasta salad which would be around 150-180 g. Given the amount visible, the estimation falls into a small portion range of approximately 50-70 grams. Step 5, cross-validating to avoid underestimation considering the density of cooked pasta, and the visible volume, the safest estimate is in the middle of the small portion range around 60 grams.

Comparing it to the length of the fries and the size of the plate, it is a small piece rather than a full chicken breast. Given the typical density of cooked chicken breast (approximately 1.0-1.1 g/cm³) and small size, this piece should weigh substantially less than a full portion. Estimating its volume roughly as 8 cm x 3 cm x 1 cm = 24 cm³, this corresponds to about 24 grams.

Approximately 120-160 grams would be a typical small to medium fresh peach; here, the volume appears slightly less than half a peach. Step 5: Cross validation checks for typical errors; the diced form and visible skin included support no under- or overestimation. Thus, estimating the weight of the collected diced peach in this bowl is about 80 grams.",15206.254305648277,59.02169649833133,24.328358208955223

The image shows three triangular slices of focaccia placed on a white plate. The slices appear thin and crisp, typical of Italian focaccia rather than the thicker variant. Each slice is roughly the size of a quarter of the plate, indicating the original focaccia piece was about a medium-sized portion, approximately 15-18 cm in diameter. Focaccia dough is relatively dense but light due to air bubbles. The thickness is around 0.5 to 1 cm. Considering this and the typical density of baked focaccia, each slice likely weighs between 35 g and 50 g. With three slices visible that do not cover the entire focaccia, but likely the full original piece, combining these gives a weight around 110-140 grams total.

Step 2: Using the plate and the size of the onions for reference, the total visible volume of tomatoes covers about half of the bowl's surface area. Considering the density of fresh tomatoes, which is fairly high but lighter than cooked vegetables, and accounting for the rough cut and some fluid content, I estimate a shallow depth of around 2-3 cm of tomato pieces in that area. Step 3: Estimating volume roughly as a semi-cylindrical pile about 10 cm diameter and 2-3 cm high gives approximately 150-200 ml in volume. Since fresh tomatoes have a density close to water (~1 g/ml), this corresponds closely to weight in grams. Step 4: Considering possible empty spaces and the mixed onions, I reduce this slightly to account only for tomatoes, estimating about 130-150 grams total tomatoes visible.

French fries are relatively dense compared to leafy vegetables but lighter than cooked meat. Given the size of the fries and typical Swiss portion sizes which tend to be smaller than US portions, this looks like a medium portion. A small portion would be around 80g, medium around 120g, and large around 160g. Considering the visual volume, depth, and the density, the portion here is slightly more than small but not very large. I estimate the weight of the fries to be approximately 110 grams.",16202.562854400809,62.88877774011502,27.46268656716418

Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The apple halves appear to be medium-sized, approximately 7-8 cm in diameter each, with a typical thickness for apple halves of about 2-3 cm. The plate is standard size, helping gauge size accurately. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cooked apples shrink slightly but retain most of their density. They are mostly water, making them moderately dense but lighter than raw apples by weight. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - A medium raw apple generally weighs around 150-180 grams. Considering cooking shrinkage, the weight is slightly reduced but both halves together still represent approximately 130-150 grams total. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Given the visual volume and standard portion sizes in a Swiss context, and the lack of visible peel and core in the halves, estimating 140 grams total is reasonable and conservative. Therefore, the combined weight of these two halves of cooked apple (pommes) is approximately 140 grams.",16294.562854400809,63.24586739340521,27.761194029850746

Visually, the cereals cover the bottom of the bowl but do not fill it deeply, with milk surrounding them and partially submerging some clusters. The bowl seems medium-sized, around 15 cm in diameter. Considering the visible amount of cereal clusters and the typical density of granola-type cereals, the depth of cereal in the bowl is roughly 1 to 1.5 cm. This would correspond to a modest portion. Since granola and oat clusters are quite dense and heavy relative to their volume, I estimate the cereal weight alone to be around 30 to 40 grams. This accounts for the medium portion size typical in Swiss contexts and the visual spread and clumping shown. Hence, the best estimate is 35 grams.",17223.003844400402,66.84952686318087,30.895522388059703

STEP 2: Dimension Analysis - Each blueberry appears typical in size, about 1.5 to 2 cm diameter, and the pile is about one layer thick with some slight stacking, indicating a near single-layer pile. STEP 3: Density Considerations - Blueberries are relatively dense fruits with skins included in weight. A medium blueberry typically weighs about 1.2 grams. STEP 4: Portion size calibration - A cluster of 35 blueberries at 1.2 grams each yields about 42 grams. Given the visible count and no heavy stacking, the portion is medium-sized.

Each croissant is approximately 6-7 cm long, about 3-4 cm wide, and has a moderate thickness given the filling, making their volume smaller than regular croissants but a bit denser due to cheese filling. Step 3: Density Considerations note that croissants are typically flaky and light, but the fresh cheese filling adds some density and weight. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration estimates an individual mini croissant au fromage frais between 35-50 grams depending on filling amount. Given the relatively small size and moderate visible filling, a reasonable single croissant weight is around 40 grams. Four croissants combined weigh about 160 grams, but since the target is only for one croissant au fromage frais, the estimate is 40 grams.

Typically, a small slice of whole grain or brown bread in Swiss portions weighs around 25-30 grams, but since these are broken pieces and not an entire slice, each piece is likely about half that weight or slightly less. Considering both pieces together, the total amount appears to be around one typical small Swiss bread slice portion or slightly less. The peanut butter is present on top, but since we are only estimating the weight of the bread, we exclude the peanut butter mass. Based on these observations and the visual scale of the pieces on the table, I estimate the combined weight of the bread pieces to be approximately 20 grams.",18093.059320759945,70.22656825879461,34.02985074626866

The rice grains look cooked and fluffy but compacted into a small mound roughly 8 cm in diameter and about 1.5 cm in height. Cooked white rice density is approximately 130 grams per 100 ml, and this portion visually corresponds to about 100-120 ml in volume considering some compaction. Taking into account the Swiss portion size typically being smaller than US servings, the rice portion weighs approximately between 120 and 140 grams. I estimate the rice weight to be about 130 grams, a reasonable medium portion based on the visual evidence without overestimating the depth or volume.",18952.406164058775,73.56204506672509,37.3134328358209

Comparing the size to the two fried eggs on the plate and the rice portion, the ratatouille depth likely extends about 2-3 cm given the typical serving style. Cooked vegetables like ratatouille maintain a moderate density, neither very light nor overly dense. A typical Swiss portion of ratatouille is smaller than American portions, so I'd expect a medium portion weight here.

The filling looks creamy and dense, occupying the full depth of the tart shell, which I estimate to be about 2 cm deep. This thickness accounts for both the lemon curd filling and the pastry base. Given the density of the pastry crust and the creamy lemon filling, typical weights for small lemon tartlets in a Swiss context range from 80 to 110 grams. Considering this tartlet's compact size, I estimate it at a medium portion size within that range.

Since only half an apple is present, the weight should be roughly half of that. The apple looks fresh and dense, and the seeds and core are visible, indicating the weight includes these parts. Based on these observations and using Swiss portion norms, I estimate the weight of this apple half at about 90 grams.",19745.722529204886,76.64123056432794,40.59701492537314

The target food is 'pain libanais'. The image shows a small piece of Lebanese flatbread broken off from a larger piece. The flatbread piece covers about one-third to one-half of a small dessert-sized plate (approximately 20 cm diameter). Lebanese flatbread is thin and relatively light, typically weighing about 150-180 grams for a whole 25-28 cm diameter round. Given that this piece looks like roughly one-quarter to one-third of a full flatbread based on area and thickness, and considering it is thin and porous, the weight should be proportionally less. Estimating conservatively, the piece shown likely weighs between 40 and 55 grams. Since it's a smaller portion on a Swiss context, I select an estimated weight near the middle of that range, about 48 grams.",19780.573593034675,76.77650180671678,40.74626865671642

The pasta is of the fusilli type, cooked and dressed with some tomato sauce which adds a bit of moisture and weight. The portion of pasta covers roughly half of the container's right side and appears to be about 2-3 cm deep, allowing for some hidden volume beneath the surface. Comparing the pasta portion to the size of the chicken strips and the container, the portion size looks medium. Considering typical cooked pasta density (~140-160 g per cup/200 ml), and the estimated volume about 1 to 1.5 cups, the weight range is approximately 140-240 grams. Given the visible portion size leans towards medium, a mid-range estimate of about 190 grams is appropriate.",19815.368982083666,76.91155695249508,40.8955223880597

The confiture layer is spread thinly but evenly, and from the shine and texture, it seems to be about 2-3 mm thick. Given that fruit jam has a density similar to water but slightly thicker due to sugar content, we estimate about 0.9-1.1 g/cm3. The surface area covered by the confiture is approximately 70 cm2, and with a thickness of about 0.25 cm, this results in a volume of around 17.5 cm3.

The target food item is 'panais' (parsnip), visible as light beige, irregular, elongated chunks mixed with other vegetables and feta on a plate. Step 1: Visual Identification - I see about 4 to 5 pieces of parsnip mixed in the portion, interspersed with carrots, potatoes, beetroot, aubergine, and feta. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each parsnip piece is roughly the size of a sliced carrot piece, about 3-5 cm in length and 1.5-2.5 cm thick. The pieces appear roasted, so less volume shrinkage but similar density to cooked parsnip. Step 3: Density Considerations - Parsnip is a dense root vegetable, similar to carrots or potatoes but slightly more dense. Cooked root vegetables usually weigh around 0.8-1.0 g per cm3. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given the number of pieces and their size, the parsnip portion looks medium-sized on a Swiss plate. Estimating average piece weight about 20 grams (considering size and density), with 4-5 pieces total, resulting in approximately 80-100 grams total. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The total mixed portion does not seem large, and the parsnip proportion is moderate, so choosing middle value near 90 grams is reasonable and consistent with the visual volume and density. Therefore, the estimated weight of the parsnip portion is about 90 grams.",19953.235775006233,77.44667440124452,41.492537313432834

Considering the size relative to the avocado slice and bread piece, each piece of chicken is estimated to weigh around 15 grams on average. Each skewer has about 4-5 pieces, so approximately 60-75 grams per skewer. Since the input specifies 'poulet' for estimation, I assume it's the first skewer with the darker grilled chicken on the left (not the lighter second skewer). Thus, the estimated weight for the first 'poulet' skewer is about 70 grams, considering some variability and being conservative. No container weight is included, and Swiss portion sizes tend to be moderate, so this estimate fits well.",20443.502260122557,79.34959928374444,43.73134328358209

The image shows a plate with three food portions: white basmati rice, small pieces of cooked chicken with sauce, and a gratin dish with béchamel sauce. Focusing only on the 'riz basmati' (basmati rice), it appears as a pile occupying roughly a third of the plate's diameter. Given that Swiss portions are generally smaller than US servings, this looks like a moderate portion. Considering the size of individual grains visible and the compactness of the rice pile, I estimate the rice's volume to be about 150-180 ml. Cooked basmati rice has a typical density of about 0.9 grams per ml. Multiplying the volume by density gives a weight range of approximately 135-162 grams. Considering this visual evidence, the portion seems closer to medium size; therefore, I estimate the basmati rice portion on the plate to weigh approximately 150 grams.",20474.63942826415,79.47045537696312,43.88059701492537

The image shows a single whole greenish-yellow apple placed on a desk, providing size context with visible cables and a USB plug nearby. The apple appears medium-sized typical for Swiss portions, with an approximate diameter between 7-8 cm. Standard medium apples in Switzerland weigh around 150 to 180 grams. The apple appears dense and fresh, so I will use the mid-range of this weight estimate. Since there is only one apple and it is fully visible with no parts missing, the estimated weight is around 160 grams.",20505.63942826415,79.59077906448482,44.02985074626866

The image shows two slices of rustic bread ('pain') on a standard white plate. Each slice is roughly the size of a typical slice of country bread, about 10 cm wide and 7-8 cm tall, with a thickness around 1.5 cm. The bread has a light, aerated crumb with a crust on the outside. Considering Swiss portion sizes, a slice of rustic bread like this generally weighs between 40 and 55 grams depending on density and thickness. Both slices are similar in size, and the target is to estimate one slice's weight. Given the visible volume and typical moisture content of rustic bread, I estimate the weight of one slice of this 'pain' to be approximately 50 grams.",20536.63942826415,79.71110275200651,44.17910447761194

The kiwi is visible as thin slices embedded inside the glass, with several pieces stacked around the edges. Counting the slices, there appear to be about 4 to 5 thin kiwi slices visible. Each slice is roughly 0.5-0.7 mm thick and about 4-5 cm in diameter, which matches a typical kiwi slice thickness and size. Considering the kiwi is relatively light and watery but dense enough due to its flesh, fresh kiwi usually weighs about 40-50 grams in total for a typical small to medium fruit. Given the visible slices correspond roughly to half a small kiwi fruit, I estimate the weight of the kiwi portion here to be around 30 grams, factoring in the thin slices and some hidden slices inside the glass volume.",20567.577572594044,79.83118635235655,44.32835820895522

The image shows two small rectangular pieces of sweet potato waffle ('gaufre à la patate douce') on a plate. Each piece is topped with a slice of smoked salmon and a dollop of demi crème acidulée sauce, but we focus only on the waffles. The waffles appear to be about 8-10 cm in length and roughly 5 cm in width, with a thickness around 1.5-2 cm estimated from the visible edges. Sweet potato waffles are denser than typical wheat waffles but still somewhat aerated. Assuming a density similar to cooked sweet potato plus waffle batter, a piece of this size would weigh approximately 45-55 grams. With two pieces visible, the total waffle weight sums around 90-110 grams. Considering the portions look medium in size, I place the estimate towards the middle of this range at about 100 grams.",20598.46298926071,79.95106529506552,44.47761194029851
