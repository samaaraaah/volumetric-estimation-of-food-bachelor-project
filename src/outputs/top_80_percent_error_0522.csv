The target food item is 'pain aux noix', which is the slice of walnut bread visible on the edge of the black plate. The slice appears to be about average thickness, around 2 cm, and roughly half of a typical small bread roll size, judging by the spoon and plate size. Walnut bread tends to be moderately dense due to the nuts and wholegrain content. A typical slice of this size in Swiss portion context weighs between 40 and 60 grams. Taking into account the density and visible size of this slice, with the nuts visible in the bread, I estimate the weight of this 'pain aux noix' slice to be around 50 grams.",230.544061302682,2.559912078520651,0.4694835680751174

The slice is roughly one eighth of a small to medium pizza, typically about 20 cm long and 10 cm wide at the crust. The crust is moderately thick and the amount of cheese and vegetables is moderate but spread unevenly. Considering the density of cooked vegetables and cheese, plus the dough crust, a full small pizza would weigh approximately 500-600 grams. Therefore, this single slice should weigh between 60-75 grams.

The jar is roughly the size of a standard jam jar, about 7cm wide at the top as indicated by the lid diameter marking. The porridge fills about 70-80% of the jar's volume. Assuming the jar is about 8-9cm tall and cylindrical, the total volume of the jar is around 300 ml. Given the porridge density is close to that of cooked oats (about 1 g/ml), this indicates the porridge inside weighs nearly as much as its volume in grams.

The container diameter is approximately 8-9 cm, typical for single-serve desserts. The tiramisu appears to be filled to about 4-5 cm depth. Given the structure of tiramisu, layers include mascarpone cream, soaked ladyfingers, and cocoa powder topping, which contribute moderate density but some airy texture from the cream. Taking the volume roughly as a cylinder (8.5 cm diameter × 4.5 cm height), the approximate volume is around 255 cm³.

The pasta forms a visible layer covering most of a standard rectangular plate (approximately 20-25 cm long). The portion looks fairly thick, about 2-3 cm deep, as the pasta is piled slightly but not too much. Compared to the size of the plate and considering the Swiss portion context, this is a medium-sized serving of pasta. Cooked pasta is dense and compact, so the weight is higher than it looks for the volume.

The filling is dense with cooked spinach and egg custard, which are fairly dense ingredients, plus a layer of melted cheese which adds weight. The crust is also visible with a standard thickness. Considering the density of cooked spinach mixed with eggs and cheese, and the standard thickness of the crust, each slice likely weighs between 80-100 grams.

Visually, the salade verte occupies roughly one quarter of a small to medium-sized plate, next to the larger portion of potato salad and a smaller portion of cottage cheese. The lettuce leaves are loose with some volume but low density since lettuce is light and mostly air. Comparing to the knife size and the plate diameter (roughly 22-24 cm), the pile of leaves looks to have a surface area of about 10x7 cm and a depth around 2-3 cm, so the volume is moderate but the density is low. Given the nature of salad leaves, the density is about 0.15-0.2 g/cm3. Estimating volume at approximately 140-160 cm3 and multiplying by density, I get a weight range around 21-32 grams. Considering this is a fairly typical Swiss portion size and the salad is not overly packed, I estimate a medium serving weight of 27 grams for the salade verte.",1849.1673193064485,20.53275946103567,5.164319248826291

The toppings (champignons, olives, courgettes) proportionally cover the pizza surface but are light compared to the dough and cheese. Visually estimating, the vegetable toppings represent approximately 15-20% of the total pizza weight. Taking a 325 gram total pizza as a reference, 20% corresponds to about 65 grams total vegetable toppings. Since five slices are present, the toppings on the visible pizza amount to approximately 54 grams. This aligns with the visual coverage and density: mushrooms and courgettes are moderately dense, olives smaller but dense too. Therefore, the total weight of the pizza champignons, olives, courgettes visible on the plate is estimated at 54 grams.",1978.1673193064485,21.965147943580902,5.633802816901408

Step 2: Compared to the plate (standard medium-sized dinner plate around 25-27 cm diameter), the salad takes up roughly one-third of the plate area. The greens are loosely piled, so depth is around 3-4 cm at maximum. Step 3: The salad greens are very light, with low density. The tomatoes have moderate density. Step 4: Estimating typical Swiss salad mixed portions, a small to medium salad plate serving is around 50 to 90 grams. Given the volume and leafy nature, I'd place this as a medium portion, closer to 70-80 grams. Step 5: Cross-validating, salads tend to be underestimated if only volume is considered but given the visible size and number of leaves, 75 grams is a reasonable estimate.

Considering the orecchiette pasta shape, the pieces are fairly dense and layered with tomato-based sauce, cheese, and possibly some vegetables. The gratin is piled with some depth, visible as roughly 2-3 cm thick, and appears compact, not loose. Cooked pasta gratins are heavy due to the moisture and cheese content. Based on typical Swiss portion sizes and the visible volume, a small to medium portion weight is expected. A small portion of gratin might be around 120g, while a larger portion could be 180-200g.

Step 2: Dimension analysis uses the bowl as a reference, which seems to be a standard small-medium kitchen bowl (~15 cm diameter, ~6-7 cm depth). The dahl de lentille appears to fill approximately 60-70% of the bowl's volume, roughly about 280-320 ml in volume, assuming the dahl is somewhat thick. Step 3: Density consideration notes that dahl de lentille, a cooked legume dish with vegetables, is relatively dense and moist with a density estimated near 1 g/ml. Step 4: Portion size calibration accounts for a medium Swiss portion, leading to an estimated range of 260-320 grams.

Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Cherry tomatoes generally measure about 2.5 to 3 cm in diameter. Using the plate as a reference, these tomatoes fit that expected size range. Step 3: Density Considerations - Tomatoes are dense with high water content but not heavy; an average cherry tomato weighs roughly between 15 and 20 grams. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Since all are relatively uniform in size and quantity, the total weight is approximated by multiplying count by average weight. Assuming an average weight per tomato of about 16 grams (mid-range for small Swiss portion cherry tomatoes), 27 tomatoes × 16 grams = 432 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The total seems reasonable given the size and that the tomatoes fill roughly half a medium plate.

The portion roughly covers about one third of the plate surface. Based on the plate diameter being a standard small dinner plate (around 22 cm), the blé aux légumes portion is approximately 10 cm by 7 cm in visible area, with an estimated depth of about 2.5 cm considering the moisture and volume of cooked grains with vegetables. Cooked wheat berries have a density similar to cooked grains, reasonably dense and compact. Vegetables and sauce add some volume without much density. Estimating volume around 175 cm3 and considering a density close to 1 g/cm3 for cooked grains with vegetables, the portion likely weighs around 170-190 grams.

The noodles are partially covered by the other ingredients but visible around the edges and underneath. The noodles appear to be slender, flat rice noodles that are typical in Thai cuisine. Given the size of the bowl (medium-sized bowl), and the visible volume of noodles suggesting a layer of about 1.5 - 2 cm depth underneath the toppings, the rice noodles portion likely corresponds to a single serving. Noodles are dense but lightweight compared to meat and vegetables due to their structure. Visual volume alone suggests a medium Swiss portion size, smaller than US portions. An average cooked rice noodle portion in Switzerland is between 90 to 120 grams.

The target food item is 'poulet + sauce curry,' which is clearly visible as two chicken strips covered in a yellow curry sauce lying on top of rice. For visual identification, I can see two sizeable pieces of chicken breast or tenderloin. They appear evenly coated with curry sauce. Comparing the chicken strips to the standard width and height of the rectangular glass container, which is likely around 15 cm in length and about 6-7 cm in width, each chicken strip seems to be approximately 12 cm long, 3 cm wide, and about 1.5-2 cm thick including sauce. This gives a moderate volume. The sauce adds some slight volume but is mostly on the surface and does not greatly increase weight beyond the chicken itself. Considering density, cooked chicken breast without bone usually weighs around 1.05 g/cm3. Given the relatively dense composition and compact shape, I approximate each strip’s weight around 70-90 grams with sauce. Two strips hence fall in the range of approximately 140-180 grams. Given the portion looks like a standard medium, not overly large nor very small, a midrange estimate is appropriate. Therefore, I estimate the 'poulet + sauce curry' weight as approximately 160 grams, excluding any container weight.",3252.753981817571,36.117886357431296,11.267605633802816

The tart has a relatively thin crust and a dense spinach and egg filling with visible cheese or browned topping. Considering the thickness is about 1.5 to 2 cm, and the filling density is fairly compact given the cooked spinach and egg custard, this type of tart usually weighs around 80 to 100 grams per eighth slice in Swiss portions, which are typically smaller than US portions. Given two slices are on the plate, I estimate the combined weight is roughly 160 to 200 grams.

Visually, the spinach covers the entire base of the bowl, with leaves overlapping and some partially covered by falafels and tomatoes. Fresh spinach leaves are relatively light and leafy, but here the portion looks moderately dense and compact given the bowl size, which is about the size of a small to medium salad bowl (approx. 18 cm width). The volume of spinach here looks like roughly 1 to 1.5 handfuls, typical for a small Swiss portion. Given typical fresh spinach density (~30 g per 100 ml volume), and estimating a compact volume of about 120-150 ml of leaves, the fresh spinach weight is likely between 35 and 45 grams.

The target food item is 'haricots coco,' which are visible in the upper left part of the plate. They appear as chopped flat green bean pieces, likely cooked, and arranged in a small pile. I counted approximately 15 pieces of cut haricots coco. Each piece looks roughly 3-5 cm long and about 1-2 cm wide, with a thickness typical of cooked flat beans, around 0.5-1 cm. Considering their cooked state, they retain some moisture but are still relatively light. Comparing their size to the plate (standard small Swiss dinner plate about 22 cm diameter) and the curry rice portion, the beans occupy about one quarter of the plate's visible area and have moderate thickness, giving a volume estimation of about 120-150 ml. Given the density of cooked green beans (around 0.6-0.7 g/ml), the total weight is likely between 75 and 105 grams. Considering this portion is moderate in size and not heaped, I estimate the total weight of the haricots coco at approximately 90 grams.",4521.11483378664,50.20149469907281,19.248826291079812

The target food is 'poulet au curry', which is located in the right compartment of the black container. Visually, there are about 5 to 6 pieces of chicken coated in a thick curry sauce. The pieces vary in size, with some larger chunks around 5-6 cm in length and others smaller, possibly closer to 3-4 cm. The depth of the curry sauce suggests some chicken pieces may be partially submerged, indicating more volume than a flat surface suggests. Considering chicken's density (dense meat), and that the sauce adds weight but does not count as a separate food item, we focus only on the chicken pieces. Given Swiss portion sizes are generally smaller than US portions, this looks like a medium portion. A single medium chicken breast piece with sauce can weigh around 40-50 grams. Multiplying by the approximate visible pieces (5), this suggests a range of 200-250 grams total. Factoring a slight reduction for sauce volume and possible partial hiding, I estimate the weight of the chicken pieces themselves to be about 220 grams.",4583.853151543649,50.898127596510044,19.718309859154928

The target food item is 'mélange de légumes' visible on the plate as a cooked vegetable mix primarily consisting of diced zucchini and yellow bell pepper pieces. The portion is roughly a small pile located on the left side of the plate. The vegetables appear cooked, which means some moisture loss but retention of density. The pile is about 6 cm by 5 cm on the plate surface and roughly 2 cm thick given the layering. Given that cooked vegetables have moderate density, I estimate the volume to be roughly 60 cubic centimeters. Assuming vegetable density close to 0.8 g/cm3, this results in about 48 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes are modest and the pile looks small to medium, I place the weight around the middle of the range, close to 50 grams.

They form a small pile, but not very thick—roughly 1 to 2 beans thick in some spots, so some volume is hidden underneath. Considering green beans are relatively dense for vegetables but still quite light, the total volume is moderate. Visually, this appears to be a small to medium portion in Swiss context, smaller than US portions. Typical cooked green beans weigh about 20-25 grams per handful of this size.

Visually, the pasta portion occupies roughly half of the plate, with penne pasta clearly visible coated with a creamy yellow sauce, indicative of the saffron demi-cream sauce. The pasta pieces are well cooked and densely packed, showing some layering and overlap, suggesting a moderate to substantial depth. Comparing the pasta to the brochettes of sausages on the same plate, which appear smaller and denser, the pasta portion looks like a medium serving common in Swiss context, smaller than typical US portions. Estimating volume based on plate size (standard dinner plate of about 25-27cm diameter), the pasta mound is around 10cm by 6cm in surface area and about 2-3cm deep on average. Cooked pasta with sauce generally has a density around 0.9-1.1 g/cm3 due to sauce moisture. Using a conservative approach balanced for sauce density and visual fullness, a medium portion in this size range weighs approximately 140-170 grams. Selecting a midpoint, the estimated weight for the pasta with demi-cream and saffron sauce is about 155 grams.",4823.944216714859,53.56404756948103,21.5962441314554

The image shows a single sandwich au fromage made with a seeded baguette-style bread roll, approximately 20-22 cm in length, typical of smaller Swiss portions. The bread is dense with a thick crust and a soft interior. The sandwich contains about 4-5 slices of semi-hard cheese, visible with some overlapping, each roughly 1-2 mm thick, plus a few leaves of lettuce. The cheese is denser than bread and leafy greens, so the cheese slices alone likely weigh around 40-50 grams in total. The baguette, considering its size and density, is estimated to weigh between 120-140 grams. Lettuce adds negligible weight, about 5 grams. Summing these estimates and considering the portion as medium-sized, the total weight of the sandwich au fromage (focusing only on the cheese inside) is about 45 grams of cheese. Since the prompt asks specifically for the weight of 'sandwich au fromage' as a whole food item, standard practice is to include the whole sandwich without container but taking everything inside (bread and filling). Therefore, combined the sandwich weighs approximately 165 grams. This reflects a typical medium-sized Swiss cheese sandwich with seeded bread. The main visual cue is the substantial bread size and visible cheese quantity.",4882.944216714859,54.219170983978465,22.065727699530516

The image shows three pieces of bread on a small white plate. Two pieces have a pale yellow spread identified as honey ('miel'), and the third piece has a red spread (likely raspberry jam). The honey appears lightly spread, covering about half the surface area of two pieces of bread. Each bread piece looks like a small roll, roughly 7 cm in diameter, with a moderate thickness. A typical slice of such bread weighs around 30-35g. Honey is dense and sticky, so even a small layer adds some weight. Considering the visible area covered and average spread thickness (~2-3 mm), the honey volume approximates to about 5 grams per piece. Since two pieces are visible with honey, total honey weight is about 10 grams. There is no honey visible on the third piece. Following Swiss portion sizes, this is a reasonable, medium honey amount on bread. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of honey ('miel') to be approximately 10 grams.",4941.300237657268,54.867143792389896,22.535211267605632

Visually, the jar is small and filled just over halfway, and the peppers are diced small but visible in several pieces dispersed throughout the content. Considering the jar size (comparable to a small jam jar of about 200-250 ml volume) and the fact that peppers are mixed but not the dominant ingredient, the peppers likely weigh less than the pasta or sauce. Red and yellow bell peppers cooked slightly hold density close to fresh peppers, which have a density of about 0.9 g/cm³. The pieces visible suggest roughly 30-40 grams of peppers, factoring depth and volume distribution inside the jar. I estimate the poivrons weight between 30 and 40 grams, leaning toward a medium portion due to the visible quantity and typical Swiss serving size.

Step 2: Dimension-wise, each petit pain au chocolat appears about 6-7 cm in diameter and has a typical thickness of about 3-4 cm based on the puffiness of the dough and chocolate. The granite surface gives a rough scale reference indicating standard size for small French pastries. Step 3: These are dense pastries with chocolate filling, so they are relatively heavy compared to simple bread rolls. Typically, a Swiss-sized petit pain au chocolat weighs less than larger bakery standards, but still roughly 50-60 grams each. Step 4: Given these are slightly rounded and compact three pastries without any extra size indications, I estimate each at about 55 grams. For three units, this totals approximately 165 grams.

Step 2, using the plate as a size reference, the pasta pieces are typical penne size, about 4 cm long each, and appear to be cooked, thus denser and heavier than dry pasta. The total volume of the pile is quite small, roughly equivalent to a few tablespoons or about a quarter cup. Step 3, considering density, cooked pasta is dense and compact, meaning weight is significant for its visual size. Corn and tomato add little extra weight but must be considered. Step 4, for portion size calibration, this is a very small leftover portion, much less than a standard side portion of pasta salad which would be around 150-180 g. Given the amount visible, the estimation falls into a small portion range of approximately 50-70 grams.

The butter is visible as small patches spread thinly on the surface of both slices. The areas covered are uneven but overall thin and not heavily layered. Considering the Swiss portions which tend to be smaller, a typical thin spread of butter on one slice is about 5-7 grams. Here, since the butter is patchy and not fully covering the bread, I estimate approximately 6 grams total butter across both slices. Butter is dense and heavy for its size, so even the small visible portions correspond to this weight.

Step 1: I identify approximately 6-7 large flat beans that are notable for their length and width, partially folded but fully occupying about half of the bowl’s surface area. Step 2: By comparing to the bowl size (roughly a medium-sized soup bowl) and the other food items, I estimate each bean to be around 12-15 cm long and about 3-4 cm wide, with a thickness of approximately 0.5-1 cm given their flat but fleshy nature. Step 3: Considering density, green beans are fairly dense cooked vegetables, so their weight is fairly concentrated in a small volume. Step 4: For 6-7 beans with this size, I calculate a total estimated weight range of roughly 100 to 140 grams, treating this as a medium portion. Step 5: Cross-validating with typical Swiss portion sizes for similar cooked green beans, which tend to be smaller portions than US sizes, I select a weight near the middle of this range.

The image shows a small glass serving of panna cotta topped with a raspberry sauce and one whole raspberry. The glass appears to be roughly the size of a small espresso or dessert glass, approximately 6-7 cm tall and 5-6 cm in diameter. The panna cotta portion is the creamy white layer in the bottom half to two thirds of the glass, while the raspberry topping occupies the top third. Considering typical panna cotta density as a creamy, dense gelatin dessert, and the volume estimated visually as about 100-120 ml total, the panna cotta (excluding the raspberry topping weight) should be in the range of 90-110 grams. The raspberry topping is relatively thin, so it weighs less and is excluded from this estimation. Therefore, the panna cotta portion itself is conservatively estimated at about 100 grams, fitting a typical Swiss portion, smaller than US dessert servings.",6609.6113524781,73.39171453790587,38.967136150234744

The target food item is ratatouille, located on the right side of the plate. It is a mixture of cooked vegetables including zucchini, eggplant, and tomatoes. The vegetables appear diced into roughly 1-2 cm pieces. Visually, the ratatouille occupies a compact but modest volume on the plate, roughly the size of a medium scoop, about 8 cm by 6 cm in surface area with an estimated depth of about 2.5 cm, taking into account the typical stewed vegetable layering and some hidden depth that isn't obvious from the top view. Such cooked vegetables have fairly dense moisture content, so weight per volume is fairly substantial. Considering the Swiss portion context, which is typically smaller than US portions, I estimate the weight range to be approximately 110-140 grams. Choosing a medium portion size based on visual evidence (not overly heaping but a decent portion), an estimate near the middle of this range is appropriate. Therefore, I estimate the ratatouille to weigh approximately 125 grams.",6650.439635306383,73.84506308120301,39.436619718309856

Each loaf is about the size of a small palm, approximately 7-8 cm in diameter, with a slightly rustic crust and visible walnut pieces. Swiss bread portions tend to be smaller than in some other countries. Given their size and typical density for bread with nuts, each loaf likely weighs around 70-90 grams. Since the request is to estimate for 'pains aux noix' (plural), but does not specify how many loaves to estimate, the safe assumption is to estimate for one piece. Taking a medium portion size in this range, the estimated weight for one 'pain aux noix' is about 80 grams.",6690.570587687335,74.29066861596306,39.906103286384976

Considering the visible dimensions and the known average density of apples, which are predominantly water and fibrous material, the weight is expected to be moderate. Swiss medium apples typically weigh between 130 and 180 grams. This apple does not appear unusually large or small, so placing it near the median of this range is appropriate.

The image shows a small glass jar containing a caramel beurre salé yogurt. The jar size appears similar to typical Swiss small dessert jars, roughly 6-7 cm in height and about 5 cm in diameter. The yogurt fills around 80% of the jar's height. Given the jar size and typical density of yogurt (close to water but slightly thicker), the total volume here is approximately 150-180 ml. Since 1 ml ~ 1 gram for yogurt, and accounting for the caramel layer inside, the total weight should be slightly less than the full volume. Considering a standard portion size for such a dessert in Switzerland is usually around 120-150 grams per jar, and this portion seems a medium one (not very full, not too empty), an estimate near the mid-range is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'yogourt caramel beurre salé' in this jar to be approximately 140 grams.",6770.570587687335,75.17897155087483,40.84507042253521

Visually, the biscuit is roughly the size of a small cookie with a diameter approximately between 6 to 7 centimeters, based on the texture of the wooden table as a scale reference. The biscuit appears to be dense, as it has both a glaze layer and jam filling, and its thickness looks around 0.8 to 1 cm. Considering similar types of jam-filled biscuits common in Swiss and European snacks, the average weight for such a biscuit typically ranges between 30 to 40 grams.

The target food is 'confiture fraise' (strawberry jam) spread on three slices of bread. Visually, the jam is thinly spread with some small dollops on the surface of the bread. Considering a typical Swiss context, jam spreads are not applied very thickly. The visible quantity on each slice appears to be roughly 5 to 7 grams. With three slices, the total spread looks like approximately 15 to 20 grams of jam in total. Being conservative and accounting for partial absorption into the bread without visible pooling, I estimate the total weight of strawberry jam visible on the plate to be about 18 grams.",6850.357989262138,76.06491383822336,41.78403755868545

In the image, there are three bread rolls: two lighter brown ones that look like brioche au chocolat and one darker brown roll with visible walnut pieces, identified as the pain aux noix. The pain aux noix has a round shape with a rough surface and visible nuts embedded in the dough. Comparing its size to the brioche au chocolat pieces, it is roughly the same size as each brioche, about the size of a small bread roll usually served in Switzerland, which tends to be smaller than typical US rolls. Considering the density of a nut bread, which is denser than plain bread due to walnuts, and the visible volume, the estimated weight should reflect its compact form and added nuts. Small individual pain aux noix rolls typically weigh between 50 and 70 grams.
