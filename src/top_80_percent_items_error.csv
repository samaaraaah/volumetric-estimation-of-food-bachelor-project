The image shows a single nectarine placed on a wooden surface. The nectarine appears to be of average size, with a smooth skin and a round shape. Based on the visual comparison with the pencil in the background, the nectarine is approximately 6-7 cm in diameter. A typical nectarine of this size weighs around 130-150 grams. Given the visual cues and the average density of nectarines, I estimate the weight of this nectarine to be 140 grams.",31.811697539328303,79.52085118122208,22.214484679665738

The specified food item is 'fenouil farci avec sauce tomate'. In the image, the fennel stuffed with tomato sauce is located on the left side of the plate. It appears to consist of two medium-sized fennel halves, cooked and covered in a tomato-based sauce. Cooked fennel is relatively dense, and the sauce adds some additional weight. Based on the size and volume of the fennel halves and the visible amount of sauce, I estimate the total weight of the 'fenouil farci avec sauce tomate' to be approximately 150 grams.",31.845802896960873,79.60610557751542,22.284122562674096

The image shows a long sandwich on a baguette, filled with visible ingredients such as lettuce, goat cheese (chèvre), and fig spread. The baguette appears to be a standard size, approximately 30 cm in length, and is filled moderately with the ingredients. A typical baguette of this size weighs around 200-250 grams. Considering the visible fillings, which add additional weight (approximately 50-70 grams for the chèvre, fig spread, and lettuce combined), the total weight of the sandwich is estimated to be around 300 grams. This estimation accounts for the density and distribution of the fillings and the size of the bread.",31.947221460447196,79.85962522965089,22.493036211699163

The image shows a bowl containing pieces of pineapple (ananas). The pieces are triangular and appear to be medium-sized chunks. Based on the size of the bowl and the visible volume of the pineapple pieces, the total amount of pineapple seems to fill about half of the bowl. Pineapple is a dense fruit, and these pieces likely weigh around 10-15 grams each. There are approximately 12-14 pieces visible in the bowl. Estimating conservatively, the total weight of the pineapple pieces is around 150-200 grams. I will estimate the weight as 180 grams.",31.980462549757693,79.94271918315319,22.56267409470752
