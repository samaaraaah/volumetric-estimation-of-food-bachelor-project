The image shows a full pizza in a standard takeaway pizza box, which roughly measures about 30 cm in diameter, indicating a medium-sized pizza typical in Swiss servings (often smaller than US portions). The pizza is topped generously with cheese, tomato sauce, mushrooms, and slices of ham. The crust is thin to medium thickness, and the toppings cover most of the surface. The cheese layer is melted but not overly thick, and the ham slices are visible but not overly piled. Considering the density of cheese, ham, and veggies on a medium-sized thin-crust pizza, portion weights typically range from about 250 to 350 grams. This pizza looks like a full single pizza, no slices missing, and the toppings moderately thick but not overloaded. Estimating conservatively in the middle of the range due to the thin crust, I conclude the pizza weighs approximately 300 grams.",1.3702878111094916,2.5864903058601,0.072992700729927

The salad contains visible cubes of feta cheese, diced cucumbers, diced tomatoes, and pieces of black olives. The ingredients appear fresh and lightly mixed without excessive dressing. The portion nearly fills the plate, with pieces spanning an estimated 18 cm diameter. The salad has visible depth due to the layering of cubed vegetables and cheese, roughly around 3-4 cm thick considering the volume. Feta cheese is dense but only a part of the salad by volume, vegetables are less dense but compact. Typical Greek salad portion in Switzerland is smaller than US portions, and this seems to be a moderate portion.

The image shows a single serving placed on a standard-sized plate, approximately 22-24 cm in diameter. The lasagne portion covers roughly one-third of the plate's surface in length and width, appearing moderately thick with several visible layers. Based on the comparison with the plate, the piece is about 10 cm long and 7-8 cm wide, and visually around 2.5 to 3 cm thick. Eggplants and tomato sauce add moisture and density, while the pasta and cheese contribute to weight but less densely. Lasagne, especially vegetable-based like aubergine, tends to be dense due to layered composition and moisture content. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes which are smaller than US, this represents a medium serving. Estimating volume (10 x 7.5 x 2.5 cm = about 187.5 cm³) and applying a density approximation around 1.1 g/cm³ (accounting for moist vegetables and pasta), the weight would be roughly 200 grams.

The dessert piece is about the size of a palm or slightly smaller, roughly 8 cm by 8 cm on the plate, with a height estimated around 3 cm including the berries. The biscuit is dense but thin, the fruits rouges layer adds moisture and some weight, and the creamy séré+mascarpone layer is substantial and dense. Considering typical densities: biscuit (approx. 300 g/1000 cm3), fruits rouges (approx. 400 g/1000 cm3), and creamy mascarpone mixture (approx. 500 g/1000 cm3). By volume approximation: 8x8x3 = 192 cm3 total volume. Estimating breakdown: biscuit ~30% volume = 58 cm3, fruits rouges ~20% volume = 38 cm3, mascarpone+seré ~50% volume = 96 cm3. Calculating weights for these volumes: biscuit ~17 g, fruits rouges ~15 g, mascarpone ~48 g. Summing these gives approximately 80 grams total. Considering the visible moist consistency and slight compaction, correcting slightly upwards to 85 grams. The three raspberries on top contribute negligibly (~3-4 g) but are included visually here as part of the fruits rouges layer.

The image shows a small portion of risotto aux asperges (asparagus risotto) on a rectangular plate. Step 1: The risotto is visibly clumped into a compact mass with visible pieces of asparagus embedded within. There are no separate piles; the portion is a single heap about 7-8 cm wide and 5-6 cm deep visually. Step 2: Using the plate as a reference (typical small Swiss plate width is roughly 20 cm), the risotto portion occupies less than half the plate surface, suggesting a small to medium Swiss portion. The depth/thickness of the risotto appears to be around 1.5-2 cm. Step 3: Risotto is cooked rice and hence quite dense. Asparagus stalks are present, but visually sparse and embedded, contributing modestly to the total mass. Step 4: Estimating volume: approx 7 cm × 6 cm × 2 cm = around 84 cubic centimeters of food. Cooked rice density is about 1.3 g/cm3, so the rough weight estimate is 84 × 1.3 = approximately 109 grams. Adjusting slightly downward to account for some air space and vegetable content but conservative portion size, the estimate is about 100 grams. Step 5: Considering typical Swiss portion sizes and the visible amount, this aligns with a smaller portion rather than a large serving.

The potato salad consists of chopped boiled potatoes mixed with onion, herbs, and a light dressing. For visual scaling, the plate is a standard small lunch plate, approximately 23 cm diameter, and the potato salad portion covers about a third of the plate surface with a moderate thickness. The potatoes appear roughly 1-3 cm chunks, and the pile is thick enough to estimate density close to firm cooked potatoes with some dressing. Potato salad is dense, so it weighs more than it looks compared to loose leafy food. Given Swiss portion sizes, this looks like a medium serving.

It seems to cover approximately one-third of the plate, slightly piled but relatively thin in depth without excessive layering. Step 2 (Dimension Analysis): The plate is a standard medium-sized plate (about 24 cm diameter). The gratin section covers roughly a 9 cm by 9 cm area. The depth estimate, considering a gratin is somewhat dense but not thick, is around 1.5 to 2 cm. Step 3 (Density Considerations): Cooked vegetables with tomato sauce and melted cheese are moderately dense, so the estimated density is close to 0.9 to 1.1 g/cm3. Step 4 (Portion Size Calibration): Calculating volume as 9 cm x 9 cm x 2 cm = 162 cm3. Multiplying by average density (~1 g/cm3) gives around 160 grams. Considering some moisture loss and shrinkage typical for gratin vegetables and the moderate cheese presence, I set an internal range from 130 to 180 grams. Given portion size appears moderate, I estimate toward middle range about 150 grams. Step 5 (Cross-Validation): This matches expectations for a Swiss portion of gratin de légumes, not over-abundant but a full serving.

The image shows a bowl containing tomato soup ('soupe à la tomate') with visible tomato chunks and a liquid broth. Step 1: Visual Identification - The soup is the only food item in the bowl, consisting of several large tomato pieces suspended in liquid. There appear to be about 5-6 chunks of whole or nearly whole tomatoes. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The bowl is medium-sized, approximately 15 cm in diameter based on common tableware proportions. The tomato pieces are roughly 3-5 cm each in size and submerged in a liquid soup that seems to fill about half of the bowl's depth. Assuming the bowl depth is about 5 cm, the soup portion visually fills around 2.5 to 3 cm in height. Step 3: Density Considerations - Tomato soup has moderate density, with both liquid and solid chunks. Tomato flesh density is close to water, about 0.9 g/cm3. Considering the broth adds volume but not much weight, a mostly water-based soup with tomato chunks suggests moderate weight per volume. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Calculating volume roughly as a cylinder: diameter ~15 cm, height ~3 cm gives volume ≈ π × (7.5 cm)^2 × 3 cm ≈ 530 cm3. With density close to water (~1 g/cm3), this correlates to approximately 500 grams. Given the sparse tomato chunks and watery broth, the real weight might be slightly less. A small to medium portion in Swiss context would be closer to 450-500 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The visible tomato quantity supports this moderate volume, and the liquid content likely outweighs the solid chunks. The herbal sprinkle is negligible in weight. Final estimate: the soup weighs about 470 grams.",19.567151638817204,36.93402773984924,2.9197080291970803

Visually, the mixture covers a circular area roughly 14-16 cm in diameter within the bowl and has a moderate height of approximately 3-4 cm, indicating a substantial volume. The mixture includes visible chunks of pork, broccoli florets, carrot pieces, red pepper strips, mushrooms, and some green peas, all coated in a creamy sauce. Pork is dense, and the cooked vegetables retain some density but are less heavy than meat. Considering the mixed nature and sauce, the overall density is moderate to high. Estimating volume approximately 200-250 ml, converting roughly to grams with a density slightly less than water (~0.9 to 1 g/ml) due to vegetables and sauce. Thus, the mixture likely weighs around 180 to 230 grams. Given the portion size and considering Swiss smaller portions, I settle on approximately 210 grams for the pork and vegetable mixture.

The portion covers a moderate area on a standard-sized dinner plate (about 26-28 cm diameter), roughly 10 cm across in a loose pile. Considering the depth and the creamy sauce binding the pasta, the volume appears average for a Swiss small-to-medium portion. Cooked pasta is dense and tends to weigh more than it looks; typical cooked pasta portion ranges between 100g (small) to 150g (medium).

The bowl is medium-sized, approximately 15-18 cm in diameter based on standard bowl proportions compared to the wooden table. The sauce tomate layer is moderately thick, but not overly abundant, suggesting a typical home serving rather than a heavy sauce amount. Visually estimating the depth of the sauce tomato, it looks about 0.5-1 cm thick, spread unevenly with pasta visible through it. Tomato sauce has moderate density, somewhat thick but with water content, generally around 1 g/cm³. Given the coverage area roughly corresponds to half the bowl bottom (about 100-120 cm²), and estimating an average thickness around 0.8 cm, the volume is approximately 80-96 cm³.

The volume of such a glass typically ranges between 200 to 250 ml. Since citronnade has a density close to water (about 1 g/ml), the weight of the liquid will be roughly equivalent to its volume in grams. Considering this is a nearly full glass, a reasonable estimate is 220 ml which corresponds to 220 grams. There is no visible garnish or ice cubes to account for additional volume or weight, so the estimate is just for the liquid in the glass without container weight.

The toppings (champignons, olives, courgettes) proportionally cover the pizza surface but are light compared to the dough and cheese. Visually estimating, the vegetable toppings represent approximately 15-20% of the total pizza weight. Taking a 325 gram total pizza as a reference, 20% corresponds to about 65 grams total vegetable toppings. Since five slices are present, the toppings on the visible pizza amount to approximately 54 grams.

Step 4: Considering this a medium portion typical of Swiss servings where vegetables are modest, the weight range for such a portion of sautéed carrots and leeks is approximately 80-110 grams. Given the volume shown, I lean toward the middle to upper part of this range. Step 5: Cross-validation confirms the visual volume, surface area, and typical density align with an estimate of around 95 grams. Therefore, the sautéed vegetables weigh approximately 95 grams.",23.343641492125272,44.06235094068946,4.306569343065694

The target food item is 'pâtes aux légumes (aubergines et carottes)', which appears on the right side of the plate. Visually, the pasta mixed with vegetables occupies about a third of the plate. The pasta is cut into short pieces and mixed with visible small chunks of vegetables. The plate is of standard Swiss small dinner size (about 20 cm diameter). Comparing the pasta portion to the other items on the plate (tomato slices and slices of dry- cured meat), the volume of the pasta mixed with vegetables seems consistent with a medium portion. Considering the depth of the food piled roughly 2-3 cm, the pasta and vegetable mixture is dense and cooked. Dense cooked pasta with vegetables typically weighs more than expected due to water content and vegetable density. A medium Swiss portion of pasta with vegetables would range between 130 to 170 grams.

The pasta with sauce appears dense and moist, indicating a somewhat heavier weight than dry pasta alone. Given the portion size on a standard Swiss plate (smaller portion standard), the total weight for these tortellini with sauce should be estimated at the middle range of typical portions. Considering 15 pieces averaging about 12 grams each, the total weight estimate is around 180 grams.

Each wedge is quite thick and firm, about 2 cm thick, 2-3 cm wide, and 6-8 cm long. Comparing the size to the broccoli florets and the plate size (standard small dinner plate), these potato pieces appear substantial. Pan-fried potatoes have a medium density (denser than steamed potatoes due to some fat absorption), so weight will be higher than raw volume alone suggests. Typical density is around 0.8 to 0.9 g/cm3. Estimating each wedge's volume roughly as a rectangular prism: 2 cm x 3 cm x 7 cm = 42 cubic cm per wedge. For 10 wedges, total volume about 420 cubic cm. Multiplying by the density (approx 0.85 g/cm3) gives about 357 grams. Given Swiss portions are smaller, and the potatoes do not completely fill the plate (some plate area is visible), I estimate the portion as a medium size, so adjusting down slightly to about 280 grams. This is reasonable given the visual size, thickness, and density considerations for pan-fried potatoes.

The noodles are partially covered by the other ingredients but visible around the edges and underneath. The noodles appear to be slender, flat rice noodles that are typical in Thai cuisine. Given the size of the bowl (medium-sized bowl), and the visible volume of noodles suggesting a layer of about 1.5 - 2 cm depth underneath the toppings, the rice noodles portion likely corresponds to a single serving. Noodles are dense but lightweight compared to meat and vegetables due to their structure. Visual volume alone suggests a medium Swiss portion size, smaller than US portions. An average cooked rice noodle portion in Switzerland is between 90 to 120 grams.

The jar is about the size of a small dessert container, approximately 7 cm in diameter and 8-9 cm tall, and is filled almost entirely with the yogurt-based mix. The yogurt is mixed with small seeds and oats but appears to form the bulk of the mixture, likely representing about 80% of the volume. Given that yogurt has a density close to 1.03 g/ml, and estimating the volume of yogurt as roughly 250 ml to 300 ml inside the jar, the weight is likely between 250 to 310 grams. Considering this is a typical Swiss-sized portion, a medium portion estimate would be near the middle of the range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'yogourt nature' in this jar to be approximately 275 grams.",26.513095962756882,50.04486293320005,5.766423357664234

The purée de pdt (mashed potatoes) is clearly visible as a white creamy base on the plate, supporting the meat ragout and surrounded by sauce. The mashed potatoes spread roughly cover a central oval area about 12 cm long and 7-8 cm wide, with an estimated thickness around 1.5 to 2 cm based on typical plating and visible surface texture. Using the plate diameter (approximately 25 cm) as reference, this size estimation seems accurate. Mashed potatoes have moderate density due to being cooked and mashed with some possible butter or milk, typically about 0.8 g/cm³. Volume is approximately 12 cm × 8 cm × 1.75 cm = 168 cm³. Multiplying by density: 168 × 0.8 = 134 grams approximately. Considering this is a Swiss portion which tends to be moderate, and slight uncertainty in thickness, a medium portion estimate around 130-140 grams feels reasonable. Therefore, based on visual and volume/density calculations, I estimate the purée de pdt portion to weigh approximately 135 grams.",26.658038906369224,50.31845036170721,5.839416058394161

The yogurt is dense and creamy, so its density is close to water but slightly thicker, roughly 1 g/ml. Since the yogurt fills about one third of the jar, the volume of yogurt is approximately 80 ml. Given the density near 1 g/ml, this corresponds to approximately 80 grams. Considering some visual uncertainty, the range would be 75-85 grams, so I estimate the weight of the yogourt mocca at 80 grams.",26.8028961153645,50.59187596161594,5.912408759124087

Focusing only on the spaghetti as requested: the spaghetti portion occupies almost the entire plate surface and is piled moderately high, indicating a sizeable but not overly large portion. The plate diameter seems typical for a side or main dish, and the spaghetti strands are cooked but not overly compacted, suggesting a normal cooked density. Comparing the portion volume to common Swiss portion sizes for pasta, which are smaller than US portions, I estimate this is a medium portion. Medium cooked pasta servings commonly range between 120-160 grams. Accounting for the visible depth and volume of the spaghetti (ignoring sauce and cheese), a weight estimate around the middle of this range fits well.

These potatoes appear cooked and roasted with some shrinkage but dense as potatoes retain density even after cooking. Comparing their size to the cheese slices and apple pieces, each potato likely weighs about 40-50 grams. Multiplying by 6 potatoes gives an estimated total weight range from 240 to 300 grams.

The glass is filled almost to the top, allowing us to estimate the volume visually. A typical small juice glass of this size holds approximately 100-120 ml of liquid. Given that orange juice density is close to water (1 g/ml), the volume in ml is a good proxy for weight in grams. The juice has visible pulp, but that doesn't significantly change density.

Step 1: Visual identification - The omelette consists of two pieces with visible tomato chunks distributed throughout. Step 2: Dimension analysis - The plate is approximately a small side plate (around 18-20 cm diameter) which helps scale the omelette pieces. Each slice is about 10 cm long and roughly 6-7 cm wide at the base, with an estimated thickness of 1.5 to 2 cm. Step 3: Density considerations - Omelettes are mostly cooked egg with some water content, and the tomatoes add some moisture but also small density variation. Cooked eggs have moderate density, slightly less than meat but more than leafy vegetables. Step 4: Portion size calibration - Two slices together make roughly half of a medium omelette, which commonly weighs between 120-180 grams for a full portion. Given the relatively thin slices and visible tomato pieces, this is likely a medium portion size. Step 5: Cross-validation - Considering the tomato content reduces overall density somewhat, and the relatively small size consistent with Swiss portion sizes, a reasonable estimate for the total omelette weight here is about 130 grams.",27.6586561956121,52.20716811685325,6.350364963503649

The target food item is the 'sandwich chèvre figue' visible in the image as a baguette sandwich placed on a table. Step 1: The sandwich appears to be a single whole baguette, approximately 25-30 cm in length. Step 2: The baguette bread typical in Switzerland is denser and smaller compared to US bread portions. The baguette thickness is moderate and about 5 cm wide. Inside, visible ingredients include slices of goat cheese ('chèvre'), pieces of fig, and some lettuce. The goat cheese slices appear moderate in thickness and quantity, about 2-3 thin slices evenly distributed along the sandwich. The fig pieces are likely fig jam or fresh fig portions, though visible amount is small. Lettuce leaves add volume but very low density. Step 3: Considering density, goat cheese is dense and contributes significant weight; figs add moderate weight; lettuce is very light and can be mostly ignored for weight. Step 4: Typically, a baguette sandwich of this type in Swiss portion sizes weighs approximately 200-250 grams in total bread and filling. Since the filling appears moderately applied without excess, and the bread is typical size, I estimate the total weight of the sandwich filling (chèvre and fig plus lettuce) as roughly 80-100 grams, bread around 150 grams. Step 5: The question targets 'sandwich chèvre figue' which is the whole sandwich, so the whole sandwich weight is the target estimate.

We see that the bowl is about a medium size, with the contents filling roughly half to two-thirds of the bowl. Given the creamy texture and the presence of mix-ins (oats and chia seeds), the mixture's density is moderate, slightly thicker than yogurt. Typical portion sizes of blanc battu used as a snack or breakfast in Switzerland are around 120 to 180 grams per serving.

Step 2: By comparing to the bowl size (roughly a medium-sized soup bowl) and the other food items, I estimate each bean to be around 12-15 cm long and about 3-4 cm wide, with a thickness of approximately 0.5-1 cm given their flat but fleshy nature. Step 3: Considering density, green beans are fairly dense cooked vegetables, so their weight is fairly concentrated in a small volume. Step 4: For 6-7 beans with this size, I calculate a total estimated weight range of roughly 100 to 140 grams, treating this as a medium portion. Step 5: Cross-validating with typical Swiss portion sizes for similar cooked green beans, which tend to be smaller portions than US sizes, I select a weight near the middle of this range. Therefore, I conclude the weight of the haticot coco in the bowl is approximately 120 grams.",29.300842771285758,55.30688163977688,7.226277372262774

The image shows a hand holding a clear glass bottle of Brio Maté, a commercial mate drink. The bottle is a typical long-necked glass bottle, similar in shape and size to standard 330 ml beverage bottles commonly sold in Switzerland. Such bottles usually weigh around 330 grams excluding the container weight. Since the request is to estimate the weight of the food item only, which in this case is the liquid mate inside, we exclude the bottle weight. The liquid volume appears nearly full, about 90% filled. Given the density of mate drinks is close to water at roughly 1 g/ml, the liquid mate weighs approximately the volume in grams. With a 330 ml bottle 90% full, the liquid content weighs about 297 grams. I estimate the weight of the mate liquid in the bottle to be 295 grams, rounding conservatively to Swiss portion standards.",29.432016735397248,55.55447939537605,7.299270072992701

The image shows a small metal bowl containing tiramisu aux fruits rouges with visible mixed red and black berries embedded in a creamy, layered mousse or mascarpone mixture. Step 1: Visual Identification - The portion is a single serving scoop, visibly mixing creamy layers with fruit berries including raspberries and blueberries. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The bowl is relatively small, approximately the size of a small dessert bowl (~10 cm diameter), and the portion occupies about half the bowl volume, estimating roughly 150 ml volume. The depth and density are typical of a tiramisu dessert: creamy but dense due to mascarpone and soaked biscuit layers. Step 3: Density Considerations - Tiramisu is fairly dense (mascarpone cheese, whipped cream, soaked biscuits), combined with the slight volume of dense berries. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given Swiss portion sizes and visible amount, this is a medium portion of tiramisu dessert likely prepared individually. Known typical tiramisu individual portions range around 120-150 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - The berries and creamy layers appear well mixed and dense, so the weight likely corresponds closely to volume in ml due to water and fat content. Considering the total mix and comparison with known dessert standards, an estimate near 140 grams is reasonable.",29.5628820548873,55.80149456802087,7.372262773722627

The target food item is 'caviar aubergines,' which is located in the top left part of the metal container. It appears as a mashed or pureed eggplant dish with a somewhat chunky texture. Visually, it forms a single mound roughly the size of half the container's length and about one-third the container's width. The container itself probably measures around 15 cm by 10 cm, giving the visible eggplant spread roughly a 7-8 cm length and 4-5 cm width area. The depth looks around 2-3 cm, given the somewhat mounded shape and container depth clues. Eggplant caviar is moderately dense but somewhat airy due to the mashed texture and typical water content of cooked eggplants. Using a density estimate of about 0.7 g/cm³ for mashed cooked eggplant, the volume based on 7 cm × 4.5 cm × 2.5 cm = approximately 79 cm³. Multiplying volume and density gives approximately 55 grams. Considering any mixing with rice grains visible and slight compression of the pile, a small reduction is warranted. Therefore, estimating 'caviar aubergines' weight conservatively at about 50 grams is reasonable for this Swiss portion size and visual evidence.",29.693635919375165,56.04829936348773,7.445255474452555

Given the size of the container for scale and the thickness of the pieces, the total volume corresponds to about half or slightly less of an average-sized pear. A medium pear typically weighs around 150-180 grams including skin. Considering these pieces are about half to two-thirds of a pear and the skin is mostly intact, I estimate the total weight between 80 and 120 grams. Based on visual fullness and portion size in Swiss context, a medium portion is about 100 grams.

The fennel is a vegetable with moderate density, and the gratiné cooking likely adds a minor amount of volume and weight but not significantly more. Comparing it to the rice and tofu sticks, the fenouil portion appears to occupy approximately one third of the container's bottom surface and rises about 2-3 cm in depth. Given fennel density and typical gratiné portions, I estimate a moderate portion here around 70-90 grams.

The image shows a clear container with gnocchi au basilic, cauliflower florets, and grated cheese. The target food is ""gnocchi au basilic."" I start by visually identifying the gnocchi, which are the small, oblong, pale green pieces with visible basil specks, located mostly at the bottom and left side of the container. There are approximately 15 individual gnocchi pieces visible. Each gnocchi piece is roughly 3-4 cm long and about 1.5-2 cm thick, appearing dense and compact as typical cooked gnocchi. The gnocchi form a single layer with some slight overlap but no deep piling, so the volume can be estimated by count and average size rather than volume stacking. Given the density of cooked potato gnocchi with herbs, which is relatively high, each piece can weigh approximately 15-18 grams based on Swiss portion sizes. Multiplying the count (15) by an average of 16 grams results in a range of 225-270 grams. Considering the portion size looks medium rather than large or very small, I estimate the gnocchi au basilic weight to be about 240 grams, accounting for density and slight variation in piece size. The cheese is only lightly scattered on top and the cauliflower is separate, so they do not add to the gnocchi weight.",30.32609161601179,57.24209275125211,7.810218978102189

The container is cylindrical, with a depth slightly more than its diameter, and the yogurt is filled flush to the top without air gaps. Considering the standard small yogurt cup portion in Switzerland and comparing to the usual weight of similar individual yogurt portions, the estimated weight of the contents (excluding the container) is roughly around 100 grams.

The sandwich contains about 4-5 slices of semi-hard cheese, visible with some overlapping, each roughly 1-2 mm thick, plus a few leaves of lettuce. The cheese is denser than bread and leafy greens, so the cheese slices alone likely weigh around 40-50 grams in total. The baguette, considering its size and density, is estimated to weigh between 120-140 grams. Lettuce adds negligible weight, about 5 grams. Summing these estimates and considering the portion as medium-sized, the total weight of the sandwich au fromage (focusing only on the cheese inside) is about 45 grams of cheese. Since the prompt asks specifically for the weight of 'sandwich au fromage' as a whole food item, standard practice is to include the whole sandwich without container but taking everything inside (bread and filling).

Estimating volume based on plate size (standard dinner plate of about 25-27cm diameter), the pasta mound is around 10cm by 6cm in surface area and about 2-3cm deep on average. Cooked pasta with sauce generally has a density around 0.9-1.1 g/cm3 due to sauce moisture. Using a conservative approach balanced for sauce density and visual fullness, a medium portion in this size range weighs approximately 140-170 grams. Selecting a midpoint, the estimated weight for the pasta with demi-cream and saffron sauce is about 155 grams.",31.75247558706779,59.934467509065506,8.686131386861314

There is a label on the banana with some weight and price information, but the weight is not directly visible due to the angle. Visually, the banana appears typical in size and shape, without being particularly large or small. Given that Swiss portion sizes tend to be smaller than US portions, we consider a medium banana weight to be around 120-140 grams. Considering the density of a banana, which is moderately dense but not too heavy, and the visual similarity to a standard banana, I estimate the weight of this banana to be approximately 130 grams.",31.85892368761735,60.135393896877225,8.75912408759124

The millet portion is fluffy, granular, and appears loose but accumulated in a somewhat flat pile. Comparing the millet to the plate size (a standard medium-sized rectangular plate roughly 20-25 cm wide), the millet occupies about a quarter of the plate's surface, with moderate thickness, suggesting a shallow mound approximately 2-3 cm thick. Millet is a small grain that when cooked has moderate density but is lighter than dense starches like rice or couscous. Given the portion size visible, it resembles a small to medium portion typically served in Swiss meals. Estimating millet density around 0.8 g/cm3 and considering volume coverage, the millet portion likely weighs between 90 and 130 grams; choosing the midpoint for this portion size, I estimate the millet at about 110 grams.",31.964814513155975,60.335268398799144,8.832116788321168

Focusing on the frites, they are uniform, uncooked, and piled loosely without compacting. Counting the fries roughly yields around 50 to 60 pieces. Each frozen French fry typically weighs about 5-7 grams given their size and density. Lengthwise, each fry appears around 7-9 cm, standard for typical frozen fries seen in Swiss portions. Considering the amount, the total volume looks like a medium portion for Swiss standards. Accounting for the loose pile and the uncooked state, I estimate a weight range of 200-250 grams for the fries. Since the portion is moderate and not overly packed, a middle value around 230 grams is reasonable for the visible amount of frozen fries in the container.",32.069959447526124,60.53373499191471,8.905109489051094

Comparing the rice to the other foods (ratatouille and soufflé au fromage) and considering the standard French/Swiss portion size, this looks like a medium portion. The plate diameter can be assumed to be around 22 cm (standard small plate), and the rice depth, based on volume, is about 2 cm on average. Given that cooked white rice density is about 130-140 g per 100 ml, I estimate the rice volume to be approximately 150-170 ml, corresponding to roughly 200-240 grams.

Focusing solely on the 'pâtes' (pasta), the fusilli are well-cooked and loosely arranged, occupying slightly less than half the plate's surface. Using the plate diameter as a reference (standard small plate around 22 cm), the pasta portion measures approximately 12 cm by 10 cm and has an estimated depth of around 2-2.5 cm given the way the pasta is layered without compression. Fusilli pasta, cooked, has a density close to 1 g/cm³. Multiplying length × width × depth, the volume is about 12 × 10 × 2.3 = 276 cm³, thus roughly 270-280 g in volume. Considering the pasta is loosely piled with some air gaps, adjusting downward to about 220-240 g is reasonable.

Focusing on the ratatouille, it appears as a moist vegetable stew containing visible chunks of zucchini, eggplant, and tomato sauce. The ratatouille portion covers about one-third of the plate. The plate diameter is standard, about 24 cm, so the ratatouille area is roughly 8 cm by 12 cm, with an estimated average depth of about 1.5 cm given the visible layering and moisture content. This volume corresponds to approximately 144 cubic centimeters. Ratatouille is composed mainly of cooked vegetables, which have a density close to water (~1 g/cm³), so the weight would be around 140 grams. Considering some moisture loss and potentially less density due to air pockets, the realistic range is about 120 to 150 grams.

First, I identify the mango chunks by their yellow-orange color and larger size compared to the apple pieces with red skin. There are about 12 visible pieces of mango, which look roughly cuboid with size approximately 3-4 cm per side. Mango flesh is dense and juicy, so the chunks likely weigh more than they appear. Considering the volume (around 3-4 cm length × 2.5 cm width × 2.5 cm depth on average gives about 20-25 cm³ per piece), and that mango density is about 0.85 g/cm³, each chunk weighs approximately 17-21 grams. Multiplying by 12 pieces results in a range of 200-250 grams total mango weight. The portion size fits a medium Swiss serving for chopped mango in a bowl.

This portion is approximately rectangular, about the size of a small dessert plate segment, roughly 8 cm by 7 cm in surface area. The thickness appears around 3 cm considering the biscuit base, fruit layer, and the creamy topping, with the biscuit soaking some moisture from the fruits. The biscuit is dense but somewhat aerated, the fruits add a light layer, and the séré+mascarpone mix is creamy and soft, adding moderate density. The visible fruits on top are about 4 pieces (2 raspberries, 2 blueberries), but fruits are also embedded inside the dessert. Given the layering and density, this slice closely matches a medium portion of this dessert type common in Swiss servings. A similar portion size dessert typically weighs around 130-160 grams.

It has an irregular shape but occupies a substantial portion of the plate's left side. Comparing it to the known size of the plate (standard dinner plate around 25-27 cm diameter), the omelette's area suggests a volume roughly equivalent to a small to medium Swiss portion. The thickness is about 2-3 cm as per the folds and visible height, indicating a dense, cooked egg texture with cheese. Considering that cooked egg omelettes with cheese have a density close to 0.9-1.1 g/cm3, and estimating the overall volume around 120-150 cm3, this gives a weight approximately between 110 to 160 grams. Given the portion seems moderate, leaning towards the medium size, the best estimate is close to the middle to upper middle of the range, about 140 grams.

Typical whole wheat bread density is moderate, and a slice of this size generally weighs between 40 to 50 grams. Given the three slices visible, but the target is only 'pain complet' as a single item, it is likely that the request is for the total bread weight on the plate. I will assume all three slices together represent the portion. Therefore, multiplying an estimated 45 grams per slice by three slices gives a weight of approximately 135 grams.

Comparing to the other visible ingredients (tomato, carrot, and sérac) and the size of the bowl and cutlery beside it, the cucumber portion seems moderate. Cucumber is relatively light but with considerable volume due to water content. I estimate the cucumber portion weighs between 70 and 100 grams. Given the volume and density, I place the estimate closer to the medium portion range, around 85 grams.",35.62292200721887,67.2401386709261,11.678832116788321

The target food is 'pâtes' (pasta) visible inside a small glass jar. Step 1: Identifying the pasta inside the jar alongside sauce, peppers, and grated parmesan. The pasta is spaghetti shaped and occupies roughly half to two-thirds of the jar's volume. Step 2: The jar is small, likely holding about 250 ml total volume. The pasta appears packed with some sauce and vegetables, making the volume occupied by pasta slightly less than the jar's volume. Step 3: Considering pasta density: cooked pasta is dense and compact, so volume corresponds fairly closely to weight. A typical cooked pasta density is roughly 150 g per cup (240 ml) solid weight. Since the pasta fills about 130-150 ml of the jar portion, the pasta weight should be around 80-90 grams. Step 4: Portion size: this looks like a small to medium portion given Swiss smaller serving sizes, so I choose the middle of the range. Step 5: Cross-validation: the presence of sauce and vegetables reduces pure pasta volume somewhat, but the pasta strands appear tightly coiled, compensating for that. Therefore, I estimate the 'pâtes' weight as approximately 85 grams.",35.70651325885854,67.39792155439616,11.751824817518248

Each slice appears to be roughly 10 cm long and about 4-5 cm wide, with about 1.5 cm thickness. Given the typical density and size of braided bread, an average slice might weigh between 35 and 45 grams. Since there are two slices present, but the target is only one slice of pain tressé, I focus on one slice. The bread is plain and no additional toppings are included in the estimation. Therefore, estimating conservatively within the medium portion range, the weight of one slice of pain tressé is about 40 grams.",35.788818491242225,67.55327700888976,11.824817518248175

The whole pepper is medium-sized, approximately matching the size of an average Swiss bell pepper, roughly 8 cm tall and about 7 cm in diameter. The slices appear to be from the same pepper, each about one-fifth to one-fourth of the pepper's volume. Yellow bell pepper has a relatively low density, with about 0.3 to 0.4 g/cm³. A typical medium bell pepper weighs around 120 to 150 grams. Considering the hollowed middle removed mostly seeds and white pith, the edible raw pepper volume is reduced by around 20%. The two slices plus the hollowed pepper's remaining fleshy parts combined visually account for most of the pepper flesh.

Comparing to the plate which is a standard medium-sized plate (about 25 cm diameter), the portion occupies roughly a quarter of the plate. The volume and thickness appear moderate, around 1.5 to 2 cm thick on average. Cooked rice and lentils are dense foods, so this portion likely weighs more than it appears. Typical cooked rice or lentil servings of this visible size usually range from 150 to 220 grams.

The pieces vary in size, with some larger chunks around 5-6 cm in length and others smaller, possibly closer to 3-4 cm. The depth of the curry sauce suggests some chicken pieces may be partially submerged, indicating more volume than a flat surface suggests. Considering chicken's density (dense meat), and that the sauce adds weight but does not count as a separate food item, we focus only on the chicken pieces. Given Swiss portion sizes are generally smaller than US portions, this looks like a medium portion. A single medium chicken breast piece with sauce can weigh around 40-50 grams.

Considering the volume relative to the other items, the endive appears to cover about 1/5 of the plate's surface. In terms of depth, the chopped endive is thin but piled up, suggesting some volume hidden beneath the surface layer. Endive is a leafy vegetable with moderate density – more dense than lettuce but lighter than cooked vegetables. Estimating the volume roughly as a small handful, this would put the weight between 40 and 60 grams.

Each tofu cube appears to be roughly 3 cm on each edge, a typical size for cubed tofu in meal portions. Firm tofu density is around 0.96 g/cm³, but since the tofu is marinated and includes mango flavoring (likely adding slight moisture but not weight increase), the density should remain close to this value. Each cube's volume would be approximately 27 cm³ (3x3x3), meaning each cube weighs about 26 grams (27 cm³ * 0.96 g/cm³). Multiplying by 8 cubes results in approximately 208 grams. Given the cubes vary slightly in size and some may not be fully shown or could be partially sunk under the surface, I adjust downwards slightly. Also considering Swiss portions tend to be smaller, I take a conservative middle estimate reducing by about 15%, leading to roughly 175 grams.

Step 2: Dimension-wise, each petit pain au chocolat appears about 6-7 cm in diameter and has a typical thickness of about 3-4 cm based on the puffiness of the dough and chocolate. The granite surface gives a rough scale reference indicating standard size for small French pastries. Step 3: These are dense pastries with chocolate filling, so they are relatively heavy compared to simple bread rolls. Typically, a Swiss-sized petit pain au chocolat weighs less than larger bakery standards, but still roughly 50-60 grams each.

Step 2, using the plate as a size reference, the pasta pieces are typical penne size, about 4 cm long each, and appear to be cooked, thus denser and heavier than dry pasta. The total volume of the pile is quite small, roughly equivalent to a few tablespoons or about a quarter cup. Step 3, considering density, cooked pasta is dense and compact, meaning weight is significant for its visual size. Corn and tomato add little extra weight but must be considered. Step 4, for portion size calibration, this is a very small leftover portion, much less than a standard side portion of pasta salad which would be around 150-180 g.

The pieces are roughly rectangular, about 8-10 cm in length, 2-3 cm in width, and appear to be approximately 1.5-2 cm thick. Considering the typical density of breaded tofu, which is moderate due to the breading and the firm tofu core, each piece likely weighs around 25-30 grams. Multiplying by six pieces gives a total preliminary weight range of 150-180 grams. Since the portion looks medium-sized and not overly large, I lean towards the mid-range estimate.

The panna cotta portion is the creamy white layer in the bottom half to two thirds of the glass, while the raspberry topping occupies the top third. Considering typical panna cotta density as a creamy, dense gelatin dessert, and the volume estimated visually as about 100-120 ml total, the panna cotta (excluding the raspberry topping weight) should be in the range of 90-110 grams. The raspberry topping is relatively thin, so it weighs less and is excluded from this estimation.

The target food item is 'poulet + sauce curry,' which is clearly visible as two chicken strips covered in a yellow curry sauce lying on top of rice. For visual identification, I can see two sizeable pieces of chicken breast or tenderloin. They appear evenly coated with curry sauce. Comparing the chicken strips to the standard width and height of the rectangular glass container, which is likely around 15 cm in length and about 6-7 cm in width, each chicken strip seems to be approximately 12 cm long, 3 cm wide, and about 1.5-2 cm thick including sauce. This gives a moderate volume. The sauce adds some slight volume but is mostly on the surface and does not greatly increase weight beyond the chicken itself. Considering density, cooked chicken breast without bone usually weighs around 1.05 g/cm3. Given the relatively dense composition and compact shape, I approximate each strip’s weight around 70-90 grams with sauce. Two strips hence fall in the range of approximately 140-180 grams. Given the portion looks like a standard medium, not overly large nor very small, a midrange estimate is appropriate. Therefore, I estimate the 'poulet + sauce curry' weight as approximately 160 grams, excluding any container weight.",40.99484734951432,77.37993025996562,17.956204379562045

The target food item is 'couscous complet', which is visible on the plate as a beige granular portion occupying roughly one third of the plate. The plate itself is standard European-sized, approximately 22-24 cm in diameter, which helps scale the portion. The couscous portion is spread and has some volume in depth as well, appearing fluffy. Couscous, especially whole wheat (complet), is dense when cooked but still light compared to other grains. Visually, this portion looks to be medium-sized, closely packed but not overly heaped, roughly equivalent to about 150-180 grams. Considering sous portion sizes in Switzerland which tend to be smaller, I lean toward the lower-middle of this range. Cross-validating this with the surrounding vegetables and chicken showing typical portion sizes, the couscous portion is best estimated at about 160 grams.",41.82673891237067,78.95016933339983,19.27007299270073

The image shows a single nectarine placed on a dark fabric surface. There are no other food items or utensils for size comparison, but the texture of the fabric and common size expectations for nectarines help provide context. A typical nectarine is spherical and roughly the size of a medium apple, generally between 150 and 200 grams. Given the visible smooth skin and lack of auxiliary objects, I will assume this nectarine is of average size for a Swiss portion, which tends to be smaller than US portions. Swiss medium peaches and nectarines typically weigh around 140 to 160 grams.

I count approximately 15 pieces of haricots coco, varying slightly in size but generally around 5-7 cm in length and about 2-3 cm wide. The pieces are thick and dense, arranged in a single layer without significant stacking, so depth is roughly 2 cm. Considering the density of cooked haricots coco, which is moderately dense similar to cooked green beans, I estimate about 10-12 grams per piece on average due to thickness and water content. Multiplying 15 pieces by an average of 11 grams yields approximately 165 grams. Given that the portion looks moderate and not piled high, I adjust down slightly for some variation and moisture content than a US portion. Therefore, the final estimated weight of the haricots coco is 150 grams.",41.91331372868426,79.11358385209529,19.416058394160583

The bircher portion covers roughly half of the bowl's surface area with a moderate depth around 2-3 cm estimated by bowl size and visible thickness. Considering a typical small to medium Swiss bowl size of around 10-12 cm diameter, the bircher portion volume is approximately 150-180 ml. Given the dense, creamy texture of the bircher, its density is relatively high, close to yogurt or thick porridge, which typically weighs about 1 g/ml. Thus, the bircher likely weighs about 150-180 grams. Considering the portion appears a bit smaller than average but still substantial, the best estimate is in the middle range, approximately 165 grams.",41.956181037217426,79.19449815131071,19.48905109489051

To estimate the weight of the sauce tomato alone, I observe the coverage and thickness. The sauce layer is moderate—covering the tortellini pieces but not heavily pooling on the plate. The tortellini portion looks like a medium Swiss portion, roughly 10 pieces with sauce coverage. Typical tomato sauce on pasta at this portion size weighs about 40-60 grams in Switzerland. Given the medium coverage and standard plating, I estimate the sauce tomate to be around 50 grams.

By comparison to the granite surface texture and common dimensions of nectarines, its diameter is approximately 6-7 cm. Considering the density of stone fruits like nectarines, which include their skin and juicy flesh, a nectarine of this size typically weighs between 130 and 160 grams. No pieces are missing or hidden, and there are no layers or mixing involved, so the weight estimation is straightforward.

They form a single layer with some minor pile but not very dense or thick. Given that cooked pasta is denser and heavier per volume than raw pasta, but these look dry and uncooked which weighs less. The portion size appears moderate, about the size of a small handful of dry penne. Standard dry penne pasta weighs about 70-80 grams per cup (180 ml), and this amount looks close to half a cup, so approximately 35-40 grams.

The bowl is moderately sized, and the peanut butter appears to be thick but smooth, filling about half to two-thirds of the bowl's visible volume. Given the Swiss portion context, this serving is medium-sized rather than an oversized portion. Peanut butter is a dense food, so the volume corresponds to a heavier weight than it might appear. Estimating the depth and volume of the peanut butter, it seems to be roughly 150 to 200 ml in volume, which translates to approximately 150 to 190 grams given peanut butter's density (~1 g/ml).
