# volumetric-estimation-of-food-bachelor-project

## Version 1 (v1-2025-04-03):  
give the llm one food class per image  
weight data not cleaned  

### Files:  
data/v1/comparison_data/comparison_{result_file_name}: contains the key, image_id, url, description, weight, predicted_weight, absolute_error of each food class that was annotated  
data/v1/comparison_data/sorted_{result_file_name}: contains the same lines as comparison file but with the absolute error sorted in decreasing order  
data/v1/prompt_data/prompt_{result_file_id}: contains the prompt used to generate the corresponding result file, using ChatGPT 4o (2024-11-20)  
data/v1/result/result_file_name: contains the resulting file from the LLM prediction  
data/weight_data.csv: original data  
data/v1/weight_data_ready.csv: original data formatted for the benchmarking tool  
data/v1/weight_data_sample.csv: sample (100) from original data  
data/v1/weight_data_sample_ready.csv: sample (100) from original data formatted for the benchmarking tool  
src/v1/comparison.py: script that creates the files in the folder comparison_data from a result file and writes the results of the metrics in metrics_results.csv  
src/v1/format.py: script that creates the formatted files for the benchmarking tool  
src/v1/metrics_results.csv: file containing the metrics results for each result file  

## Version 2 :  
give the llm all the food items on the image, ask it to evaluate the weight of only one food item  
data cleaned (in process)


data/cleaned/weight_data_cleaned.csv: original data, cleaned  
data/cleaned/weight_data_cleaned_grouped.csv: cleaned data with an additional column containing all the food items on the picture  
data/cleaned/weight_data_cleaned_sample.csv: sample (100) from cleaned data  
data/ready/weight_data_cleaned_ready.csv: cleaned data formatted for the benchmarking tool  
data/ready/weight_data_cleaned_sample_ready.csv: sample (100) from cleaned data formatted for the benchmarking tool  
data/comparison/sorted_{result_file_name}: contains the same lines as comparison file but with the absolute error sorted in decreasing order  
data/prompt/prompt_{result_file_id}: contains the prompt used to generate the corresponding result file, using ChatGPT 4o (2024-11-20)  
data/result/result_file_name: contains the resulting file from the LLM prediction  
data/weight_data.csv: original data  
data/removed_logs.csv: contains the removed rows and the reason why it was removed  
src/format.py: script that creates the formatted files for the benchmarking tool  
src/comparison.py: script that creates the files in the folder comparison from a result file and writes the results of the metrics in metrics_results.csv  
src/metrics_results.csv: file containing the metrics results for each result file  
  
  
When deleting rows in weight_data_cleaned.csv, always put the deleted row in removed_logs.csv and add a reason. Then run:  
```python format.py --liquid```: to update the file weight_data_cleaned_ready.csv.  
Then run python ```format.py --no-liquid``` with:  
```--sample```: to generate a new sample file from the new cleaned data  
( ```--no-liquid```: generates a new file (ready and grouped) excluding the data that contains liquids such as water, milk, coffee, tea, bier, wine, juice, oil etc.)

Once a result has been obtained, put the corresponding file in data/result and run:  
- If the data is a sample data : ```python comparison.py --json {result_file_name}```: to create a sorted_{result_file_name} with the errors sorted by absolute value  
- If the data is the whole data : ```python comparison.py --json {result_file_name} --wholedata```: to create a sorted_{result_file_name} with the errors sorted by the total dish weighed absolute error  
The following arguments are available:  
```--no-liquid```: use it to indicate that the data doesn't contain liquids  
```--errors```: use it to display the 20 highest errors in the terminal  

Prompt optimization using OpenAI API:  
The following file contains the code to automatically optimize a prompt using GPT-o3???? for now **src/prompt_opti.py**. The available arguments are:  
```--prompt```: indicate the name of the file containing the prompt to be optimized  
```--errors```: indicate the name of the file containing the results generated by this prompt  
The optimized prompt will be saved to **data/prompt/optimized** with the name of the original prompt and a timestamp.
