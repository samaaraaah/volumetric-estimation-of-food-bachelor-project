STEP 1: VISUAL IDENTIFICATION: The target food is crème caramel served in a small blue bowl. There is only one portion visible. The crème caramel is creamy, smooth, and occupies the bottom of the bowl. STEP 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS: The bowl is hand-held and appears to be a small dessert bowl, likely around 12-14 cm in diameter. The crème caramel fills roughly 20-25% of the bowl's inner volume. Thickness appears to be roughly 1.5-2 cm deep. Given the measured size from hand and leg for scale, the visible amount is consistent with a small single serving. STEP 3: DENSITY CONSIDERATIONS: Crème caramel is a custard dessert, fairly dense and creamy, somewhat similar to pudding. Its density is close to water or slightly heavier, approx 1 g/cm3 or a bit more. STEP 4: PORTION SIZE CALIBRATION: A typical small crème caramel dessert may be around 100-150g. The portion here is not very large, leaning towards a smaller to medium size dessert. STEP 5: CROSS-VALIDATION: Considering the visible volume and density and comparison to usual Swiss dessert portions, the weight is likely about 120 grams. This weight excludes the bowl and is based solely on visual evidence of the crème caramel quantity. \",\n  \"crème caramel\": 120\n}",

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is 'délice des dieux,' a layered dessert with biscuit base, red fruits, and a creamy layer of séré and mascarpone. The piece is a single slice on a small dessert plate. Only one piece is visible, no hidden parts or multiple pieces. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Comparing to the small plate and the size of the berries on top (raspberries and blueberries), the slice is about 8 cm by 6 cm on the plate surface. The berry size helps confirm scale. The thickness of the slice looks roughly 3 to 4 cm, including the biscuit base, fruit layer, and creamy top. Step 3: Density Considerations - The biscuit base (likely moist with the fruit layer) has medium density, berries add some weight but are light, and the creamy mascarpone/séré topping is thick and dense but lightened by air incorporation. Overall, this dessert slice has a moderate density; not as heavy as pure cake but denser than mousse. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Based on typical Swiss dessert portions, this is a medium-sized piece (common dessert slice). Step 5: Cross-validation - The visible volume (8x6x3.5 cm = 168 cubic cm approx) multiplied by an estimated average density around 0.8 to 1g/cm3 (due to cream and fruit layers), gives a weight estimate between 135g to 170g. Considering possible air content in cream, selecting a middle ground weight. Final estimation: approximately 150 grams.\",\n  \"délice des dieux (biscuit, fruits rouges, séré+mascarpone)\": 150\n}",

In the image, there are four distinct waffle quarters arranged on a plate. Each waffle piece is approximately the size of a small to medium square, about 8 cm by 8 cm based on comparison to the plate size and the salmon slices on top. The waffles appear to be about 1.5 to 2 cm thick, showing a dense but somewhat airy texture typical of sweet potato waffles. Considering the density of sweet potato-based waffle batter, which is denser than regular waffles but lighter than pure baked goods, an individual portion of this thickness and surface area typically weighs around 40-50 grams. Multiplying by four pieces results in an estimated weight range between 160 and 200 grams. The waffles also do not appear heavily soaked or greasy, so no extra water or fat weight is added. Given the visual size, thickness, and texture, a medium portion estimate around 180 grams is reasonable and aligns with Swiss portion expectations without being underestimated.\",\n  \"gaufre à la patate douce\": 180\n}",

There are several tomato pieces, about 7 visible, chopped into medium-sized chunks. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each tomato piece appears roughly 3-4 cm in length and about 2 cm thick. The tomato pieces look fresh and juicy, with a typical density for fresh tomatoes. Step 3: Density Considerations - Tomatoes are mostly water and relatively light. Average fresh tomato density is about 0.95 g/cm3. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Considering the portion is small in total volume on the plate, the total tomato volume (estimated roughly 7 pieces each about 3x2x2 cm = 12 cm3 average) is approximately 84 cm3 in aggregate. Multiplying by density gives roughly 84 * 0.95 ~ 80 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - Given the size of the plate (about 20-22 cm diameter), the tomato pieces take up a small portion but are dense enough. The estimated weight seems reasonable for a small side salad portion. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'tomates' as 80 grams.\",\"tomates\":80}",

STEP 1: VISUAL IDENTIFICATION - The target food is \\\"chili.\\\" It is located on the right half of the plate as a chunky, reddish-brown saucy mixture containing visible pieces of meat (which should be cervelas), kidney beans, and sauce. STEP 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS - The chili portion covers roughly half of the plate's right side in a slightly piled manner, with visible chunks about 2-3 cm in size. The plate is a standard size, approximately 25 cm in diameter (visual estimate). The chili looks moderately thick, with depth likely around 2-3 cm based on the volume implied by the visible piled pieces and the sauce. STEP 3: DENSITY CONSIDERATIONS - Chili containing sausage pieces and beans is relatively dense but also contains sauce which lowers the density slightly. Typical density may be approximately 1.0 g/cm3 to 1.1 g/cm3. STEP 4: PORTION SIZE CALIBRATION - The area covered by chili is around half the plate area (~pi*(12.5^2)/2 = ~245 cm2). With an estimated depth of 2.5 cm, volume is approximately 245*2.5 = 612.5 cm3. Assuming a density roughly 1.0 g/cm3, the chili weighs about 610 grams. Visual though, the chili portion is likely somewhat shallower in the sauce and some space is air pockets; to be conservative, we lower it to about 450-500 grams as a medium portion. STEP 5: CROSS-VALIDATION - The portion is consistent with a Swiss medium portion rather than a large one; the size and chunk count match with an estimated weight around 470 grams.

Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The container is medium sized and the vegetable portion occupies about half the container volume. The visible depth is about 2-3 cm and the coverage is dense but not packed tight, indicating some water content remains. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cooked courgette and onion has moderate density; neither very dense nor very light because cooking reduces volume but retains water and structure. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The quantity appears medium-sized for a single serving; approximating dimensions about 10 cm by 7 cm surface area, 2.5 cm depth, yielding approximately 175 cubic cm. Given cooked vegetable density close to 0.9 g/cm³, estimated weight is about 160 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - This matches expectations for a mixed cooked vegetable portion in a Swiss context.

They are clearly visible in the palm of a hand. There are approximately 20 whole and partial cashew nuts visible. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Cashews are relatively small nuts, usually about 2-3 cm in length and about 1-1.5 cm in width and thickness. Given the size relative to the hand, this matches typical cashews. The nuts are not piled significantly; they form a single layer in the hand. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cashew nuts are dense and fatty, with a relatively high density compared to other nuts. A single cashew nut weighs roughly between 1.2 to 1.5 grams on average. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - With about 20 cashews, taking an average weight of 1.3 grams per nut, the total would be approximately 26 grams. Given some variability in size and partial pieces, a slight downward adjustment is reasonable to around 23-25 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The volume and hand size suggest not more than roughly 25 grams. Since the nuts fill the palm but are not heaped, the estimate aligns with typical cashew nut portions. Therefore, the best estimate for the cashews in the hand is 24 grams.\",\n  \"noix de cajou\": 24\n}",

It is the white creamy mass on the plate underneath the meat ragout and sauce. It appears as one single portion, spread moderately but contained within the center of the plate. No additional portions are visible. STEP 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS - The plate is a standard size (usually about 25-27 cm diameter). The mashed potatoes cover roughly a 12 cm by 8 cm area and have a thickness of about 2 cm as estimated by the layering underneath the meat and considering its slight elevation compared to the plate surface. The depth might not be perfectly uniform but this average seems reasonable. STEP 3: DENSITY CONSIDERATIONS - Mashed potatoes have a density close to 0.85 g/cm3 on average, being fluffy but still dense due to starch. STEP 4: PORTION SIZE CALIBRATION - Volume estimate: 12 cm x 8 cm x 2 cm = 192 cm3. Estimated weight = volume x density = 192 x 0.85 ≈ 163 grams. The portion looks moderate in Swiss context, so I select the mid-to-lower end of range ~160 grams. STEP 5: CROSS-VALIDATION - This weight is reasonable for a single serving of mashed potatoes on a dinner plate as compared to the meat and carrots. The mashed potatoes do not overflow or seem overly generous. Thus, the weight estimate is consistent with visual evidence and norms. Final estimation: 160 grams.\",\n  \"purée de pdt\": 160\n}",

In the image, they are located in a small clustered pile on the left side of the black bowl, next to the raspberries (framboises). There are approximately 10 visible blueberries, some partially overlapping. Step 2: Dimension analysis - Each blueberry is roughly spherical with diameter around 1.5-2 cm based on the comparison to the hand holding the bowl and the other foods like raspberries. The blueberries appear fresh and typical in size. Step 3: Density considerations - Blueberries have a density close to water, roughly 1 g per cm³; average blueberry weight is about 1-1.5 grams each. Step 4: Portion size calibration - With about 10 blueberries visible and considering some could be partially hidden but likely only one layer given the shallow view, estimate around 10 pieces × 1.3 grams average = approximately 13 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - This aligns with typical blueberry servings visually and weights. No excess hidden volume is expected. Therefore, the estimated weight for myrtilles is about 13 grams.\",\n  \"myrtilles\": 13\n}",

It is the piece on the left side of the plate, characterized by layers of soaked sponge cake and creamy mascarpone topping with cocoa powder dusted on top. There is only one visible piece of tiramisu. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Comparing the tiramisu to the plate (standard dessert plate around 18-20 cm diameter), the tiramisu slice is about 10 cm long, 4-5 cm wide, and approximately 3-4 cm thick. The depth is evident from the side, showing significant layering and cream content. Step 3: Density Considerations - Tiramisu is a mixture of creamy mascarpone, soaked cake (which absorbs liquid and weighs more), and sugar. This combination is moderately dense but softer and less dense than pure cake, but more dense than whipped cream alone. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - A typical small Swiss dessert portion for tiramisu ranges between 100 and 150 grams. Visually, this portion is medium-sized, given the length and thickness. Step 5: Cross-validation - Considering density, layering, and visible volume, and comparing to known tiramisu slice weights, the estimate is around the middle to slightly upper side of the medium portion range.

Step 3: Bananas have medium density, mostly water and carbohydrates. A medium banana typically weighs about 120-150 g. Step 4: Since this is about half a banana based on length, the weight is estimated roughly in the range of 60-75 g. Step 5: Cross-validation - size and peeled state confirm visible flesh with no peel. No hidden volume to consider.

The pasta depth appears moderate, about 1.5-2 cm thick on average. The pasta includes medium-sized penne with some smaller curved shell pasta. Step 3: Density considerations show cooked pasta with sauce and cured meat ingredients. Cooked pasta dishes are quite dense and moist, averaging approximately 140-160 g per 100 cm³ volume. Step 4: Portion size is medium for a Swiss meal context, not overly piled but fairly generous with meat bits distributed throughout. Step 5: Cross-validation avoids underestimating due to the sauce and meat pieces; total volume likely around 120-140 cm³, yielding an estimated weight close to 180 grams. Considering visual volume and density typical of carbonara, 180 grams seems accurate and reasonable. Thus, the carbonara portion weighs approximately 180 grams.\",\n  \"pâtes carbonara\": 180\n}",

There is one galette wrap visible. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The galette wrap nearly fills the plate which is a standard small dinner plate (~22-24 cm diameter). The wrap is thin, about 2-3 mm thick, consistent with typical galette wraps. Its diameter is roughly 22 cm. Step 3: Density Considerations - Galette wraps are thin flatbreads, quite light but denser than very airy breads. Given its thinness and whole surface area coverage, the density is moderate but volume is low due to its thinness. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - A typical galette wrap (approx. 20-22 cm) in Switzerland weighs between 40 to 60 grams depending on thickness and ingredients. This one looks standard thickness, not very thick or very thin, so a medium portion applies. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The visual size and known standard weights align well.

The size relative to the plate shows the slice is roughly 10 cm wide at the crust edge, about 2-3 cm thick including strawberries and filling. The crust edge is quite thin but extends over the entire slice base. STEP 3: DENSITY CONSIDERATIONS - The tart crust is baked pastry, which is dense but thin. The filling appears creamy, similar to pastry cream, medium density. Strawberries add volume but are light. STEP 4: PORTION SIZE CALIBRATION - A whole standard strawberry tart typically weighs around 600-700 grams. One-eighth slice would be 75-90 grams. The visible slice looks slightly smaller than a full eighth, closer to 6/50th of the whole tart, so about 70 grams. STEP 5: CROSS-VALIDATION - The visible size and thickness support this estimate. No extra hidden portion under the cream. The strawberry topping is moderate but not densely packed. Considering slight crumbling of crust, total mass is around 70 grams.

Step 2: Dimension analysis shows the bread slice is about 10 cm long and 5-6 cm wide, a typical small toast slice. The thickness of the bread slice is about 1.5-2 cm, visible from the crumb and crust structure. Step 3: The portion includes bread (dense but aerated), a thin spread of butter (dense), and chestnut cream which is slightly viscous but moderately dense. The spreads cover roughly 80% of the bread surface with a thin layer, appearing to be about 2-3 mm thick on average. Step 4: Typical weight for such a small bread slice alone is approximately 25-30 g. The butter spread might be around 5-7 g (a thin layer), and the chestnut cream slightly more viscous and thicker than butter, about 10-12 g estimated. Step 5: Adding these, the total tartine weight estimate is about 40-45 g, considering visual evidence and standard portion sizes in Switzerland, which often use smaller slices but adequately thick spreads.

Step 3: Density Considerations - Gruyère is a hard Swiss cheese with a density around 1.1 g/cm3, denser than softer cheeses. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Calculating approximate volume: length ~11 cm × width ~2 cm × thickness ~1 cm = 22 cm3. Multiplying by density 1.1 gives about 24 grams. Considering slight estimation error, the weight likely ranges 22-26 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - The cheese slice appears to be a modest single portion without hidden layers and no visible additional pieces. The plate size and other items support this estimate.

There is no extra sauce in a container, only this visible portion. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The visible sauce layer is relatively thin but spread on roughly half the surface area of the meat slice and some on the plate. The roast meat is about 10-12 cm long and 5-6 cm wide. The sauce layer is thin, about 2-3 mm thick on the meat and thin runoff on the plate. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cooked onion sauce has moderate density but mostly liquid with softened onion pieces. Expect density similar to thick broth with vegetable pieces, estimated around 0.9-1 g/cm3. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given the sauce covers around 60% of the meat surface area (~30 sq cm) and is thin, the volume is small. Let's approximate a volume of roughly 30 sq cm × 0.25 cm thickness = 7.5 cm3 of sauce, thus approx 7-8 grams.

I count the individual beans visible, estimating around 30-35 beans in a roughly piled small heap. The depth of the pile is about two layers of beans, so some beans are hidden beneath the top layer. The beans are shiny and plump, indicating they are cooked and hydrated, which adds to their weight. The plate is a standard size with a diameter around 25 cm, which helps contextualize the size of the heap of beans. Each cooked kidney bean typically weighs about 1.2 to 1.5 grams. With around 35 visible beans and accounting for the hidden ones beneath (about 50 in total), the heap visually represents a small to medium portion.

The croissant covers most of the palm width and is about 12-13 cm long. Thickness is visible along the side, typical for a chocolate croissant, with a somewhat dense layered structure. Step 3: Density Considerations - Chocolate croissants are relatively dense pastries with butter and chocolate filling. The scattered nuts increase density slightly. Despite the flaky exterior, the layers and filling usually bring the weight to around 60-80 grams for a typical Swiss-sized portion. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - This croissant looks slightly smaller than a large portion but typical for a medium-sized individual purchase. It has been partially eaten, likely removing about 10-15 grams worth of pastry. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Considering the hand size, the visible volume, and typical density, a full croissant au chocolat of this size usually weighs around 70 grams.

The tuna chunks appear moderately dense and occupy about 25-30% of the volume seen (mixed with couscous and cucumber). The visible tuna pieces look roughly 1-2 cm in size, shredded but still substantial. Step 3: Density Considerations - Tuna is dense and compact. Given it is mixed with lighter couscous and cucumber, the visible quantity of tuna will be a smaller fraction of the total volume but still significant in weight. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The total mixed dish looks like a meal for 1 to 2 persons. The tuna portion visible seems medium, neither scarce nor abundant. Estimating approximately 100-140 grams of tuna in this serving, leaning toward the middle of this range due to moderate coverage and density.

The muesli appears to cover about three-quarters of the bowl's surface area, with some yogurt peeking out. The depth of muesli is roughly estimated by the bowl height and layering; it looks like a single layer, roughly 1.5 to 2 cm thick. Muesli density is moderate—grain mixtures with oats and small flakes tend to weigh around 0.4-0.5 grams per cubic centimeter. Assuming the bowl is filled to about 60-70% of its volume with muesli, the estimated volume for muesli is roughly 250-300 milliliters. Multiplying this volume by density (0.45 g/ml), the weight is approximately 110-135 grams. Considering a medium portion with no visible heavy compacting, I select the middle range.

Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each pineapple piece appears roughly triangular with a base around 4-5 cm and height about 4 cm, thickness near 2-3 cm according to the visible side profile and typical pineapple texture. Step 3: Density Considerations - Pineapple is a moderately dense fruit, mostly water with some fibrous material. Typical pineapple chunk density is close to 0.95-1 g/cm³. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given the number and sizes, this is a medium portion. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The cumulative volume of these chunks approximates about 300-350 cm³, equating roughly to 300-350 g.

The thickness of the cheese slices appears to be about 2-3 mm. Step 3: Cheese is a dense food, so its weight is relatively high for its visible volume. Step 4: Considering the density of semi-hard cheese (~1.1 g/cm3), and estimating each slice's volume roughly: length (6 cm) × width (1.3 cm average) × thickness (0.25 cm) = 1.95 cm3 per slice. For 7 slices, volume = 1.95 × 7 = 13.65 cm3. Weight = volume × density ≈ 13.65 × 1.1 = ~15 grams. Step 5: Adjusting visually for overlap and slight variation in slice size, the cheese likely weighs around 15 grams. This matches a small-to-medium portion typical in Swiss contexts.

Each slice appears about 3-4 cm long, about 1.5-2 cm wide, and around 1 cm thick. There are about 15-18 pieces visible. Estimating the total volume of kiwi pieces, considering they are slightly overlapping but no large hidden piles beneath, gives roughly the volume of one medium kiwi fruit. STEP 3: DENSITY CONSIDERATIONS - Kiwi fruit is moderately dense, about 0.9 g/cm3. A medium kiwi (without skin) usually weighs around 75-90 grams. Since this is peeled and cut kiwi, the weight seen corresponds closely to edible portion weight. STEP 4: PORTION SIZE CALIBRATION - The amount of kiwi visually corresponds to about one medium-sized kiwi fruit, so a typical portion weight of 75 grams is a reasonable estimate.

There are seven visible tomato slices and seven mozzarella slices, layered alternately on a plate. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each slice of tomato appears to be about 0.7-1 cm thick, typical of a fresh tomato slice. The mozzarella slices have roughly the same thickness. Lengthwise, the entire stack is about the length of a small to medium tomato, approximately 12-14 cm. Width is around 5-6 cm. Depth is roughly the combined thickness of the slices stacked, about 1.5-2 cm thick total considering slight overlap and stacking. Step 3: Density Considerations - Tomato is mostly water, relatively light, while mozzarella cheese is denser and heavier. Mozzarella slices appear fresh and dense, typical of fresh mozzarella. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - With 7 slices each, approximate weight for tomato: about 15-20 grams per slice considering tomato density and moisture, totaling around 105-140g; for mozzarella, fresh mozzarella slices about 20-25 grams each, totaling approximately 140-175g. The mozzarella slices seem slightly thicker and denser than tomato slices. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Combining tomato (~120g average) and mozzarella (~160g average) gives an estimated total weight of approximately 280 grams for the whole \\\"délice tomate mozzarella\\\" dish. This aligns realistically with Swiss portion sizing for a fresh tomato-mozzarella salad dish. The balsamic vinegar and herbs add negligible weight.

The salad appears shredded and loosely packed, so depth is moderate and there seems to be no hidden layers beneath. Step 3: Density Considerations - Celery salad is a light, shredded vegetable mix, mainly fibrous and with moderate moisture, so it is lighter per volume than dense foods but heavier than leafy vegetables. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - For this medium mound of shredded celery salad, typical Swiss portion sizes for such a salad range from 50g (small) to 90g (large).

Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The portion is small, consistent with a single serving spoon dollop, fitting the lower-medium portion range. This supports the 6-8 grams range. Step 5: Cross Validation - Given no obvious spill or extra depth, and the visual comparison to the banana slice and oats, this is consistent with typical peanut butter spoonful portion sizes in Swiss contexts.

Since it is a liquid, weight estimation is fairly straightforward: 1 ml of water-based liquid roughly weighs 1 gram. The bottle appears mostly full but with some liquid consumed, estimating around 200 ml remain. Thus, the estimated weight of the tonic liquid (excluding the bottle weight as per instructions) is about 200 grams.

The avocado is visible as two slices placed on the upper right part of the galette wrap. There appear to be about 2-3 medium-sized slices covering roughly one-third of a typical avocado half. STEP 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS - The galette wrap is a standard size, approximately 20-22 cm in diameter based on the plate and fork size. Each avocado slice looks about 7-8 cm long and about 2-3 cm wide, with a thickness about 1 cm. The total visible avocado volume corresponds approximately to half of an average avocado half. STEP 3: DENSITY CONSIDERATIONS - Avocado flesh density is roughly 0.96 g/cm3. Given the visible quantity matches about half an avocado half, this suggests about a quarter of a whole avocado. STEP 4: PORTION SIZE CALIBRATION - A medium avocado weighs approximately 150 grams whole. Half of it would be about 75 grams. The avocado portion here is about half of the half, or roughly 35-40 grams. This aligns with the visual volume and density.

On the plate, there are four discernible cheese slices grouped together on the left side. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each slice appears roughly similar in size to a standard thin slice of cheese, slightly irregular but roughly 5-6 cm in length and 2.5-3 cm in width. The thickness of each slice looks about 3-5 mm, somewhat consistent with typical cheese slices served with bread. Compared to the slice of bread nearby (roughly half a normal bread slice for portion reference), the cheese slices take up a similar surface area to the bread slice. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cheese is dense, so the slices might weigh more than what their surface area alone might suggest. Typical semi-hard cheeses like manchego or gruyère weigh around 3-4 grams per cm² at this thickness. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - These are moderate thin slices (not thick chunks), so each slice might weigh approximately 10-15 grams based on size and density. Since there are 4 slices, total weight likely 40-60 grams. Given the visual thickness and density, 50 grams is a reasonable middle estimate. Step 5: Cross Validation - The quantity aligns with a typical Swiss portion for a cheese appetizer, matching the visual size and number of slices without over or underestimating volume.

Mushroom pieces appear average size (~2-3 cm each), embedded in cream. The sauce thickness is moderate, likely about 5-7 mm coating the pasta, with sauce pooling in some folds. Step 3: Density Considerations - The sauce contains cream (dense and fatty) plus cooked mushrooms (dense). Cream sauce significantly adds to weight, and mushroom pieces are heavy versus volume. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Considering pasta portion size and visible sauce coverage, the sauce portion is medium sized, roughly covering half the bowl volume but only the sauce and mushrooms weigh in the estimation. Step 5: Cross-validation - Typical creamy mushroom sauce portions for this pasta amount range between 80-120 grams. The mushrooms themselves likely weigh around 40-50 grams, with cream complementing to reach the total. Given the creamy texture and mushroom quantity, a realistic estimate is about 100 grams for the mushroom sauce portion visible in the bowl, excluding pasta and courgettes.

The scoop appears to be a standard small ice cream ball. Compared to the size of the bowl (a medium dessert bowl) and knowing typical Swiss dessert portions, the diameter of the scoop seems about 4-5 cm. This corresponds to a small ice cream scoop size. STEP 3: Density considerations. Ice cream is less dense than water, typically around 0.5-0.6 g/ml due to air incorporation. A 4.5 cm diameter sphere has volume ~ (4/3) * π * (2.25)^3 ≈ 47.7 cm³. At density ~0.55 g/cm³, weight ≈ 26 grams. STEP 4: Portion size calibration: The scoop size looks to be a small to medium portion, consistent with Swiss portions.

In Swiss servings, a typical yogurt serving ranges from 100-150g. Here, the yogurt is mixed with cereals and fruit, so the yogurt amount is less than the full bowl content. Step 3: Density Considerations — Yogurt is dense but watery compared to cereals; it contributes significantly to the weight.

The entire visible amount corresponds to roughly the area occupied by the mashed potatoes and meat, plus some extra on the plate outside these items. Considering the plate size (standard dinner plate), the spread sauce layer is thin but consistent in thickness, approximately 2-3 mm thick in depth over the area.

STEP 4: Approximate volume of cereal layer: area ~pi*(7.5 cm)^2 ≈ 176 cm2; thickness ~2.5 cm, volume ≈ 440 cm3. Since cereal is not packed, actual solid cereal volume is less; assume 40% of volume is cereal solids (due to air spaces), which is about 176 cm3. STEP 5: Given cereal density ~0.3 g/cm3, weight = 176 * 0.3 ≈ 53 g. This matches a typical small to medium cereal portion in Swiss context. No visible large clumps or extra layers hidden. STEP 6: Cross-validation: Considering the thin spread and visual portion in the bowl compared to spoon, it’s reasonable to estimate around 50 g. Therefore, final estimated weight for \\\"céréales\\\" is 53 grams.\",\"céréales\":53}",

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is 'yogourt chocolat' which translates to chocolate yogurt. In the image, there is a single transparent bowl that contains a smooth, creamy mixture of chocolate yogurt. There is no distinction of separate pieces; it's a single serving of a creamy food. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The bowl size can be estimated relative to the texture and the standard size of similar clear bowls typically used for small dessert servings. Judging by the curvature and size in relation to the visible texture, the volume seems to be approximately half a small dessert bowl, roughly 150–200 ml in volume. Assuming yogurt density close to water (~1 g/ml), this would translate near 150–200 grams. The yogurt appears thick rather than watery, so actual weight might be slightly higher, but not substantially so. Step 3: Density Considerations - Yogurt is dense and creamy; chocolate flavoring does not add much weight. So 1 ml roughly equals 1 gram. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - This portion looks medium-sized, not a small spoonful or a full large container, but consistent with a single portion eaten as a dessert or snack. Step 5: Cross-validation - The amount does not fill the bowl completely, about 60–70% filled. Assuming the bowl could hold 250–300 grams, 60% fill would be around 150–180 grams.

It appears to be roughly 6-7 cm long, about 2.5-3 cm wide at its thickest part, and has an estimated thickness of about 1.5-2 cm. Step 3, density considerations: Avocado has a medium density due to its creamy texture, but it is fairly dense overall. Step 4, portion size calibration: The slice looks like a medium portion from a half avocado, roughly one-quarter to one-third of a full avocado. Average weight of a full avocado is about 150-200 grams; therefore, this portion likely weighs between 40-60 grams. Step 5, cross-validation: The slice is neither very thin nor extremely thick, so a mid-range estimate around 50 grams is reasonable and consistent with the visible size and typical Swiss portion sizes.

Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each piece is roughly 2 to 3 cm in length and appears quite thick (cubed sausages). Considering the size of the plate which seems a standard dinner plate (approx 25 cm diameter), and the volume of cervelas mixed in the chili, there may be some more pieces partially hidden underneath. The cervelas pieces appear chunky but not densely compacted together; roughly about 2 layers deep underwater by sauce. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cervelas is a type of sausage, moderately dense and fatty. The density can be approximated close to 1 g/cm3. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Each piece could weigh roughly 15 to 20 grams given the size (3 cm cubes). With approximately 10-12 pieces visible plus some hidden in the sauce, total pieces may be about 15. Thus, the weight range estimate is between 225 g (15×15) and 300 g (15×20).

Step 3: Density considerations - Cheese from sheep/goat milk is moderately dense, around 1.0 to 1.1 g/cm³. Step 4: Portion size calibration - Given the size, together these two pieces are a small portion.

The thickness/height looks to be approximately 2-3 cm due to the folded dough wrapping. The gyozas are pan-fried, which gives some density but they are mostly composed of thin dough and vegetables inside, so not overly dense. Step 3: Density Considerations - Vegetarian gyoza fillings typically have a density between cooked vegetables and some moisture content. The weight per piece is generally around 30-40 grams based on standard gyoza portion sizes in Swiss contexts. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - These gyozas look of normal size, neither very small nor large, so a medium portion size estimation is appropriate. Given 3 pieces, each roughly 35 grams as a middle estimate is plausible. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Multiplying 3 pieces by about 35 grams each results in approximately 105 grams total.

Using the plate diameter as a reference (standard plate ~24 cm diameter), the corn pile covers approximately 6-7 cm in width and length, with some depth. Depth can be approximated at about 1 cm, considering the corn kernels are piled loosely. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cooked or canned corn kernels have moderate density, roughly 0.7 to 0.9 grams per cm³; kernels are small and dense but not heavy like meat. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The visible corn portion is small to medium-sized compared to typical Swiss servings. Step 5: Estimation calculation - Volume ≈ 6 cm × 4 cm × 1 cm = 24 cm³. Estimating density at about 0.75 g/cm³, weight ≈ 24 × 0.75 = 18 grams. Given some small gaps in the pile and the size approximation, rounding to about 20 grams is reasonable for this portion.

Step 5: Cross-validation: Considering the size of the plate (standard size) and comparing the beetroot portion to the quinoa portion, the beetroot appears smaller in volume but dense. I estimate around 80 to 110 grams of cooked beetroot here, with a medium portion leaning towards 95 grams. Therefore, the best estimate based on visual cues and density for this beetroot portion is about 95 grams.\",\n  \"betterave\": 95\n}",
    "95": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. STEP 1: The target food item is 'porridge salé' contained in a small glass jar with a metal lid. The porridge fills approximately 75-80% of the jar volume. STEP 2: The jar is relatively small, likely about 200 ml total volume based on typical small jam jar sizes and the diameter indicated on the lid (70 mm). The porridge is quite thick and dense, filling most of the jar but not completely to the top. Its texture looks like cooked oats, dense and compact. STEP 3: Considering the density of cooked porridge (water absorbed oats), typical density is close to water, roughly 1 g/ml. Since the jar is about 200 ml and the porridge fills about 150 ml of that volume, the weight should be about 150 grams. STEP 4: The portion appears medium-sized for a single-serving porridge in Swiss context. STEP 5: Cross-checking with typical porridge servings, around 150 grams is reasonable for this size and consistency. No container weight is included. Therefore, the best estimate for the 'porridge salé' weight in this jar is 150 grams.\",\n  \"porridge salé\": 150\n}",

Step 1: The target food is \\\"cereales\\\" present in a white bowl partially filled with milk. The cereal pieces are clusters mixed with some chocolate chunks. Step 2: The bowl size and spoon provide a reference; the bowl is medium size, and the spoon is standard teaspoon. The cereal clusters mostly sit on the surface of the milk, with some pieces partially submerged, indicating some of the cereal is saturated but not fully absorbed. The clusters vary in size, average cluster about 2-3 cm across. The cereal depth visible is roughly 1-1.5 cm thick, considering the clusters pile but not deeply layered. Step 3: Cereals like granola clusters are dense due to compact oats and added nuts/sugar; density roughly 0.3-0.5 g/cm3. Step 4: Volume estimation - the cereal covers about 60-70% of the milk surface at average depth ~1 to 1.5 cm. Given a bowl diameter around 15 cm, surface area ~175 cm2. Cereal volume = 175 * 1.2 cm (average depth) * 0.65 (area coverage) ≈ 136 cm3. Using density ~0.4 g/cm3, weight ≈ 136*0.4 = 54 grams. Step 5: Cross-check with typical cereal portions which are around 30-50g for small to medium bowl servings; this seems like a medium portion given the visible amount. The chocolate chunks add slight extra weight but are included as part of the cereal mix. Final estimation: about 50 grams of cereal. This excludes the milk weight as instructed.\",\n  \"cereales\": 50\n}",

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food item is one round slice (rondelle) of lemon floating on the surface of water in a glass. There is only one slice present. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The lemon slice roughly corresponds to the diameter of a typical drinking glass top, estimated at about 6-7 cm in diameter. The slice thickness appears standard, about 3-4 mm based on the visible cross-section and typical lemon slice size. Step 3: Density Considerations - Lemon slices contain mostly water, pulp, membranes, and peel, with moderate density close to water but slightly higher due to pulp and peel weight. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - A single lemon slice of this size and thickness typically weighs around 8 to 12 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - Considering the slice is floating and appears fresh, with typical density and visual thickness, a medium portion weight estimate around 10 grams is reasonable and consistent with the size of the slice in the glass. Therefore, the estimated weight of the lemon slice is 10 grams.\",\n  \"rondelle de citron\": 10\n}",

Step 2: Visually, the fried egg occupies about a standard size for a single egg on a plate roughly 23 cm in diameter. The fried egg is fully visible with a typical round white base and a centered yolk. Step 3: Considering typical fried egg dimensions, the white spreads thinly up to about 10-12 cm in diameter, with thickness averaging around 0.3-0.5 cm. Step 4: Density of cooked egg is relatively high due to coagulated proteins; a whole large egg weighs around 50-60 g raw, and cooked weight is similar as water loss is minimal. Step 5: Since the egg is fully cooked and intact without removing any pieces, and visually normal size, we estimate it as a single standard egg portion. Step 6: Typical Swiss portion for one fried egg aligns closely with 50 g to 60 g.

The plate and surrounding objects (such as a cup handle) provide size references for scale. Step 3: Density Considerations - Chocolate fondant is a dense, rich cake with butter, sugar, and chocolate, likely quite dense compared to lighter cakes. The dense texture and relatively thick slice increase weight. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - In Swiss portions, this size of slice is typical, neither very small nor large, thus a medium portion. Step 5: Cross-validation - The visible thickness and density suggest a weight between 120 to 160 grams. Given the slice dimensions and density, an estimate at the middle of this range is appropriate.
