The slices are relatively thick and appear to be piled on top of each other, covering most of the container's surface. Based on the size of the container and the visible thickness of the slices, the total volume of the kohlrabi can be estimated. Kohlrabi is a dense vegetable, so its weight is relatively high compared to its volume. Considering the size and density, I estimate the weight of the kohlrabi slices to be approximately 250 grams.\",\n\t\"colrave crue\": 250  \n}",
    "99": "{\n\t\"reasoning\": \"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'épinards frais' (fresh spinach). In the image, the spinach leaves are spread across the bottom of the bowl and form the base of the salad. The leaves are fresh and not densely packed, which means they have a low density. Based on the visible volume of spinach in the bowl, I estimate the weight to be approximately 50 grams. This accounts for the fact that spinach is lightweight and the portion is moderate in size.\",\n\t\"épinards frais\": 50\n}"
