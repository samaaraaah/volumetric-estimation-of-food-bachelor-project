The salade de pâtes (pasta salad) is visible on the bottom left side of the plate, consisting of spiral pasta mixed with some vegetables like corn, tomato, and cucumber. Considering the pasta is cooked and part of a salad, the portion covers a small area which seems to correspond roughly to about 1 small handful. Swiss typical cooked pasta portions range between 180-250g per serving, but this portion is smaller than a full serving. Visual estimation considering pasta size, density, and accompanying vegetables suggests a weight range of about 90 to 130 grams for this portion. A middle estimate of about 110 grams is appropriate here.\",\n  \"salade de pâtes\": 110\n}",

The tart slice has a visible thin, crumbly crust, a layer of cream filling, and several whole or halved strawberries on top, along with a few red currants. The size of the slice appears to be a typical single portion, approximately a quarter or a sixth of a full tart. The strawberries look fresh and quite dense, and the cream layer is of moderate thickness. The crust is thin but adds some weight. Considering the visible volume and density of the ingredients and comparing with typical Swiss dessert portion sizes, a strawberry tart slice usually weighs between 120 and 180 grams. Given this slice's size and visible ingredients, a reasonable weight range is 130-170 grams, with a midpoint estimate around 150 grams. This estimate accounts for the dense strawberries, creamy filling, and pastry base, and is consistent with the visual context of the plate and typical Swiss dessert portions.\",\n  \"tarte aux fraises\": 150\n}",

The specified food item is 'huile de lin' (linseed oil), which is a liquid and typically used as a dressing or finishing oil. In the image, there is no visible separate container or distinct puddle of oil on the plate, so the linseed oil must have been used in a small amount, likely drizzled or mixed into the other components rather than served as a standalone portion. Given typical usage, the amount of linseed oil consumed in such a meal is generally around 5 to 15 grams for flavor and health benefits, rarely more. Considering the size of the plate and portions of other foods visible, it is plausible that about one tablespoon (roughly 12-13 grams) of linseed oil was used. Therefore, I estimate the weight of 'huile de lin' in the dish to be approximately 12 grams.\",\n  \"huile de lin\": 12\n}",

The image shows a single slice of rhubarb tart on a standard-sized plate (approximately 25 cm diameter). The slice covers a moderate portion of the plate and has a typical thickness for a tart, roughly 2-3 cm. Rhubarb is relatively light but the crust adds some weight. Based on the visible size and the fact that Swiss dessert portions tend to be moderate, a typical single slice of tart weighs between 120 and 160 grams. Choosing a midpoint closer to 140 grams fits well with the observed size and density. This estimate is consistent with the portion size relative to the fork and knife for scale.\",\n  \"tarte à la rhubarbe\": 140\n}",

The poivron (red bell pepper) in the image is sliced into strips and is placed near the bottom center of the plate. The portion shows around 7-8 visible strips, filling a small area on the plate but not piled thickly. Considering the size of the slices relative to the chicken pieces and the avocado slices nearby, the overall volume of the poivron is moderate. Cooked bell pepper has a relatively low density, so the weight is lower than it might appear visually. Typical cooked bell pepper servings range in the 100-150g area, but here the portion is less than a full pepper due to its size and the number of pieces. Therefore, I estimate the poivron portion to be in a range between 80 to 110 grams, picking a midpoint near 95 grams as the best estimate. This aligns well with the portion size visible, and is consistent with the relative size of the other food items on the plate.\",\n  \"poivron\": 95\n}",

The muesli appears to consist of large granola-like clusters, filling the bowl almost to the top. Considering the size of the bowl relative to the square dish and the table surface, and the low density typical of dry muesli, the volume is moderate but not heavy. Typically, a Swiss serving of muesli dry weight is about 40-60 grams for a breakfast portion. Given the reasonably full bowl with chunky clusters that create air gaps, I estimate the muesli's weight between 50 and 65 grams, choosing a midpoint estimate of 57 grams to reflect the dense clusters without overestimating.\",\n  \"muesli nature\": 57\n}",

The tomatoes appear fresh and juicy, cut into wedges and slices, roughly filling the bowl but not piling up excessively. Considering the size of the plate and the typical density of tomatoes (which contain a lot of water), the overall volume corresponds to a portion typical for a single serving salad. The sprinkled flax seeds and the dressing do not add much weight, so they can be disregarded in the tomato weight estimation. Based on typical Swiss portion sizes for vegetable salads between 200 and 300 grams, and given the moderate fullness of the dish, a slightly lower estimate within this range is suitable. I estimate the weight of the 'salade de tomates' to be between 210 and 260 grams, with a midpoint of about 235 grams.\",\n  \"salade de tomates\": 235\n}",

Cheese density varies, but firm cheeses generally weigh about 15-20 grams per cube of this size. Given the size and number of cubes, the total weight is likely between 60 and 90 grams. The midpoint estimate would be around 75 grams, which fits well with the visual portion on the plate compared to the eggs and lettuce volume.

Given the size of the bowl and the other items as references (spinach leaves and cherry tomatoes), the sprouts amount appears to be a small handful covering an area of about half the bowl's center. Typically, sprouts weigh around 20-40 grams per serving depending on volume. Here the quantity looks moderate but not heavily piled. I estimate a plausible weight range between 25 and 40 grams. Choosing a midpoint, the sprouts weigh approximately 32 grams. This fits well with the visible volume and the typical Swiss portion sizes for such fresh sprouts.\",\n  \"pousses de graines\": 32\n}",

The size of the container relative to the apple confirms it is a common single serving yogurt pot. Since the yogurt is plain and dense, I estimate the weight of the 'yaourt nature' to be close to 150 grams. The plausible range would be about 125-150 grams, with 150 grams as the midpoint estimate consistent with typical Swiss portion sizes.\",\n  \"yaourt nature\": 150\n}",

Considering the softness and moisture content of cooked courgettes and onions, they are low in density but have some volume. Comparing their size to the millet patties on the right side, which are denser and more compact, the vegetable portion is volumetrically comparable but lighter. Swiss cooked vegetable portions usually range between 200-300g. Given the volume and visible moisture, I estimate the courgette et oignons to weigh between 210-260 grams. The midpoint, a reasonable estimation, would therefore be around 235 grams, aligning well with typical veggie portions and the visible amount in the container.\",\n  \"courgette et oignons\": 235\n}",

Given that millet and beans are dense ingredients, and the patties seem compact with visible corn and black bean pieces, each galette can be estimated to weigh around 45-55 grams. Five galettes together would therefore weigh around 225-275 grams in total.

The pasta is located on the right side of the container and is fusilli type with a tomato sauce and a generous amount of grated Parmesan on top. The pasta portion visually occupies about one-third of the container's volume. Considering the typical portion size for cooked pasta in Switzerland is around 180-250g, and noting this pasta portion appears moderate in size but quite dense, I estimate the minimum-maximum plausible range to be 160-220 grams. The midpoint of this range, around 190 grams, seems to best reflect the amount given visible density and container size. This estimate is consistent with the relative volume of the chicken and green beans portions in the same container, which seem similar in quantity but meat portions are typically lighter in weight compared to volume. Therefore, the estimated pasta weight is 190 grams.\",\n  \"pâtes\": 190\n}",

The salad is placed on the right side of the plate and appears to be primarily leafy greens with some other small vegetable pieces mixed in. The portion size is relatively small, covering a small area of the plate, and the volume is modest given the leafy nature of the salad. Considering Swiss salad portion size ranges of 250-400g for a full serving, this salad appears to be less than a full serving, approximately one quarter to one third of that. Visually, it looks to weigh approximately between 60g to 110g. A reasonable midpoint estimate given the volume and the nature of the leafy vegetables on the plate is around 85 grams.

The vegetables are chopped and cooked, including strips of carrots and pieces of leek. The portion occupies roughly one quarter of a standard medium-sized dinner plate, appearing moderately piled but not densely compacted. Carrots and leeks are vegetables with medium density and moderate water content. Swiss portions for cooked vegetables generally range from 200-300 grams. Given the volume and distribution here, the sautéed vegetables look like a typical Swiss portion close to the mid to upper part of that range. A reasonable internal range is 220-280 grams, with a midpoint around 250 grams.

The surface coverage and the volume of the strands suggest a standard Swiss serving of cooked pasta, which is generally between 180-250 grams. Given the portion looks moderate, closer to an average dinner portion rather than a large bowl, an estimated range of 180-210 grams seems reasonable. Considering the spaghetti is not densely packed, I place the estimate near the midpoint at about 195 grams.

Given the porous structure of the bread and the visible size held in hand, a typical slice of pain bis weighs approximately 40-50 grams. Since this is one double slice (two slices side by side), the total weight is likely around 80-100 grams.

Waffles are generally light due to air pockets, but dense enough to give a weight near 80-120g for a single medium piece. Given the size and typical density, the waffle itself likely weighs around 100-110g. The applesauce on top appears as a thin layer, around 15-25g, but since the request is for the waffle only, we exclude it from the estimate. Therefore, estimating the waffle weight alone at about 105g is appropriate, with a plausible range from 90g to 115g to account for thickness and density variations.\",\n  \"gaufre\": 105\n}",

Swiss portion sizes for cooked vegetables like asparagus generally range from 200 to 300 grams per serving. However, given the relatively small number of stalks and their thickness, the portion is on the lighter side. The asparagus are arranged in a single layer and do not appear overly thick or dense. Comparing their size and volume visually to the potatoes (pommes de terre) and ham (jambon cru) slices nearby, these asparagus are likely to weigh between 120 and 160 grams. The mayonnaise serves as a size reference, being a small dollop which supports this moderate portion size estimate.

The small black seeds scattered evenly throughout the mixture are clearly identifiable as graines de chia. Given that the seeds are mixed thoroughly into the creamy mixture and oats, the visible quantity is moderate and spread through the surface and depth of the bowl. Chia seeds are very small and dense, so even a small volume corresponds to a measurable weight. Considering a typical portion of chia seeds added into such a breakfast bowl is around 15-25 grams, and judging by the visible density and volume distribution in the bowl, the amount plausibly aligns closer to about 20 grams.

Considering Swiss cooked pasta servings typically weigh between 120-150 grams, and judging by the volume and density as compared to the other foods on the plate (green beans and kidney beans), the visible pasta portion lies within this range. The pasta portion is substantial, but not overly heaped, so an estimated plausible weight range is 130 to 160 grams.
