Each slice appears to be a standard size for pre-sliced bread, which typically weighs around 25-30 grams per slice. Since there are two slices, the total weight of the toast would be approximately 50-60 grams. Based on the visual cues, I estimate the weight of the toast to be 55 grams.\",\n\t\"toast\": 55\n}",

The tomme de savoie is located on the plate as the cheese piece with a beige rind and a creamy white interior, positioned near the center of the plate. It is a single piece, cut into a wedge shape. Based on its size relative to the other cheeses and the baguette slice, it appears to be a small portion. Tomme de savoie is a semi-soft cheese, so it is denser than soft cheeses like brie but less dense than hard cheeses. Considering its visible dimensions and density, I estimate its weight to be approximately 25 grams.\",\n\t\"tomme de savoie\": 25\n}"
