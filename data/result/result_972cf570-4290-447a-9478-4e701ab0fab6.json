The salad occupies about one-third of the plate's surface area.\\n\\n3. Volume assessment:\\n   The salad pile is roughly 10 cm × 10 cm in area and about 3 cm thick. This gives a volume of approximately 300 cm³ (10 × 10 × 3).\\n\\n4. Density selection:\\n   The salad is a mix of leafy greens (density 0.05–0.1 g/ml), shredded carrots (density 0.4–0.6 g/ml), and avocado (density 0.6–0.8 g/ml). Considering the mix, I estimate an average density of 0.2 g/ml.\\n\\n5. Weight calculation:\\n   Weight = volume × density = 300 cm³ × 0.2 g/ml = 60 g.\\n\\n6. Plausibility check:\\n   The estimated weight of 60 g is reasonable for a small mixed salad portion. It is lighter than a smartphone (≈170 g) and aligns with expectations for the visible portion size.\\n\\n7. Final estimate:\\n   The weight of the salad is approximately 60 g.\",\n  \"salade (salade verte, carottes, avocat, 1cs huile d'olive, 1 cs vinaigre)\": 60\n}",

Reference object: The tray appears to be a standard small rectangular food container, approximately 20 cm × 15 cm. \\n\\n3. Volume assessment: The kohlrabi pieces are spread out on the tray, forming a layer approximately 2 cm thick. The visible area of the tray is about 20 cm × 15 cm = 300 cm².

Choose a physical reference: The bowl appears to be a standard medium-sized salad bowl, approximately 20 cm in diameter. The spinach leaves occupy most of the visible area of the bowl, with other ingredients layered on top.\\n\\n3. Volume assessment: The spinach leaves are loosely packed, covering the bottom of the bowl. Based on the visible portion, the spinach likely occupies about 2/3 of the bowl's depth. Assuming the bowl has a depth of approximately 6 cm, the spinach occupies a volume of about 20 cm (diameter) × 20 cm (diameter) × 4 cm (height) × 0.5 (adjusting for air gaps between leaves) = 800 cm³.\\n\\n4. Density selection: Fresh spinach has a density of approximately 0.05–0.1 g/ml. Using an average density of 0.075 g/ml, the weight of the spinach is estimated as 800 cm³ × 0.075 g/ml = 60 g.\\n\\n5. Plausibility check: The estimated weight of 60 g is reasonable for a medium-sized salad bowl with loosely packed spinach leaves.
