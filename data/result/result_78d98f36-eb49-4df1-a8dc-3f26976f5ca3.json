The salade de pâtes is located at the bottom left quadrant of the plate, consisting of short spiral pasta with visible pieces of vegetables like corn, tomato, and cucumber. The portion occupies a modest area on a standard-sized dinner plate (approximately 24-26 cm in diameter). Given the compact and dense nature of cooked pasta salad, the volume suggests about a medium-sized side portion. Typically, a portion of pasta salad that fits this visible volume weighs between 100 and 130 grams. Considering the presence of vegetables mixed with pasta, which adds some volume but lowers the density slightly, a reasonable estimate near the midpoint is around 115 grams. This fits well with the visual fullness of the portion compared to the other items on the plate, such as the carrot salad and meats.\",\n  \"salade de pâtes\": 115\n}",

The crust appears thin but crisp, and the cream layer is moderately thick but not overly dense. The strawberries are fresh and dense, and the size of the slice suggests about one-eighth of a typical 20-22 cm tart. Considering a typical full strawberry tart weighs roughly 600-700 grams, one slice would reasonably be around 75-90 grams.

There is no visible small pool or bottle of oil on the plate, nor a clear glossy oily surface that would markedly indicate a substantial amount. Given the typical use of linseed oil as a finishing or dressing oil in small quantities (often about 5-10g for flavoring rather than a main ingredient), and the lack of visible oil pooling, it is reasonable to estimate a minimal amount here, approximately one tablespoon or less.

Tomatoes are mostly water and have medium density, about 0.95g/cm³. Considering the thickness and number of tomato slices covering the plate, this portion visually corresponds to about 2 medium-sized tomatoes. A medium tomato weighs approximately 120-150 grams. Two of these would weigh roughly 240-300 grams. Given the plate is fully covered but not heaped, and factoring some spaces between slices, a reasonable weight range is 230 to 280 grams.

Given their size—approximately 6-7 cm in diameter and around 1.5 cm thick—the individual weight of each galette can be estimated. Considering cooked millet and beans have moderate density and some moisture content, each galette likely weighs about 40-50 grams. Multiplying by six galettes gives a plausible total range of 240-300 grams. Estimating near the midpoint, a value of 270 grams seems reasonable.

The quantity of pasta fills roughly one-third of the container's length and covers a surface about half the container's width. The container appears to be a standard medium-sized lunch box around 20 cm long and 13 cm wide. Given the visible amount of pasta and sauce, the volume likely corresponds to about 220-280 grams of cooked pasta with sauce. Accounting for density and sauce absorption, a reasonable estimate of the pasta weight is around 250 grams. The parmesan is not included since it is a separate item.

Considering the density of leafy greens, which is quite low compared to cooked grains like the risotto on the left, the volume of the salad is small, about the size of a handful or less. The plate is large, and the salad occupies only a small fraction of it. Based on typical leafy salad density and visual volume, the salad weighs approximately between 25 and 40 grams. A midpoint estimate near 32 grams is reasonable given the visual cues and density. This estimate excludes any dressing weight as negligible within the salad bulk.\",\n  \"salade\": 32\n}",

Considering that sautéed vegetables lose some water but maintain volume and have a medium density (less dense than rice or fish), a similar volume of sautéed carrots and leeks usually weighs around 90-130 grams. Given the portion size here, which looks moderately generous but not heaped, I estimate the weight is near the midpoint, about 110 grams.

The scrambled eggs likely come from approximately 2 to 3 large eggs based on volume and typical serving sizes. A large egg weighs about 50 grams, but once scrambled and cooked, the total weight would be slightly less due to water loss, although this loss is small. The volume on the plate looks like about 100-150 grams of scrambled eggs. Considering this and the density of cooked eggs, a plausible weight range would be 110 to 140 grams. Selecting the midpoint for precision, I estimate the weight at 125 grams.

Given that these slices are of average thickness and size, and not particularly thin or thick, the weight of one slice can be reasonably estimated around 45 grams. Since the food list and question ask for 'pain bis' (plural), and two slices are shown, the total weight of both slices would be approximately 90 grams.

Meat sauces typically weigh around 1 g per cm³ due to their density (similar to water but slightly higher due to meat and tomato solids). Hence, the weight should be about 50-75 grams. To ensure accuracy, the sauce does not overflow or cover the pasta extensively, which supports a moderate portion size.

Given the visible texture and density of this type of bread, and comparing it to standard slice weights from similar bread types in Switzerland, each slice roughly weighs between 40 and 55 grams. Since the target food is 'pain' (bread), and considering there are two slices present, the total weight of the bread visible is in the 80 to 110 grams range.
