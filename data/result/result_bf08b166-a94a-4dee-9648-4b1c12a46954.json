Considering the size of the bread slice and the spread's thinness, I estimate the weight of the molasses to be approximately 5 grams.\",\n  \"mélasse\": 5\n}",

The salad consists of green lettuce leaves, and it appears to be lightly dressed with some seeds visible. The portion size is moderate, covering about one-third of the plate. The leaves are not densely packed, and lettuce is a low-density food. Based on the visual volume and typical weight of lettuce, I estimate the weight of the salad to be approximately 40 grams.\",\n  \"salade\": 40\n}",

The size of the chocolate branch is approximately the length of the fingers holding it, suggesting it is a standard-sized chocolate branch. These typically weigh around 20-25 grams based on their size and density. The visible thickness and texture of the chocolate confirm it is not overly large or heavy.

The image shows a pizza with toppings of mushrooms (champignons), olives, and zucchini (courgettes). There are five slices of pizza visible, and the pizza appears to be a medium-sized one, with a thin crust and moderate topping coverage. Based on the size of the slices relative to the plate, the pizza's diameter is approximately 28-30 cm. A typical medium pizza of this size weighs around 400-500 grams, including the crust, cheese, and toppings. Given that the pizza is not overly thick or heavily loaded with toppings, I estimate the total weight to be on the lower end of this range. Since the pizza is partially eaten, with about 4/5 of it remaining, the weight of the remaining portion is approximately 400 grams.\",\n  \"pizza champignons, olives, courgettes\": 400\n}",

From the image, the salad occupies a significant portion of the plate, but it is not densely packed. Lettuce is light and voluminous, while carrots and avocado add some density. The visible portion of the salad appears to be about 1.5 cups in volume. Lettuce typically weighs around 15 g per cup, shredded carrots around 50 g per cup, and avocado around 150 g per cup. Considering the mix, the salad likely contains approximately 20 g of lettuce, 30 g of carrots, and 40 g of avocado.

Based on the size of the container and the visible volume of the kohlrabi pieces, I estimate the total weight. Kohlrabi is a dense vegetable, and the pieces appear to be about 1-2 cm thick.
