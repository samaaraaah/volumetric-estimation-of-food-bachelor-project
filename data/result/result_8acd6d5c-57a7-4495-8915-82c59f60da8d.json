Comparing the pasta with the sausage and the duck slices, and noting the plate size and placement, the visible pasta salad portion likely weighs between 70 and 90 grams. The salad is spread in a shallow pile with no deep layering, so the lower end of the range is most plausible. Therefore, the estimated weight of the salade de pâtes is about 80 grams.\",\n  \"salade de pâtes\": 80\n}",

The strawberries are standard-sized, and there are roughly 6-7 halves visible, which corresponds to about 3-4 whole strawberries cut in half. Each whole strawberry generally weighs about 15-20 grams. The creamy filling layer seems moderately thick but not overly dense, likely contributing around 40-50 grams with the crust. The crust portion is thin and crumbly, so likely around 15-20 grams. Considering the visible surface area and estimating the depth, the total weight of the slice looks to be in the range of 110 to 140 grams. Picking a balanced estimate closer to 125 grams accounts for the weight of strawberries, filling, and crust.

Given typical usage and the visual absence of a separate quantity, the amount of linseed oil used is likely small. For dressings or seasoning in a plate of this size, linseed oil would commonly be around 5-10 grams (a teaspoon to two teaspoons). Considering the size of the plate, the visible shine on the vegetables, and typical cooking practices without excessive pooling of oil, I estimate the weight of 'huile de lin' to be about 8 grams, within a plausible range of 5-10 grams.\",\n  \"huile de lin\": 8\n}",

The tart filling is visible as chunks of rhubarb embedded in a custard or cream base with a pastry crust. The depth of the tart from crust to filling looks moderate, around 2 to 2.5 cm thick. Based on typical Swiss tart slices and the visible size relative to the fork, I estimate the weight range to be between 120 grams (thin and lighter filling) and 150 grams (denser filling and crust). A mid value around 135 grams seems reasonable as the slice is not overly thick but well covered with rhubarb. This estimate accounts for the weight of the pastry base and the rhubarb pieces.

Considering the somewhat flat and sliced nature of the poivron, the density is moderate, less dense than meat but more dense than lettuce. Typical cooked red bell pepper density is about 0.9 g/cm³. Estimating that these slices amount visually to around 70-90 cubic centimeters in volume, the weight should be in the range of 60 to 80 grams.

The plate diameter is roughly estimated at 22-24 cm, and the tomato slices cover about three-quarters of this area with some layering visible. Considering the average density and water content of ripe tomatoes, which are quite dense but mostly water, the visible volume suggests a portion around 200-300 grams. The presence of dressing (olive oil and balsamic vinegar) does not significantly add mass to the tomatoes.

Judging by the container size and comparing the courgette and onions pieces with the nearby millet patties (each about 5-6 cm wide), the volume of vegetables is moderate. Cooked zucchini and onions have a lot of water content but retain some density. Taking those factors into account, the total weight of the courgette et oignons portion should be around 110 to 150 grams.

The pasta portion occupies approximately half of the container area, laid flat with a visible depth of about 2-3 cm. Given the container size relative to the food, the pasta portion looks like a single standard cooked serving. Typical cooked pasta servings average between 150 and 180 grams, depending on packing and moisture. Here, the pasta is visible with sauce but not excessively dense or compacted. The grated Parmesan on top does not add much weight to the pasta itself but slightly covers its surface.

Given that lettuce is mostly water and quite light, with some added vegetables increasing density slightly, the total weight is expected to be low. Considering the compactness and volume, the salad should weigh between 25 and 40 grams. Selecting a middle estimate that matches visual density and volume, about 32 grams is plausible.

Comparing their size to the fish portion and the rice, the vegetables form a loose pile approximately 6 cm by 5 cm in area and about 1.5 to 2 cm deep. Given that cooked carrots and leeks are moderately dense but softened, an estimated density of about 0.6 to 0.7 g/cm3 is reasonable. Calculating volume: 6cm x 5cm x 1.75cm = 52.5 cm3 approximately. Multiplying by density yields a weight range of about 31 to 37 grams. Adjusting slightly for the presence of some liquid and slight compression, a plausible range is 30 to 40 grams, with a best estimate around 35 grams.

There is apple compote spread partially over the waffle that does not add to the waffle's weight. A typical rectangular waffle of this size generally weighs between 70 and 90 grams depending on density and moisture.

Using this, the total weight for 7 spears would be within 84 to 105 grams. Considering that these asparagus are medium-sized and cooked, I estimate the total weight near the middle of this range, at approximately 95 grams.

The volume appears somewhat compact but has some air content due to the texture of ice cream. Considering typical density of ice cream is approximately 0.6 to 0.7 g/cm³, and estimating the volume around 120-140 cm³, the weight range would be around 72 to 98 grams. Placing the final estimate closer to the midpoint but slightly cautious about air pockets and possible melting, I estimate the weight at approximately 85 grams.\",\n  \"glace noisette\": 85\n}",

Comparing the apple to the croissant next to it, the apple is roughly similar in height but has a more rounded shape, making its volume comparable or slightly bigger. A medium Swiss apple generally weighs between 150 to 200 grams. The apple here appears fresh, dense, and without visible flaws or cuts, so its weight would be near the midpoint of that range. Given the visual scale and comparison, I estimate the apple to weigh approximately 170 grams, within a plausible range of 150-190 grams.\",\n  \"pomme\": 170\n}",

Comparing the spelt's size to the scrambled eggs and baked eggplant in the container, and considering the container's depth which is about 3-4 cm, the volume of cooked spelt is moderate. Cooked spelt has a density roughly similar to cooked wheat or barley, around 120-140 grams per 100 ml. The visible portion looks like it occupies approximately 150 ml of volume.

The bowl holds a creamy mixture with oats and chia seeds, which makes it difficult to isolate a large volume of seeds. Chia seeds are small and dense, and typically used in small quantities in such preparations. Considering the standard serving size and the visible distribution of chia seeds, the total weight of chia seeds in this bowl is likely between 10 and 15 grams.

Realistically, kitchen portions of butter pieces for spreading tend to range from 1 to 3 grams, so considering the visible size, a plausible weight range is 1.2 to 2.5 grams.
