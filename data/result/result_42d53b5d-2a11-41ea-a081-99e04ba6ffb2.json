Fresh spinach and sprouts are light and airy, with the spinach occupying a significant volume but weighing less, probably 50-100g in total. Cherry tomatoes are dense but small, each roughly 20-25g; with around 8-10 visible, they contribute approximately 200-250g. The falafel, based on their size and density, likely weigh about 20-25g each, and with about 10 pieces, they sum up to roughly 200-250g. Considering their density and the overall visual fullness, the falafel seem to weigh more than a simple guess, but not exceeding necessary limits. The sum of the main visible components suggests the falafel weigh around 200-250g. From the visual perspective, I estimate each falafel to be about 22g on average, totalling approximately 220g. I will select a value around 220 grams as the final estimate, as it reflects the number and size of falafel pieces and aligns with typical portion sizes for this type of dish.\",\n  \"épinards frais\": 75\n}"
