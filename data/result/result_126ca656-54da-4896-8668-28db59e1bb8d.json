The molasses appears to be spread thinly over the buttered bread. Based on the size of the bread slice and the thinness of the spread, the amount of molasses is likely small. A typical thin spread of molasses on a slice of bread like this would weigh approximately 5-10 grams. Considering the visible coverage and the density of molasses, I estimate the weight to be around 7 grams.\",  \n\t\"mélasse\": 7  \n}",

The salad consists of leafy greens, and its volume appears moderate, covering about one-third of the plate. Leafy greens are low in density, so their weight is typically much less than their volume suggests. Based on the visible portion, I estimate the salad to weigh approximately 40 grams, which is consistent with a small to medium portion of salad in a Swiss context. This estimate accounts for the visible leaves and any dressing or seeds that may be present but do not significantly add to the weight.\",\n\t\"salade\": 40  \n}",

The chocolate appears to be partially unwrapped, and its size can be estimated based on the hand holding it. The stick is relatively thin and elongated, with a textured surface indicating nuts or crisped rice. Based on the typical size of such chocolate sticks in Switzerland, they usually weigh between 20-30 grams. Given the visible portion and the standard packaging, I estimate the weight of this chocolate stick to be approximately 25 grams.\",\n\t\"branche de chocolat\": 25\n}",

The image shows a pizza with toppings of mushrooms (champignons), olives, and zucchini (courgettes). There are five slices visible on the plate, and the pizza appears to be a thin-crust style. Based on the size of the slices and the visible toppings, the pizza seems to be medium-sized, approximately 25-30 cm in diameter. A typical medium-sized thin-crust pizza weighs around 300-400 grams, including the crust, cheese, and toppings. Given that this pizza has a moderate amount of toppings and is not overly loaded, I estimate the total weight to be approximately 350 grams. Since the entire pizza is visible, no adjustments for hidden portions are needed.\",\n\t\"pizza champignons, olives, courgettes\": 350\n}",

It consists of lettuce (salade verte), shredded carrots, and pieces of avocado, with a dressing of olive oil and vinegar. The salad appears to be a medium portion, with the lettuce being the most voluminous component. Lettuce is low in density, while carrots and avocado are denser. The dressing (1 tablespoon each of olive oil and vinegar) adds a small amount of weight. Based on the visible volume and typical densities of these ingredients, I estimate the weight of the salad to be approximately 150 grams.\",\n\t\"salade (salade verte, carottes, avocat, 1cs huile d'olive, 1 cs vinaigre)\": 150\n}",

Based on the size of the container and the visible volume of the kohlrabi, I estimate the total weight. Kohlrabi is a dense vegetable, and the slices seem to fill the container to about 80% of its capacity. A container of this size, filled with kohlrabi slices, would typically weigh around 200-250 grams.

Based on the size of the bowl and the visible volume of spinach, I estimate that there are approximately 50-70 grams of fresh spinach. Fresh spinach is lightweight and takes up significant volume, so I will estimate conservatively toward the lower end of this range to account for the loose packing of the leaves.\",\n\t\"épinards frais\": 60\n}"
