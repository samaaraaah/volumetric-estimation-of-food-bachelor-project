The slice is on a standard-sized dessert plate, roughly 12-14 cm diameter, and the piece covers about a quarter of the plate. The biscuit base looks moist but not overly thick, the fruit layer adds some density and moisture, and the cream layer is substantial and thick, covering the entire slice evenly. The visible fresh fruits on top add a small but notable weight. Given that creamy desserts with mascarpone are dense and moist, and considering the size and composition, the reasonable weight range for this portion should be around 90 to 140 grams.

The waffles are cut into quarters, and each piece is roughly the size of a standard waffle square, approximately 7-8 cm per side and fairly thick, indicating a denser, substantial base typical of sweet potato preparation. The total volume visible is moderate but compact, with each piece having some thickness and dense texture. Considering typical densities and the visible size, the total weight of all four pieces combined would likely be around 220-280 grams. Since the request is for the total weight of the waffles alone, excluding toppings, I'll estimate on the slightly higher side due to the density of sweet potato batter compared to normal waffles. This puts the total weight around 250 grams, which is reasonable for a plated sweet potato waffle serving split into four portions. This estimate is consistent with the size and typical density of sweet potato waffles and proportional to the other food items' presence on the plate.\",\n  \"gaufre à la patate douce\": 250\n}",

Considering the container size (roughly 15 cm square), the courgette and onions occupy about half the container volume but are loosely packed. Given their cooked state, vegetables tend to weigh more than their volume suggests due to water content, but the portion is moderate, not piled up. Swiss portion references for cooked vegetables as a side dish range between 120-180g. The portion seems medium-sized but not full or very dense, thus I estimate it around the middle of that range.

Considering the density of mashed potatoes, this looks like a typical side dish portion. The Swiss reference range for vegetable side dishes such as cooked potatoes is 120-180g, with mashed potatoes tending toward the denser end. Comparing the size to the two sizeable carrots (typical carrot segments in the 50-60g range each) and meat chunks, the mashed potatoes appear to be a medium-sized portion. Taking into account the thickness and volume, I estimate the mashed potatoes weigh approximately 140-160 grams.

From the visible blueberries, I count approximately 12 whole blueberries. A typical medium-sized blueberry weighs about 1.3 to 1.5 grams. Considering some variation and small sizes, the visible portion of blueberries likely weighs between 15 and 20 grams. This seems consistent with the size of the bowl and the portions of other toppings. Given the blueberries are fresh and dense but small, a final estimate around the midpoint of that range is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the myrtilles to be about 17 grams.\",\n  \"myrtilles\": 17\n}",

The image shows a dessert plate with two pieces of cake: one tiramisu and one forêt noir. The tiramisu piece is roughly the size of a medium slice of cake, about 10 cm in length, 4 cm wide, and around 3-4 cm thick. Tiramisu is a layered dessert composed of soaked sponge and creamy mascarpone layers, which makes it relatively dense compared to dry cake. A typical single portion weighs between 100 and 150 grams. Given the relatively generous thickness and the visible cream layering, I estimate the piece to be slightly above a standard slice but not large overall. The tiramisu appears to be a medium-sized portion rather than a small or very large slice. Therefore, considering density and the visible size, the weight is likely around 140 grams. This is plausible relative to the forêt noir slice on the plate and the plate size. The estimation matches typical portion sizes for tiramisu and fits with the visual evidence without being underestimated.\",\n  \"tiramisu\": 140\n}",

The pasta shapes are penne and conchiglie, mixed with some pancetta or bacon pieces. The pasta portion seems to cover about half the plate's center area with some thickness, estimated to be between 200-250g of cooked pasta. The cheese portion on top is finely grated, piled moderately but not overflowing. A typical serving of grated cheese added on pasta usually ranges around 15-25g. Considering the density and typical portion size of grated gruyère cheese and comparing it visually to the pasta volume, it is reasonable to estimate the cheese quantity at approximately 20 grams. This fits well with the visual scale relative to the pasta and plate size. Therefore, the estimated weight of the gruyère is 20 grams.\",\n  \"gruyère\": 20\n}",

The wrap itself looks thin and of a standard diameter about 25 cm typical for galette wraps. Galette wraps are generally light, weighing between 50 to 70 grams. Given the visual thickness and appearance, this galette wrap appears to be an average size and thickness without obvious extra density or unusual thickness. Thus, the weight closest to a standard portion is around 65 grams, consistent with typical Swiss galette wraps.\",\n  \"galette wraps\": 65\n}",

The tart slice contains visible fresh strawberries on top, a creamy filling layer below, and a thin crust base, some of which has crumbled on the plate. The strawberries are medium size and appear to be halved or quartered, with about 7-8 pieces on the slice. Considering the density of fresh strawberries (roughly 15-20g each for the pieces shown), the total strawberry weight would be around 110-140g. The creamy filling and crust are present but seem light in volume and thickness, suggesting an additional 40-60g. Given this is a single slice and not a whole tart, the total slice weight is plausibly between 150 and 200g. Since the question focuses on the 'tarte aux fraises' as a whole food item in the image (including crust, cream, and fruit), I estimate the weight of this slice as approximately 180 grams. This estimate fits with the visible amount, size of pieces, texture, and typical portion size for a tart slice.\",\n  \"tarte aux fraises\": 180\n}",

The image shows a single tartine (slice of bread) with a spread of crème de marrons and butter on it, placed on a white plate. The tartine is relatively small, roughly the size of a standard slice of artisan bread. Bread slices of this size typically weigh between 25 and 35 grams. The butter and crème de marrons appear to be spread moderately, covering most of the surface but not thickly piled. Considering typical spreads, butter added might be around 5-7 grams, and the crème de marrons spread would likely be around 10-15 grams, given its texture and coverage. Combined, these spreads add about 15-22 grams to the base bread weight. Therefore, the total weight of this tartine with spread should be roughly 40-55 grams. Selecting a medium value within this range, I estimate the tartine avec crème de marrons et beurre weighs about 48 grams.\",\n  \"tartine avec crème de marrons et beurre\": 48\n}",

The 'bout de gruyère' is a single rectangular slice of cheese positioned in the middle of the plate. It appears to be about 12-14 cm long, 2.5-3 cm wide, and roughly 1-1.2 cm thick. Gruyère is a dense cheese, so the volume to weight ratio is fairly high. Visual comparison to the adjoining foods (carrot sticks, apple slices, charcuterie) confirms this piece is quite substantial in size relative to a single serving slice. Considering typical densities of gruyère cheese and its measured dimensions, a piece of that size generally weighs around 45-55 grams. I estimate it to be closer to the mid-upper part of that range due to its visible thickness and solid form. The Swiss usual portion for cheese fragments can vary but typically ranges around 40-60g for a substantial piece.

Visually, the sauce is spread thinly over the meat and also some pools around it, covering a small surface area. Onion sauces are usually dense but the visible amount here seems moderate – not a large puddle or thick layer. Considering the size of the roast slice as a reference, which is about the size of an average meat serving slice (roughly 120-180g), the sauce layer is fairly thin but has some volume accumulated in the liquid and visible onions. Given this, the sauce likely weighs between 30 and 50 grams. Since the quantity is moderate and not overly abundant, I estimate the sauce oignons weight to be around 40 grams. This fits within plausible density and volume expectations and is consistent with the size of the other portions on the plate, where side sauces typically range around this weight.\",\n  \"sauce oignons\": 40\n}",

The target food item is 'haricots rouges' (red kidney beans) located on the left side of the plate. The portion consists of a medium pile of cooked red kidney beans, appearing moist and slightly shiny, suggesting they are cooked and seasoned lightly. Visually, the amount covers roughly a quarter of the plate surface, with visible whole beans. Red kidney beans are dense and heavy foods, so their weight is considerable for the visual volume. Comparing to the pasta and green beans nearby, which are standard side dish portions, the portion size looks moderate. Swiss reference portion for legume dishes is 180-250g typically for a main dish, but here it is likely a side dish so slightly smaller. Considering this, and the dense nature of kidney beans, I estimate the weight in a range around 130-180g. Given the moderate pile and the visual density, the final estimate leans towards the upper-mid range to avoid underestimation, at about 165 grams.\",\n  \"haricots rouges\": 165\n}",

The image shows a rectangular plastic container partly filled with a Greek salad consisting of diced cucumbers, tomatoes, yellow peppers, onions, olives, and some crumbled white cheese (likely feta). The salad pieces are finely diced and densely packed, which increases the overall density compared to leafy salads. Given the container size relative to the table and the visible volume of salad filling the container about halfway, the portion appears moderate but not large. Swiss portion size for dense mixed salads like Greek salad is typically 200-300g for a main portion. This container is smaller than a typical main plate portion but sufficiently filled to suggest a medium portion, possibly a side or small main. Considering the density and volume visible and the distribution, an estimate of around 180-220g seems appropriate. To avoid underestimation common with dense salads, I will select a value slightly above the middle of this range.

It appears to be fairly thick with visible large chunks of chocolate embedded in it, indicating a denser dough. A standard homemade or bakery-style chocolate chip cookie of this size and density typically weighs between 40 to 60 grams.

There is a visible bite taken from one corner, which lets us see the flaky interior typical of this pastry. The croissant seems fairly dense, as these pastries are buttery and layered. Standard croissant au chocolat sizes in Switzerland typically range between 65-125 grams depending on size and filling. Given the visible size relative to the hand and the fact this croissant has chocolate filling (usually increasing the weight slightly), and considering that it is not very small or overly large, I estimate it to be around 90-100 grams.

The item is a puff pastry, which is light and flaky, combined with a moderate amount of tomato sauce which adds some moisture and density. A typical small puff pastry bite with sauce like this generally weighs between 25 and 40 grams depending on thickness and filling.

Mozzarella balls of this size are usually around 100-125 grams depending on density and moisture content. Given its intact and fresh appearance, I estimate it close to the middle of that range. The olives and salad on the plate help provide scale, confirming that this is a standard-sized ball. Swiss portions for mozzarella as part of a salad or appetizer are generally around 100-125 grams.

Typical weight for a slice of this type of bread is between 35 and 50 grams depending on thickness and density. These slices look medium-thick and dense enough to estimate towards the upper middle of this range. Considering there is no visible cut in thickness or missing parts, the weight per slice of bread is likely around 45 grams. Since the food label specifies only 'pain' (bread) and not if it is one or both slices combined, I will estimate the weight of one slice (the basic unit on the plate).

The bowl size appears medium; the muesli layer is relatively thick but not overflowing. Typical portion sizes for muesli range from 30 to 60 grams as a dry cereal, falling closer to 40-50 grams in standard portions. Visually, this portion looks like a medium serving, not sparse but not heaped. Therefore, my internal plausible range is 40-60 grams.

It is a medium-sized peach, typical for fresh fruit. The shape is rounded and the skin appears smooth with a slight sheen, indicating ripeness but no damage or shriveling, supporting that it is a fresh peach with skin on. A standard medium peach generally weighs between 120 and 180 grams. Since there is only one peach, and it looks average in size (not particularly small or large), I estimate its weight to be around 150 grams. This falls comfortably within the Swiss typical fruit portion range of 120-180 grams and matches visual expectations for a ripe, medium peach.\",\n  \"pêche\": 150\n}",

The chou romanesco appears as a portion of green vegetable florets on the plate, located at the upper right. The pieces seem cooked and are in moderate quantity, roughly covering a quarter of the plate area. Romanesco is somewhat dense and cooked vegetables tend to weigh more than their volume suggests, so I must adjust upward compared to raw volume. Comparing the size of the florets to the other foods on the plate (penne pasta and gratin), the chou romanesco portion looks substantial but not large. Swiss portion references for cooked vegetables usually range 120-180g for side dishes. Given it is a side and the portion appears medium-sized with some volume but not piled high, I estimate a plausible range of 130-160g. Considering adjustments for cooked vegetable density and the volume shown, the most reasonable estimation is about 145 grams.\",\n  \"chou romanesco\": 145\n}",

Given the thin layer and the typical density of butter, each spread probably weighs between 5 to 8 grams. Considering the visible amount, I estimate the total butter on both slices combined to be about 7 grams. The bread slices seem standard-sized, so this amount of butter fits well with a typical light butter spread on toast.\",\n  \"beurre\": 7\n}",

The bread slices are neither very thick nor very thin, and there are two slices visible, but the estimation focuses on a single slice of bread, as per the target food item. Given size, thickness, and typical density of this type of bread, a reasonable weight estimate for one slice is about 35 grams. The portion size corresponds to a regular single serving of bread.

The bowl is not filled to the top; the cereals are covered partially by milk, suggesting a modest serving size. Given the bowl size relative to the spoon in the background, the volume of cereals appears to be moderate. Dry cereals typically weigh more than they appear due to their density, but with milk added the volume can be deceptive. Estimating the dry cereals alone without milk, the portion looks like approximately 30-40 grams of cereals. Taking a middle ground considering some milk volume and cereal density, an estimated weight of about 35 grams is reasonable and plausible. This fits well with typical breakfast cereal servings which often range between 30 and 50 grams per bowl. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the cereals to be approximately 35 grams.\",\n  \"céréales\": 35\n}",

The image shows a bowl with two main visible components: cooked chard stalks and leaves in a tomato-based sauce (côtes de bettes à la sauce tomate), and an omelette with parsley leaned against the bowl's edge. The target food is the cooked chard with tomato sauce. The volume of the liquid sauce plus the leaves/stalks occupies roughly half of a medium bowl. Swiss portion references for cooked vegetables as side dishes are 120-180g, but this is a dense cooked vegetable dish with visible tomato sauce liquid and substantial cooked leaves and stalks. Considering the watery aspect, the wet tomato sauce will significantly add to the weight, so I apply a 1.5-2x factor to my initial estimate. Visually, the chard portion looks medium-sized, neither sparse nor excessive, filling the bottom half of the bowl with some depth. Given this and factoring in density and sauce, an internal plausible range is 160-220g. I place my estimate near the middle-upper range to avoid underestimation, around 190 grams. This estimation fits well relative to the omelette that appears typical in size and the bowl volume.

Considering the total volume of quinoa compared to the asparagus and a medium piece of salmon, and noting that cooked quinoa is less dense than grains or legumes but more than leafy vegetables, I estimate an internal plausible range around 140-190 grams. Swiss portion size for cooked cereal grains like quinoa is roughly similar to cooked rice, which is 80-200 grams as a side dish, so this fits well. The quinoa pile is moderate to large, almost filling half the bowl volume, so I lean towards the higher middle of the range.

Each slice appears to be about the size of a typical small rustic bread roll halved. The butter is spread fairly evenly but thinly on the two slices. Given that a typical thin spread of butter on one small bread piece weighs about 5-7 grams, and here we have two pieces with butter, I estimate approximately 6-7 grams of butter per slice. Therefore, the total butter weight visible is approximately 12-14 grams.

There are about 7 sizeable cubes visible, roughly 3-4 cm each. Given tofu's density and that this mango-flavored tofu likely includes some dressing or seasoning making it a denser side dish, each piece can be estimated around 25-30g. This leads to an estimated total weight between 175g and 210g for the tofu. The portion is medium-sized compared to other items like quinoa and vegetables which cover similar areas. Swiss portion reference for meat/side proteins is 120-180g, but here the tofu appears more generously portioned.

Each brioche au chocolat looks dense and rich but not very large in diameter, estimated roughly around 8-9 cm across. Considering typical bakery items of this size, a single brioche au chocolat roll often weighs between 60 and 90 grams. The visual density and size suggest it is closer to a medium portion size. Compared to the darker brown pain aux noix roll, the brioche au chocolat looks somewhat lighter and less dense.

Considering the volume and density of strawberries, which contain a lot of water but have some density, the total visible amount likely corresponds to about 120-160 grams. The sugar weight is negligible compared to the strawberries. Swiss portion sizes for fruit generally range from 120-180 grams for a typical portion.

The portion size looks to be roughly a thick slice about 7-8 cm in length and width, with some depth that is typical for gratin dishes. Given its dense content and creamy texture, this gratin is expected to weigh more than just its visual surface area would suggest. Swiss portion sizes for cooked vegetables range from 120-180g for side dishes, but cooked gratins and vegetable dishes tend to be underestimated and should be adjusted upward by around 40-60%. Considering the gratin occupies about a quarter of the plate and appears dense and moist, a reasonable weight estimate would be in the upper half of this range.

Comparing to the other items, such as the pieces of tuna beneath and the cherry tomatoes at the side, the corn volume is substantial, covering much of the plate center. A standard serving of canned corn on a salad can weigh between 70g and 120g depending on the amount. Given the dense pile and how much it covers the plate, this portion seems moderate to large, but not excessive. A plausible range might be 80-110g.
