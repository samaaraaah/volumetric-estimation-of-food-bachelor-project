The image shows a bowl with several food items including chopped tomato, cucumber, shredded carrot, pumpkin seeds, and a white creamy portion which is likely the sérac. The target food item is 'carotte' (carrot). The shredded carrot portion is visible as a heaped pile on one side of the bowl. For dimension analysis, the pile is approximately 7-8 cm long and 4-5 cm wide with a moderate thickness of about 1.5-2 cm. Shredded carrot is dense yet somewhat light compared to cooked vegetables. Estimating volume based on this footprint and thickness gives roughly 50-60 cm³. Given the density of raw carrots is about 0.7 g/cm³, this equates to roughly 35-42 grams. Considering the shredded nature likely includes some air space, the weight should be slightly reduced but overall this matches a small to medium Swiss portion size of shredded carrot. Therefore, I estimate the shredded carrot weight at approximately 38 grams.\",\n  \"carotte\": 38\n}",

They appear to have a coarse texture from millet, black beans, and corn kernels. There are clearly three galettes, roughly uniform in size. Each galette appears thicker than but roughly similar in diameter to a typical small palm-sized veggie patty, about 7-8 cm across and about 1.5-2 cm thick. Given their grain and legume composition, they are moderately dense. Typical homemade millet and bean patties of this size usually weigh between 60-80 grams each. For three patties, the total weight range is approximately 180-240 grams. The portion size in the image appears moderate rather than large. Therefore, estimating towards the middle of this range seems reasonable.

Looking at the image, there is one visible spear of green asparagus lying horizontally near the center-right side of the plate. The asparagus spear is medium-sized, approximately 10-12 cm long judging by comparison to the cherry tomatoes and the size of the rice grains. The thickness appears typical for asparagus stalks, around 1.5-2 cm in diameter. Considering that cooked asparagus tends to weigh about 15-20 grams per 10 cm spear, and estimating the visible spear to be a single full piece, the weight is likely around 15 grams. Given there are no additional asparagus spears visible, and no indication of hidden pieces, I estimate the weight of the asparagus on this plate to be approximately 15 grams.\",\n  \"asperges\": 15\n}",

The target food is 'panais' (parsnip), which is visible as several pale, flesh-colored chunks mixed in with other roasted vegetables on the plate. Step 1: Visually identify and count the pieces — there are roughly 4 to 5 visible pieces of parsnip, irregularly shaped and cut into thick segments averaging about 3-4 cm in length and 1.5-2 cm in width and depth. Step 2: Dimension analysis — compared to the size of the carrot slices and potato chunks on the plate, these parsnip pieces appear compact and dense, with some thickness to them, indicating a non-negligible volume. Given the plate size (standard dinner plate ~26 cm diameter) and the pile depth (~2-3 cm), the cumulative volume of parsnip appears moderate but not overwhelming. Step 3: Density considerations — cooked parsnip is dense and starchy, similar to potato but slightly lighter. Density can be roughly estimated around 0.7-0.8 g/cm3. Step 4: Portion size — in a typical Swiss meal context, the total vegetable portion size on the plate is medium, with the parsnip portion representing about one-quarter to one-third of the mixed vegetables. Step 5: Cross-validation — estimating average piece volume about 10-15 cm3 (thickness x width x length) per piece, times 5 pieces gives 50-75 cm3. Applying density ~0.75 g/cm3 yields roughly 38-56 grams. Considering some visual occlusion and mixing, I assess a conservative estimate of approximately 50 grams for the parsnip portion in this dish.\",\n  \"panais\": 50\n}",

The pasta portion covers the central area of the plate but is not piled very high, indicating a moderate depth of around 2-3 cm. Considering both penne and fusilli take space differently but are cooked and compact, the total volume appears to be roughly 150-180 ml in volume. Cooked pasta is dense and heavy relative to volume, with an approximate density of about 0.9 grams per ml. Multiplying volume by density, this gives an estimated weight range of about 135-160 grams. Given the portion size and typical Swiss smaller servings, I estimate the weight of the cooked pasta to be around 150 grams.\",\n  \"pâtes\": 150\n}",

Comparing the size of the yogurt pot to the apple next to it, the pot seems standard-sized for a single serving. The depth and width suggest a volume consistent with a 125g to 150g portion. Swiss portions tend to be slightly smaller than American ones, so I lean towards the lower-middle of this range. Considering visual evidence and typical packaging, I estimate the weight of the 'yaourt nature' to be approximately 130 grams.\",\n  \"yaourt nature\": 130\n}",

Starting with visual identification, the crème de marrons is spread evenly but relatively thinly on a bread slice approximately 10 cm long. The spread covers almost the entire surface but is not piled up, suggesting a moderate volume. For dimension analysis, the surface area covered is roughly 30-35 cm² with a thickness around 0.3 to 0.4 cm. Chestnut cream has a dense, pasty consistency similar to a thick jam, meaning it has a density close to a thick puree, around 1.1 g/cm³. Multiplying surface area by thickness yields a volume of about 10-14 cm³. Using the density, this corresponds to an estimated weight range of approximately 11-15 grams. Given the portion size is modest and typical for a small piece of bread, I select the middle of that range. So, the estimated weight of the crème de marrons is about 13 grams.\",\n  \"crème de marrons\": 13\n}",

The image shows a metal container holding two pieces of flatbread or galette, with one piece partly rolled or folded and the other piece partially torn open to reveal the filling. The galette appears to be approximately the size of a typical small flatbread, roughly 15-18 cm in length and about 10-12 cm in width. Comparing it to the container size, the thickness of the galette is quite thin, around 2-3 mm, consistent with flatbread or lavash type bread. Considering Swiss portion context, where portions tend to be smaller than US sizes, the total weight would be less than larger wraps or flatbreads. Flatbreads and galettes are moderately dense due to their flour content, but very thin. A full single galette of this size weighs roughly 80 grams on average according to typical food composition references. Since two pieces are present, but one is partial or torn, we estimate around 1.5 galettes total visually. Given that, the total weight would be approximately 120 grams. Since the target food is pain/galette, I estimate the visible portion weight including the two pieces together to be about 120 grams.\",\n  \"pain/galette\": 120\n}",

The sauce is primarily visible on and beneath the pasta, covering much of the right side and some parts underneath. The volume of visible sauce extends roughly over half of the container’s base area, with an estimated depth around 0.5 to 1 cm considering some sauce is beneath the pasta. Tomato sauce is moderately dense, closer to water density but slightly thicker, so approximately 1 g/cm³. Given the container appears medium-sized (approximate base dimensions around 15 cm x 9 cm) and the sauce covers an estimated 60% of this area at an average thickness between 0.5 and 1 cm, the total volume approximates 68 - 135 cm³, equivalent to 68 - 135 grams.

The tartelette aux chocolats is the target food. It appears as half a small tart, about 7-8 cm long and 4 cm wide, with a thick chocolate cream and topping. Considering the thickness (around 2-3 cm) and the dense chocolate filling, the chocolate tart is a dense dessert. The crust base adds to the weight while being moderately dense. A whole small tartlette of this size typically weighs around 90-110 grams. Since this is half the tart, the estimated weight should be about half that, approximately 45-55 grams. Given the Swiss portion tendency to be somewhat smaller and the visible size, I estimate the tartelette aux chocolats half to be about 50 grams.\",\n  \"tartelettes aux chocolats\": 50\n}",

The target food item to estimate is 'tomate' (tomato). Visually, the tomato is sliced into six fairly even slices stacked on each other, occupying about a third of the container's surface area on one side. Considering the container size corresponds roughly to a small meal portion, the tomato slices look about medium-sized in diameter as well. The slices appear fresh and juicy, suggesting typical tomato density slightly less than water (~0.95 g/cm3). Estimating the diameter near 7 cm and average slice thickness around 0.7 cm, gives volume close to 23 cm3. Multiplying by the density, that equals approximately 22 grams. Considering some slight variance in thickness and moisture, a medium portion estimate is around 20-25 grams, so I estimate the total weight of the sliced tomato to be 23 grams.\",\n  \"tomate\": 23\n}",

Each slice in the image appears to be roughly the size of a standard slice of bread—about 10 cm by 10 cm—and about 2 cm thick. The thickness and density of gâche bread suggest a weight between 40 and 60 grams per slice. Since there are two slices visible, I must carefully consider the weight per slice, focusing on just one whole slice as the target food. Based on the size comparison to the glass and keys nearby, each slice weighs around 50 grams. Therefore, for a single slice of gâche, I estimate the weight to be 50 grams.\",\n  \"gâche\": 50\n}",

Its thickness is moderate, about 1-1.5 cm, and it contains visible chocolate chunks. Considering the density of baked cookies, which are fairly dense due to sugar, butter, and flour content, the weight is likely more than a very light cookie but less than a dense cake-like item. Typical chocolate chip cookies of this size generally weigh between 40 to 60 grams. Given the visual thickness and the distribution of chocolate chips, I estimate this cookie to be a medium-sized portion around 50 grams.\",\n  \"cookie\": 50\n}",

The image shows one slice of rhubarb tart (tarte à la rhubarbe) on a white plate, alongside a knife and fork which help gauge its size. The slice appears to be about one eighth of a typical tart, roughly 12 cm long on the outer crust. The tart's filling of rhubarb pieces is distributed evenly and the tart has a visible crust thickness around 0.5 cm. Considering the rhubarb is cooked and embedded in a custard-like filling, the density is moderate, with rhubarb pieces being fibrous but softened by cooking. The crust adds bulk but not excessive weight. A whole tart of this size typically weighs about 700-800 grams; one eighth would be about 87-100 grams.

Each slice appears to have roughly 10-15 grams of jam spread across it when considering the surface area and the standard thin spread thickness. Because there are two slices, the total amount of jam should be about 20-30 grams.

Given the plate size (standard dinner plate ~25 cm diameter), the salad portion is moderate, and the sunflower seeds layer is light but not sparse. Sunflower seeds are dense and small, with about 7 grams per tablespoon (roughly a small handful). Visually, the seeds appear to cover less than a full tablespoon, closer to half to three-quarters of a tablespoon.

The tomato sauce is visible as a thin layer inside the pastry and on top. Step 3: Considering the density of puff pastry (light but layered with butter) and the tomato sauce (which adds some moisture and weight but is light overall), the item is moderately dense. Step 4: For a Swiss portion of a small feuilleté snack, typical weights range between 20 g and 35 g. Because this appears to be a small individual piece with visible slight charring and puffed layers, it is closer to the lower-middle of that range.

The rice grains are fluffy and not overly compacted but piled somewhat thickly, suggesting a depth of about 2-3 cm. Using the plate diameter as a reference (standard plate about 25 cm), the rice occupies roughly a quarter of the plate surface area. Given that cooked white rice has a density close to 130-150 g per cup, and considering Swiss portions smaller than US ones, this serving looks to be about 120 to 140 grams.

Since this is only half of the apple, the total apple is about twice this volume. A medium apple typically weighs between 150 to 180 grams; therefore, the half apple shown should weigh between 75 and 90 grams.

The target food is 'perle de blé'. Visually, the pearl wheat is clustered mainly beneath and around the shrimp, covering approximately half of the bowl's visible base. The pearls appear moist, coated with sauce, causing them to clump together and hide some quantity underneath. A typical medium portion for pearl wheat in a Swiss context is around 100-130 grams cooked per serving. Here, given the bowl size compared to the beans and the shrimp portion, the pearl wheat portion occupies a medium volume, somewhat thick but not overly dense, and occupies about 40-50% of the bowl base. Considering the yellow sauce adds some moisture weight but should not overly add to grain weight, I estimate a medium portion of approximately 110 grams of cooked pearl wheat.

The salad consists primarily of leafy greens, which have a very light density. There are several visible leaves layered in the bowl, with some sunflower seeds scattered atop. Given the small bowl and the loosely packed nature of the leaves, the volume appears moderate but not full. The white sauce coats the leaves lightly but does not add substantial weight. Visual comparison to the plate diameter (approximately 20-22 cm) suggests the bowl is approximately 8-10 cm wide and about 5-7 cm deep. Accounting for air space between the leaves, the actual mass of leaves is relatively low. Typical raw lettuce density is about 0.14-0.16 g/cm3. Estimating the volume of the salad in the bowl around 200-250 cm3, this gives approximately 30-40 grams of green salad by itself. The white sauce looks minimal, perhaps 10-15 grams, but since we only estimate 'salade verte', sauce is excluded.

I focus only on the dalh de lentilles corail for estimation. The dalh occupies roughly half of a medium-sized bowl. The visible depth of the dalh is consistent with a thick stew, so the volume is substantial, not just surface coverage. Considering the bowl size relative to the spoon, which is a standard teaspoon, the filled volume of dalh is about 250-300 ml. Lentils cooked in stew have a dense composition, so weight is quite high per volume. Given typical density for cooked lentil stew around 0.9-1.0 g/ml, this volume suggests roughly 270-300 grams of dalh. Accounting for some air pockets and not completely full depth in parts, I estimate around the middle to lower end of that range.

Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given these segments are medium size and a standard Swiss orange weighs approximately 130-150 g whole, four medium segments might represent roughly half an orange. So, each segment is probably about 25 g. Multiplying 4 segments by 25 g gives about 100 g. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The total of 100 g fits well with the visual portion in relation to the plate and other fruits present, and seems reasonable for a peeled, de-membraned orange portion. Therefore, I estimate the orange segments weigh approximately 100 grams in total.\",\n  \"orange\": 100\n}",

I estimate a weight range of 10-15 grams and select approximately 13 grams considering the thickness and spread.\",\n  \"parmesan\": 13\n}",

The target food is 'pâte à tartiner au chocolat', which is visible as a spread on three slices of 'tresse au beurre' bread. First, I identify the chocolate spread covering almost the entire surface of the three slice pieces with some partial edges showing the bread. The amount of spread appears uniform with visible lines left by the spreading knife. The bread slices are roughly the size of common sliced bread, approximately 12 cm by 6-7 cm and about 2 cm thick. Considering a moderate layer of chocolate spread at about 2 to 3 millimeters thickness and remembering that chocolate spread (nutella-type) is dense and sticky, density close to about 1.3 g/cm³, the volume of spread can be approximated as surface area times thickness. Each slice surface approx 72-84 cm² (12 x 6-7), three slices total roughly 220-250 cm². Multiply by thickness 0.2-0.3 cm gives volume 44-75 cm³ approx. Multiplying by density 1.3 g/cm³ yields between 57 to 98 grams of chocolate spread. Given the spread is moderate but not very thick or thin, a medium estimate about 75 grams total of 'pâte à tartiner au chocolat' seems reasonable. Depth and density considered, this measure reflects typical serving sizes in Swiss context, excluding any container. Hence, I estimate the weight of the 'pâte à tartiner au chocolat' spread in the image at approximately 75 grams.\",\n  \"pâte à tartiner au chocolat\": 75\n}",

The image shows a stack of four rectangular crackers labeled as 'blévita graines de courges.' Each cracker is thin and roughly consistent in size and thickness. By comparing to the wood grain of the table, typical dimensions of such a cracker are about 7-8 cm length and 5 cm width, with each cracker being quite thin—likely around 3-4 mm in thickness. These crackers are dense, containing grains and pumpkin seeds, which adds to their weight despite their thinness. From known nutritional data, a single Blévita cracker of this type usually weighs about 10 grams each. Since there are four crackers stacked, the cumulative weight should be around 40 grams. Considering the density and visible thickness closely, I estimate the total weight of these four blévita graines de courges crackers to be approximately 40 grams.\",\n  \"blévita graines de courges\": 40\n}",

In the image, the mustard itself is not directly visible outside the pita bread, but logically it would be a thin spread inside the sandwich. Mustard is a condiment applied sparingly, usually in a thin layer with a very low volume and weight relative to the other ingredients. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes and usual spreading thickness, the mustard content is likely around 5 to 10 grams. Given the visual evidence of a single pita sandwich and typical mustard application, I estimate the mustard weight to be approximately 7 grams.\",\n  \"moutarde\": 7\n}"
