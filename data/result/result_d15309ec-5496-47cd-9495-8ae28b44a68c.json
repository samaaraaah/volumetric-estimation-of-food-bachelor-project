The salad portion covers roughly a 7 cm by 5 cm area with a height estimated around 2 cm since it is loosely piled. This results in an approximate volume of 7 cm * 5 cm * 2 cm = 70 ml. The salad is pasta and some vegetables, with a typical density for mixed pasta salad around 0.8 g/ml (slightly less dense than pure pasta due to vegetables). Thus, estimated weight is 70 ml * 0.8 g/ml = 56 g. Conservative low-high range would be 50-65 g to allow for slight depth or compaction variations.

The specified food, tarte aux fraises, is identified as the slice of strawberry tart on a standard dessert plate (≈20 cm diameter). Comparing the tart slice size relative to the plate, it occupies about one-sixth to one-eighth of the plate's area. The tart slice is approximately 10 cm long and 5 cm wide, with a visible depth of about 2.5 cm. This yields an estimated volume around 125 cubic centimeters (10 x 5 x 2.5). The tart consists of a dense crust, cream filling, and strawberries. Estimating an average density for the tart at around 0.9 g/ml due to crust and creamy elements balancing with fruit lightness is reasonable. 125 ml volume x 0.9 g/ml density gives about 113 grams. A plausible low-high range with slight variance in density and volume is 100 to 130 grams.

Typically, a drizzle of oil on such a dish might be approximately 1 tablespoon (about 15 ml = 15 g). The oil would not appear as a visible volume but must be accounted for realistically. Density for linseed oil is close to 0.92 g/ml, but for estimation 1 g/ml is acceptable. Low estimate could be as little as 5 g (a thin drizzle), high estimate around 15-20 g (one tablespoon). Given the food presentation and no visible excess, a reasonable estimate is about 10 g of linseed oil used in this dish.

Calculating the volume as a triangular prism: area of the base (approx. 0.5 x 12 cm x 7 cm = 42 cm²) times height (2.5 cm) gives a volume of roughly 105 ml, which we approximate as 105 g, given the density of a fruit tart with pastry and custard filling is close to 1 g/ml. Considering some variability in pastry density and filling moisture, a reasonable low-high range would be 90-120 g. This fits well with physical size and typical tart slice weights.

Bell peppers have a density roughly between 0.3 and 0.5 g/ml because they are crunchy vegetables with some water content. Using 0.4 g/ml as a moderate density gives an estimated weight of 40 ml x 0.4 g/ml = 16 grams. A plausible low-high range would be 12 g (if slices are thin and sparse) to 20 g (if denser slices).

Assuming a density similar to firm cheese, approximately 1.1 g/ml, the volume per cube is about 2 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm = 8 ml. For 4 cubes, the total volume is approximately 32 ml.

Courgette and onion cooked, mostly vegetable with some water content, have a typical density around 0.3 to 0.5 g/ml depending on cooking and water retained; using 0.4 g/ml is a balanced estimate.

Assuming a spread thickness of about 0.4 cm, the volume of the crème de marrons is 28 cm² × 0.4 cm = 11.2 ml approximately. Crème de marrons has a density close to a thick preserve, roughly 1.2 g/ml, so multiplying 11.2 ml × 1.2 g/ml gives about 13.4 grams.

Using 0.35 g/ml, the mass of one slice of toast is approximately 146 x 0.35 = 51 grams. There are two slices visible, but the task is for a single specified item (toast), so we estimate the combined weight or per slice as needed. Since the food name is 'toast' in singular but visually two slices exist, we consider the total toast portion. Two slices therefore weigh about 102 grams total. However, if the specification was for one slice, it would be about 50 grams. The plausible range per slice is 45-55 grams; total range for both slices is 90 to 110 grams. Since the user asked for toast in general and there are two slices, the best estimate is the combined weight of the toast seen.

Given the size relative to the bowl and the typical density of cooked patties (dense solids ≥ 1 g/ml), and considering the ingredients (millet, black beans, corn) which are dense but contain some air, I estimate density around 1 g/ml.

The slice of bread covers roughly half the diameter of the plate and has an average thickness for a typical slice of whole grain bread, around 2-3 cm thick. Bread typically has a density of about 0.3-0.4 g/ml (light and airy structure). The slice measures approximately 12 cm by 10 cm by 2 cm, giving a volume estimate of 240 ml. Multiplying by bread density (0.35 g/ml) results in a weight estimate of about 84 g. A low-high weight range for a slice of this size is roughly 70-100 g. My estimate of 85 g fits well into this range, representing realistic thickness and size of the slice shown.

The tomato portion fills about one third of the container's base area and roughly 1 cm thick. Given this, the volume is approximately 18 cm x 4 cm (one third width) x 1 cm height = 72 ml. The density of raw tomato is around 0.3–0.4 g/ml due to high water content and internal air spaces. Using 0.35 g/ml as a midpoint, mass is about 72 ml x 0.35 g/ml = 25 g.

The visible level of food is around 3-4 cm deep in the bowl. Estimating the volume as a cylinder: about 13 cm diameter and 3.5 cm height gives volume ≈ π * (6.5 cm)^2 * 3.5 cm ≈ 463 ml. Given the creamy density of 'séré maigre' mixed with nut purée and chia seeds, the density would be around 1.0 g/ml. This gives a weight estimate near 460-470 g. However, the bowl is not fully filled, and some empty space is visible, so a slightly conservative estimate is about 400-450 g. The plausible low-high range is 380-480 g considering some uncertainty.

The reference object used here is the wooden surface with visible grain and measurements inferred by standard wood plank widths (~7-10 cm wide), and the chocolate bar length is about 10 cm, confirming it is a single standard bar piece. The volume of the bar can be roughly estimated as a cuboid: about 10 cm long, 2 cm wide, and 1.5 cm thick. This gives a volume around 30 cubic cm. Chocolate density is approximately 1.3 g/ml, so 30 cm³ × 1.3 g/cm³ = 39 grams approximately. Low-high weight range would be around 35-45 grams, which fits well-known commercial Kinder bar weights.

The density of raw vegetables such as lettuce is roughly 0.2 - 0.5 g/ml; considering the lettuce leaves are somewhat packed and dressed, a median density of 0.4 g/ml is appropriate. Multiplying volume and density gives 140 ml x 0.4 g/ml = 56 grams as the estimated weight. A low-high plausible range would be around 40-70 grams.

To estimate volume, multiply these dimensions: 10 cm x 6 cm x 2 cm = 120 cm³. Chicken breast density is approximately 1 g/cm³ since it is dense lean meat. Therefore, the weight estimate is about 120 grams. Considering some margin for the shape and possible thinner areas, a reasonable low-high range would be 110-130 grams.

Average cherry tomato weight is about 15-20 grams. Given their size and number, total volume estimate is roughly 20 tomatoes × ~16 g average weight = approx. 320 g total. Density for cherry tomatoes is close to water, about 1 g/ml. The low-high plausible range is 280-360 g based on size variations and some tomatoes partially obscured.

Volume estimation using the approximate dimensions (length ~13 cm, width ~2.5 cm, and height ~1 cm) yields approximately 32.5 ml; given chocolate density close to 1.1 g/ml, the calculated volume-based weight would be around 35-40 grams.

The stack of four would thus be approximately 1.2 cm thick. The volume of one cracker = length x width x height = 8 cm x 5 cm x 0.3 cm = 12 cm³, so four crackers total about 48 cm³. Crackers are dry, crunchy items with a density around 0.8 g/ml, slightly less than water due to air pockets. Therefore, estimated mass = volume x density = 48 cm³ x 0.8 g/cm³ = 38.4 g.

The mélasse spread is fairly thin, covering most of the surface of the slice but not very thick, perhaps around 2 mm thick. Considering the area of about 100 cm² and a thin layer 0.2 cm thick, volume is approximately 20 cm³ or ml. Molasses density is close to a thick syrup, roughly 1.4 g/ml.

Using approximate dimensions of 25 cm diameter and 1.5 cm thickness, the pizza is roughly a flat cylinder with volume π*(12.5^2)*1.5 = about 735 ml in volume. The density of pizza (bread base plus cheese, vegetables) is about 0.9 to 1.0 g/ml, close to dense solid but slightly less than water due to air in the crust. So estimated weight range is roughly 660 to 735 g for the whole pizza. However, the image shows 4 slices remaining out of what likely was 6 or 8 slices originally. Estimating the current visible portion (4 slices) as about half the pizza (if total 8 slices), then weight is about 330 to 370 g. Alternatively, if total 6 slices and 4 remain, that is 2/3 pizza, so weight is about 440 to 490 g.

Since fresh spinach leaves have a very low density, roughly 0.2–0.3 g/ml (grams per cubic centimeter), using 0.25 g/ml as average density.
