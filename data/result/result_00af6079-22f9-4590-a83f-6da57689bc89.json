Each piece is a standard segment of a chocolate bar, and based on known weights of similar chocolate segments, each piece typically weighs around 5-6 grams. Since there are two pieces visible, the total weight would be approximately 10-12 grams. Considering the density and size of the chocolate, I estimate the total weight to be 11 grams.\",\n  \"chocolat noir crémant\": 11\n}",

The image shows three slices of tresse au beurre (butter braid bread) spread with chocolate pâte à tartiner (chocolate spread). The spread is evenly applied on each slice, covering most of the surface. Based on the thickness of the spread, it appears to be a moderate layer, not overly thick. A typical serving of chocolate spread for one slice of bread is approximately 15-20 grams. Since there are three slices, and the spread is consistent across all of them, the total weight of the chocolate spread is approximately 45-60 grams. To account for slight variations in application, I estimate the weight of the pâte à tartiner au chocolat to be 55 grams.\",\n  \"pâte à tartiner au chocolat\": 55\n}",

There are 5 crackers visible in the stack. Based on standard information, a single Blévita cracker typically weighs around 10 grams. Since there are 5 crackers in the stack, the total weight can be estimated as 5 × 10 grams = 50 grams.

The pita bread is of standard size, appearing to be about 12-15 cm in diameter and moderately thick. Based on typical weights for a standard pita bread of this size, it would weigh approximately 60-70 grams.
