The grilled chicken is visible in the cut section of the wrap, mixed with the ratatouille. Based on the size of the wrap and the visible portion of the chicken, it appears that the chicken is a minor component of the filling, with the ratatouille taking up more volume. Assuming the wrap contains approximately 30-40% chicken by weight, and estimating the total weight of the wrap to be around 250 grams, the weight of the grilled chicken would be approximately 75-100 grams.

The slices appear to be standard-sized sandwich bread, toasted. A typical slice of bread weighs around 25-30 grams before toasting. Toasting removes some moisture but does not significantly reduce the weight. Since there are two slices, the total weight of the toast would be approximately 50-60 grams. Based on the visual appearance and standard bread weights, I estimate the weight of the toast to be 55 grams.\",\n\t\"toast\": 55\n}",
    "99": "{\n\t\"reasoning\": \"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The tomme de savoie is located on the plate as the cheese piece with a beige rind and a creamy white interior, positioned near the center of the plate. It is a single piece, cut into a wedge shape. Based on its size relative to the other cheeses and the baguette slice, it appears to be a small portion. Tomme de savoie is a semi-soft cheese, so it is denser than soft cheeses like brie but less dense than hard cheeses. Considering its dimensions and density, I estimate its weight to be approximately 25 grams.\",\n\t\"tomme de savoie\": 25\n}"
