The image shows a portion of crème caramel served in a small blue bowl, held close to the person's leg for scale. The dessert appears creamy and smooth with a typical pudding-like consistency. The volume is relatively small, roughly equivalent to a few spoonfuls, occupying the base of the bowl with a shallow depth. Considering the typical density of a crème caramel (similar to a thick custard), such a visible portion corresponds to about 100 to 130 grams. The bowl size and the person's fingers give a good perceptual reference. Given the portion appears to be moderate but not full to the brim and slightly unevenly spread, a safe estimate is around 120 grams. This fits well within the plausible range, not too small or overly large for a dessert portion of this type.\",\n  \"crème caramel\": 120\n}",

The image shows a slice of 'délice des dieux,' which is a dessert consisting of a biscuit base soaked with juice from red fruits, topped with a creamy layer of séré and mascarpone, and garnished with fresh red fruits (raspberries and blueberries). The piece appears to be approximately the size of a standard dessert portion, about 8 cm by 7 cm and about 2-3 cm thick. The biscuit base looks moist and dense, likely contributing significantly to the weight, while the mascarpone and séré cream layer adds volume but less density. The fresh fruits, including three raspberries and two blueberries, add a modest but notable contribution. Based on the plate size and texture cues, the portion seems medium-sized, not too large or small. The minimum to maximum plausible weight range is around 80 to 110 grams considering density and volume. A balanced final estimate accounting for biscuit density and creamy layers is approximately 95 grams.\",\n  \"délice des dieux (biscuit, fruits rouges, séré+mascarpone)\": 95\n}",

The image shows four pieces of sweet potato waffles ('gaufre à la patate douce') on a plate, each topped with a layer of cream sauce and slices of smoked salmon. Each waffle piece is roughly 7-8 cm wide and about 1.5 cm thick. Considering that a typical whole sweet potato waffle before cutting weighs approximately 100-130 grams, and here we have four quarters (so a whole waffle portion), the total weight of the waffles alone would be around 100-130 grams. Adjusting for moisture loss during cooking and the waffle's slightly dense but airy texture, I estimate the weight of the sweet potato waffle portion visible in the image to be around 120 grams in total. Since the quantity on the plate corresponds to one whole waffle cut into four pieces, the weight estimate aligns well with typical sweet potato waffle sizes in Switzerland. Therefore, the estimated weight for the 'gaufre à la patate douce' is approximately 120 grams.\",\n  \"gaufre à la patate douce\": 120\n}",

Considering that cherry tomatoes weigh around 15g each and these chunks are part of larger slicing tomatoes, each piece might weigh approximately 15-20 grams due to their size and density. Multiplying by 8 pieces gives a range of about 120 to 160 grams.

The chili portion occupies about half of the plate. The meat chunks (cervelas) are cut into medium-sized cubes, mixed with kidney beans and thick tomato-based sauce. Given the plate diameter is a common size (around 25-27 cm), the chili portion looks like a standard single serving. Chili is dense due to the meat, beans, and sauce. A typical cooked chili serving size visually comparable to this weighs between 250-300 grams. The portion is substantial, covering half the plate with some thickness and moisture visible. Therefore, estimating the chili weight around 280 grams fits well. This accounts for the volume and density, as well as the piece sizes of cervelas.\",\n  \"chili\": 280\n}",

The volume of the courgette and onions portion fills about half of the container. The zucchini pieces are medium-sized slices, and the onions are thinly sliced, cooked down but still clearly visible. The container itself looks like a typical glass storage container about 15cm x 15cm square and about 4-5 cm deep. Based on this, the courgette and onion mixture appears to be a moderate portion, not overly packed but reasonably dense. Considering the water content and softness of cooked courgettes and onions, the weight is less than it would appear from volume alone due to some air trapped but still fairly dense when cooked and mixed. A similar portion of cooked vegetables of this visible size generally weighs about 120-160 grams. Given the portion size is medium and the container is about half full, I estimate the weight of the courgette and onion mixture to be about 140 grams as a reasonable midpoint. This accounts for depth and density without overestimation.\",\n  \"courgette et oignons\": 140\n}",

The mashed potatoes cover a substantial portion of the plate area beneath the meat and carrots. Given the common density of mashed potatoes and the visible volume, I estimate the portion to be medium-sized but not overly large. The plate size and other components give scale, confirming this is a typical homemade serving in Switzerland.

Counting the visible blueberries, there are about 9 to 10 blueberries, some of which are medium-sized while others are slightly smaller. Each blueberry typically weighs between 1 to 2 grams, with 1.5 grams as a reasonable average for fresh blueberries in Switzerland. Considering the total volume and density of the visible blueberries, a plausible weight range would be 12 to 18 grams. Given the pile and visible quantity, I estimate the total weight of the myrtilles to be approximately 15 grams. This estimate aligns well with the relative portion sizes of other items in the bowl such as the raspberries and the porridge.\",\n  \"myrtilles\": 15\n}",

The tiramisu slice is roughly rectangular, with a creamy layer on top that has cocoa powder sprinkled on it and visible soaked sponge layers underneath. Judging by the size relative to the plate and the forêt noir slice, the tiramisu portion looks like a medium dessert slice, approximately 7-8 cm in length, 3-4 cm wide, and about 3-4 cm thick. Tiramisu is relatively light due to its creamy mascarpone and soft sponge, but moisture adds some weight. This slice seems like it originally came from a standard-sized cake portion. The likely weight range for such a slice is between 90 grams (small-medium) and 130 grams (medium-large). Given the creaminess and thickness of the slice observed, a final estimate around 110 grams is plausible and consistent with the overall scale and size.\",\n  \"tiramisu\": 110\n}",

The banana piece appears to be about half the length of an average full banana and is of standard thickness for a banana. A typical medium banana in Switzerland weighs approximately 120-130 grams with skin; peeling it reduces weight by about 12-15%. Given this is about half a banana without the peel, I estimate the weight to be roughly half of 110 grams (average peeled banana weight), so about 55 grams.

On top, there is a noticeable mound of grated gruyère cheese. Evaluating the pasta portion, it looks like a medium serving, spread across the plate but not piled very high, consistent with a moderate single meal portion. The quantity of pasta likely corresponds to about 140-170 grams of cooked pasta, considering its density and volume on the plate. The grated gruyère appears to be a generous sprinkling, roughly equivalent to a small handful, estimating between 25-35 grams. Given the limited thickness of the cheese layer, it does not seem excessive. Summing these, the pâtes carbonara (pasta, sauce, and bacon) portion without the cheese on top probably weighs around 150 grams. The cheese is a separate item, so for the food item 'pâtes carbonara', I estimate 150 grams. This estimate is plausible and consistent with typical Swiss meal portion sizes for this dish.\",\n  \"pâtes carbonara\": 150\n}",

The wrap appears to be approximately 20-22 cm in diameter, a common size for galette wraps in Switzerland. It is thin but covers a large surface area. Considering the typical density and thickness of galette wraps made from buckwheat or wheat flour, these usually weigh between 60 and 70 grams for a whole wrap of this size. There are no visible signs of additional thickness or extra layering, so a standard weight near this range is appropriate.\",\n  \"galette wraps\": 65\n}",

The slice is on a standard-sized dessert plate, providing scale. The strawberry pieces are medium-sized and cover the top of the tart slice generously, indicating a substantial fruit portion. The crust looks thin but dense, with some breaking off on the plate. Considering the typical density of a strawberry tart slice with cream, the combined weight is moderate. The portion appears medium-sized but not overly thick or large, likely between 120 and 160 grams. Given the visible fruit amount, crust, and cream, I estimate the weight to be approximately 140 grams.\",\n  \"tarte aux fraises\": 140\n}",

The image shows a small slice of bread (tartine) with a spread of chestnut cream (crème de marrons) and some visible butter underneath or mixed. The slice appears to be a piece of baguette or similar bread, roughly 10 cm long and around 4-5 cm wide. A typical slice of this size weighs about 15-20 grams. The butter and chestnut cream are spread lightly but covering most of the surface, with the chestnut cream likely adding moisture and density, while butter adds some fat weight. Generally, a thin spread of butter might be around 5 grams and the chestnut cream layer about 8-10 grams for such a small portion. Considering the visible thickness and coverage, a plausible range for the tartine with coatings would be around 28-35 grams in total. Since the target food is 'tartine avec crème de marrons et beurre' (the whole item), the best estimate combining bread and spreads is about 32 grams, fitting the visual evidence and reasonable portion size for Switzerland.

The 'bout de gruyère' is centrally placed and appears as a single rectangular slice approximately 12-13 cm long, about 2 cm wide, and roughly 1.5 cm thick. Gruyère is a dense cheese, and based on typical density and typical slice thickness, this portion is medium-sized. A similar-sized slice of gruyère usually weighs between 50 and 70 grams. Given the visible size and thickness, I estimate this piece weighs about 60 grams.

The sauce covers a small portion of the plate around the meat and has some pooling under the other food items, indicating a wet consistency. Given the visible quantity—enough to coat the meat slice and a bit spread on the plate—this portion looks like a light to medium serving of sauce, typically denser than water but not heavy in volume. Considering common Swiss servings of sauce and the plate size reference, I estimate the sauce weight to be between 30 and 50 grams.

Greek salad ingredients are moderately dense, with cheese and olives adding some weight. Considering the container's size (roughly 15 cm length, 10 cm width, 8 cm height) and its fill level, a typical portion like this could weigh between 200 to 250 grams.

Considering the visible size, the thickness, and the bite taken at the bottom, the croissant looks closer to a medium-sized portion. The surface texture and density also indicate a typical buttery, flaky pastry with chocolate filling inside. I estimate a plausible weight range of 70 to 85 grams, choosing a mid-value due to the visible intact portion and typical bakery size.

Given the thickness and density typical for this kind of bread, an average slice weighs about 40-50 grams. Since this slice appears to be medium thickness and is intact without large holes, it is reasonable to estimate toward the middle of the range. Also, visible butter and spread do not add much weight to the bread itself, so butter cannot be counted here. Therefore, for one slice of this 'pain', I estimate roughly 45 grams.
