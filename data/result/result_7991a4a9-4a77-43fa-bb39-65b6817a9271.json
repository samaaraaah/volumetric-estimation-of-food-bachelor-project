The image shows a plastic container filled with slices of raw kohlrabi ('colrave crue'). The slices are relatively thin and triangular in shape, and they are stacked loosely in the container. Based on the size of the container and the visible volume of the kohlrabi slices, I estimate the total weight of the kohlrabi. Kohlrabi is a dense vegetable, so the weight will be higher than it might appear. Considering the container's size and the density of the slices, I estimate the weight of the kohlrabi to be approximately 250 grams.\",\n\t\"colrave crue\": 250\n}",

The fresh spinach (épinards frais) is visible as the base layer of the salad, covering the bottom of the bowl. The leaves are whole and not chopped, and they appear to be loosely packed. Based on the size of the bowl and the visible volume of spinach, I estimate that there are approximately 50-70 grams of fresh spinach. Fresh spinach is lightweight and voluminous, so even though it appears to fill a significant portion of the bowl, the actual weight is relatively low. Considering the density and the visible amount, I estimate the weight to be 60 grams.\",\n\t\"épinards frais\": 60\n}"
