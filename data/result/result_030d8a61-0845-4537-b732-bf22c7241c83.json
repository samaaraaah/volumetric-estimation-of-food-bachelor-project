The shredded carrots seem loosely piled, occupying a volume roughly equivalent to about 70 grams, considering their light, shredded form and the visual fullness. The chopped tomatoes are small and more abundant, likely around 60 grams in total, based on the size of the pieces and their spread. The pumpkin seeds are scattered on top and appear to be about 10 grams in weight, considering their small size and quantity. Sérac is a dense cheese and appears to be a small, dense mound—estimating about 30 grams, as it looks quite compact compared to other ingredients. The vinaigre is a thin liquid, so its weight contribution is minimal, around 5 grams for the small amount visible.\",\n  \"carotte\": 70\n}",

The image shows a bowl containing a mixed salad, a portion of beetroot purée, and two galettes of millet, black beans, and corn. The portion of galettes appears to be about 2 to 3 pieces, and considering generous servings of small, dense cakes, each galette is likely around 50 grams based on their size relative to the bowl. Given that the galettes are compact and dense ingredients like millet, beans, and corn typically weigh more than they look, I estimate each at approximately 50 grams. Two galettes total about 100 grams. The salad portion looks to be a handful of mixed greens, likely around 30 grams, and the beetroot purée appears to be roughly 50 grams based on volume and typical serving sizes. Summing these estimates, I arrive at a total of about 180 grams.

The pile appears to be a mixed medley with varying sizes and shapes of chopped vegetables. The quantity visible suggests a modest serving, typical for a portion per person. The potatoes and carrots are the most prominent, with the potatoes cut into roughly 2-3 cm chunks, which helps estimate volume. The parsnips are similar in size to potatoes, and the eggplants are somewhat smaller, with fewer pieces. The amount of visible pieces and their size roughly align with a total weight around 150 grams. Since this is a mixed, roasted dish with vegetables that are relatively dense, I estimate the total weight at approximately 150 grams, focusing on the panais specifically as part of the mixture.\",\n  \"panais\": 150\n}",

The crème de marrons spread on top looks quite thick and plentiful, covering nearly the entire surface area of the bread. Given the size of the bread and the amount of cream, I estimate the total weight of this portion to be roughly in the range of 50-70 grams. Since the bread itself accounts for about 25-30 grams, and the crème de marrons appears to constitute a substantial layer, I would estimate the crème de marrons alone to weigh about 25-35 grams.

Based on visual comparison with the other objects in the image, such as the glass of orange juice and keys, the slices seem to be about 8-10 cm square with a thickness of around 2-3 cm. Considering the density and typical weight of such bread slices, a standard slice of brioche or similar bread usually weighs between 50-70 grams. Since these slices are moderately thick and appear to be of good size, I estimate each slice weighs about 60 grams. The chocolate spread layer looks thin but covers the entire surface evenly, which might add approximately 5 grams per slice. Therefore, each slice with the spread is approximately 65 grams.

Given the size and assuming they are typical artisanal bread slices, each slice likely weighs around 40-50 grams, with the total bread weight for both slices being roughly 80-100 grams. The butter appears to be a thin spread, so its weight contribution is minimal, around 5 grams total. The coing jam looks to be a generous layer covering the surface, approximately 10-15 grams per slice, totaling around 20-30 grams. Since the request is for the weight of the confiture de coing alone, I consider the jam's visible amount to be about 20-30 grams, which seems reasonable for the size shown on the bread slices.\",\n  \"confiture de coing\": 25\n}",

The zucchini slices look evenly baked and are somewhat layered, occupying a quarter of the bowl, with the pasta occupying the remaining three-quarters. The sauce with mushrooms appears to be a light coating rather than a thick layer. For Swiss portion sizes, this looks like a moderate but not overly large serving. Given the density of the pasta and the volume of zucchini, I estimate the pasta portion is around 100-120 grams dry weight, which would cook up to roughly 200 grams. The zucchini and sauce likely add an additional 50-70 grams.

The grilled corn piece is about 10 cm long, representing a small portion, roughly 60-70 grams according to standard portion sizes, but considering the visible size, I estimate around 50 grams. Potato chips are a loose layer, and based on their spread and visible volume, they likely weigh around 30-40 grams. The red pepper appears to be about the size of half a pepper, which in Swiss portions weighs approximately 50 grams in total, so I estimate around 25 grams for the visible piece.
