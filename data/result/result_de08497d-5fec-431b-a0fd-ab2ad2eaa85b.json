The portion is spread thinly along the bottom of the bowl and does not fill it significantly in terms of volume. The texture appears creamy and smooth, typical of a custard-like dessert. Considering the bowl's size relative to the person's hand and thigh, the portion is relatively small — roughly occupying just the base area of a small dessert bowl. Crème caramel is moderately dense due to its custard composition. Given the visual volume, I estimate this serving to be less than a typical full single-serving custard cup (which is often around 120-150g). This portion appears lighter, closer to half a standard serving size, which makes sense for a small or light dessert amount. Therefore, a reasonable weight estimate would be about 70-90 grams, with a final value near the middle of this range for the visible quantity.\",\n  \"crème caramel\": 80\n}",

The cream layer looks dense but light, while the biscuit is soaked with fruit juices, adding moisture and weight. The visible blueberries and raspberries on top serve as size references, indicating the slice is about 10 cm wide and 7-8 cm tall. Given the density of the mascarpone mix, the moist fruit, and the biscuit base, a weight estimate of around 140-170 grams seems plausible. This falls in line with typical dessert portion sizes in Switzerland for such layered fruit-cream cakes.

Considering the plate size as standard and the density of the chili with sausage chunks and beans, the volume looks moderate. Given that sausage and beans are reasonably dense, the chili portion appears to be a medium serving. Typical Swiss meat portions are 120-180g, but this includes beans and sauce, so the total weight can be adjusted upwards. The chili portion likely weighs between 180 to 230 grams.

Considering the plate size and the volume of the purée, it seems to correspond to a typical side serving rather than a large main portion. Swiss standard portions for cooked potatoes or mashed potatoes generally range around 150-200g. This portion does not appear overly heaped or voluminous, being somewhat compressed under the ragout and sauce.

It has visible layers of soaked sponge cake and creamy mascarpone, which adds some density but is lighter than dense cake. Given the volume and typical density of tiramisu, this portion seems to be a single serving. Standard single tiramisu servings weigh roughly between 110-150 grams. Considering this portion is well-formed and fills a substantial part of the plate without being oversized or small, I estimate it to weigh approximately 130 grams.

The gruyère is sprinkled on top in a mound, but not covering the entire portion uniformly. Given the pasta's size and distribution, the pasta weight likely falls near the lower to middle range of a typical Swiss pasta portion (100-170g). The gruyère portion appears modest, likely between 15-25 grams, given its volume and texture. Considering these factors, the estimated weight of the gruyère alone (the target food) appears to be about 20 grams.\",\n  \"gruyère\": 20\n}",

The strawberries are large and numerous, roughly 7 to 8 halves or large pieces. Assuming an average strawberry half weighs about 15-20 grams, the strawberries alone weigh approximately 120-160 grams. The creamy filling layer appears substantial, about a 1 to 1.5 cm thickness, spread evenly across the tart base, which seems thin but covers the entire slice area. The tart base itself is thin and light, typical of pastry, likely around 15-25 grams for this size. Combining these components, the overall weight of the tart slice should be between 160 and 200 grams, with a medium-large portion indicated by the generous strawberry topping and creamy layer.

The diced pieces look small and fairly compact, but the volume does not completely fill the container. Given the density of the vegetables, cheese, olives, and dressing combined, and considering the visible portion in the container, the total weight appears moderate. Swiss portion reference for cooked vegetables ranges around 120-250g, but this salad is a mix of vegetables rather than cooked and is less dense. Also, the portion fills about half the container, which likely holds between 200-300g when full. Hence the salad visible is approximately 120-150g.

Comparing it to the adjacent grilled aubergine slices and the polenta portion topped with shredded cheese helps gauge scale. Swiss standard meat portions range between 120-180 grams. Given the pork's visible thickness, coverage, and size relative to the other foods, it likely falls near the middle of the expected portion size. There are no visible bones or excessive fat that would reduce the meat weight. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the pork portion to be around 140 grams.\",\n  \"porc\": 140\n}",

The ratatouille pile is compact but not very thick, covering an area approximately 7x6 cm and about 2-3 cm thick, appearing moist and dense but vegetable-heavy and less dense than grains or meats. Given the typical density of cooked vegetables and the volume visible, the portion should weigh noticeably less than a typical grain serving. Considering Swiss portion ranges for cooked vegetables (120-250g) but seeing this is a side portion and somewhat limited in volume, I estimate a weight minimum-maximum range of 80-120 grams. Choosing the midpoint, the ratatouille here appears closer to 95 grams due to the volume and moisture visible.

The volume is moderate, the base is thin but the toppings add some weight. Considering the visible size relative to the plate and the thickness of ingredients, it is reasonable to estimate this slice weighs less than a typical dense piece of cake but more than just a thin flatbread. A whole tarte flambée generally weighs around 400-600 grams, and this slice looks to be about a quarter of a whole tarte, so roughly 100-150 grams is plausible.

Considering the spread's visible area and typical thickness of a sauce layer in such a sandwich, the amount is modest. Each sandwich likely contains about 15-20 grams of sauce to give flavor without overwhelming the sandwich. Since the task is to estimate the weight of the sauce curry with mayonnaise, and given the two sandwiches have roughly the same visible amount, I will estimate the combined visible amount first. Each sandwich can be estimated to hold about 18 grams of this sauce, leading to a total of approximately 36 grams of sauce curry with mayonnaise across both sandwiches. However, since the input specifies only the sauce, I will estimate the total visible amount on the plate, which is about 35 grams in total for both sandwiches combined, or about 17.5 grams per sandwich. Therefore, the weight of sauce curry with mayonnaise as visible in the image is approximately 35 grams in total if considered as one portion (for example) or if only one sandwich is meant, then about 17-18 grams, but since context is not fully explicit for one sandwich, I will provide the total for visible sauce in the image, which is about 35 grams.\",\n  \"sauce curry avec mayonnaise\": 35\n}",
