Considering the density and the visible portion, I estimate the weight to be approximately 225 grams.\",\n  \"colrave crue\": 225\n}",
    "99": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.

Based on the volume of spinach visible and typical weights for fresh spinach leaves, a loose handful of spinach weighs approximately 30-40 grams. The amount in the bowl appears to be about 2-3 handfuls, which would correspond to a weight of approximately 90-120 grams. Considering the visible portion and the fact that the spinach is not tightly packed, I estimate the weight of the fresh spinach to be 100 grams.\",\n  \"épinards frais\": 100\n}"
