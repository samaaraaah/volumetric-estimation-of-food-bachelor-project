The target food salade de pâtes is clearly visible as the portion of short spiral pasta with vegetables on the lower left part of the plate. Reference objects include the dinner plate (approx. 26-28 cm diameter) on which the pasta occupies about one-sixth of the plate area. The pasta mound measures roughly 8 cm by 5 cm in surface area with an estimated thickness of about 1.5 cm based on visible volume and typical pasta salad density. Geometric volume = 8 cm × 5 cm × 1.5 cm = 60 cm³. Given it is cooked pasta salad with vegetables, a packing factor of 0.6 is appropriate since there are air gaps and vegetable pieces. Since the bottom is partially visible but pasta salads tend to be mixed, I apply a hidden-layer multiplier of 1.3 to account for some hidden volume underneath the visible top layer. Effective volume = 60 × 0.6 × 1.3 = 46.8 cm³. Density for cooked vegetables and pasta is 0.6-0.8 g/ml; using midpoint density 0.7 g/ml. Weight estimate low-high range = 46.8 × 0.6 = 28 g to 46.8 × 0.8 = 37 g; midpoint ~33 g. Implied average density = midpoint weight / geometric volume = 33 / 60 = 0.55 g/cm³, which is consistent with expected density for pasta salad with some air and veg. For plausibility, typical single serving cooked pasta portions are between 150-250 g, but this plate portion is clearly a small side serving, about one-fifth of a typical serving, matching 33 g estimate. The 90% capacity limit check on assumed plate section also supports this estimation. Thus the estimate aligns well with visual and typical weights.

Step 1: Identify & locate: The target food is a slice of tarte aux fraises (strawberry tart) visible on a dessert plate. Typical single portion of a tart slice weighs around 120-180 g. Step 2: Calibrate scale: The dessert plate is about 20 cm diameter. The tart slice covers roughly one sixth of the plate area with length about 10 cm and width 6 cm. Step 3: Evaluate volume, packing, hidden depth & density: Thickness of the tart visible is about 2 cm including crust, cream, and fruit. Estimated geometric volume = 10 cm × 6 cm × 2 cm = 120 cm³. Packing factor assumed 0.85 since the tart includes dense crust, cream filling, and fruit with some air gaps. No hidden layers since slice is fully visible. Chosen density combines dense crust ~1 g/ml with cream ~0.9 g/ml and strawberry ~0.5 g/ml, approximated overall tart density around 0.85 g/ml. Effective volume = 120 × 0.85 = 102 cm³. Step 4: Mixed dish or discrete items: The slice is a single item, no discrete units. Step 5: Low-high range: Using density 0.8-0.9 g/ml, effective volume 102 cm³, weight range is 82-92 g. Implied average density = midpoint 87 g / geometric volume 120 cm³ = 0.725 g/ml. This is a bit low but consistent with presence of light cream and fruit on crust. Step 5 plausibility: The midpoint weight 87 g is about 70-75% of typical portion 120-180 g, plausible given the tart is partially eaten and the slice is not very thick. Also well below 90% dessert plate food capacity (~400 g), so fits physical limits. No corrections needed. Therefore, estimated weight is about 87 g.\",\n  \"tarte aux fraises\": 87\n}",

No visible container for oil is present in the image, indicating likely a small amount used for dressing or cooking and invisible or absorbed. Typical single serving of added oil on a plate is roughly 10-15 ml, equivalent to 9-13.5 g (density ~0.9 g/ml for oils). Since the oil is not visibly pooled or separate, it plausibly corresponds to about 10 g. The plate food portions visible are all solids or pulpy. Therefore, the oil amount is estimated by typical usage rather than direct geometric volume. Oil density used: 0.9 g/ml. Range 8-15 g to accommodate minor uncertainty. No direct geometric volume applies, so implied density is set as standard.

Reference objects are a standard dinner plate (~26-28 cm diameter) and a fork (~20 cm length). The slice covers roughly one sixth of the plate, estimating a slice size about 12 cm in length and 7 cm wide at the widest part. Step 3: Evaluate volume, packing, hidden depth & density. Thickness judging by plate rim height and shadows about 1.5 cm typical for tart slices. Geometric volume = length × width × height = 12 cm × 7 cm × 1.5 cm = 126 cm³. Since it is a baked tart with dense solid crust and fruit, packing factor ≈ 0.9 (mostly solid), hidden-layer multiplier 1.0 (visible full thickness). Choose density for baked breads & pastries ~0.40 g/cm³ on the lower side due to fruit and filling presence. Step 4: Mixed dish or discrete items. The whole slice is considered, so no sub-items. Step 5: Low-high range and sanity checks. Effective volume = 126 × 0.9 × 1.0 = 113.4 cm³. Estimated density range 0.35-0.45 g/cm³ due to variation in fruit filling. Weight low-high = 113.4 × 0.35 to 0.45 = 40 - 51 g. Implied average density = midpoint weight / geometric volume = ~45.5 / 126 = 0.36 g/cm³, plausible for a watery fruit tart slice with light crust. Checking against typical portion weights (100-150 g for a whole slice) suggests this piece is about half a normal serving size or lighter due to thinness. Step 6: Since the weight seems low for a typical tart slice, and the slice looks moderate in thickness but not very dense, adjust density higher to about 0.6 g/cm³ accounting for moisture and filling in tart (between dense bread and watery fruit). Revised weight = 113.4 × 0.6 = ~68 g, still under typical large tart slice but reasonable for this slice size and visible portion.

Assuming the bowl is a typical small serving bowl about 10 cm wide and 5 cm deep, the volume is roughly π × (5 cm)^2 × 5 cm = 392.7 cm³. The muesli fills it nearly to the top.

Geometric volume is approximated as a cylinder: area π×(10 cm)^2 ≈ 314 cm², height ~0.7 cm average thickness = 219.8 cm³. Tomatoes are dense, juicy vegetables; using a packing factor of 0.7 (some air gaps) and a hidden-layer multiplier of 1.4 (for overlapping slices and some depth hidden).

The geometric volume of cheese is roughly 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm x (assuming a height similar to width) 1.5 cm per cube, which equals about 3.4 cm³ per cube. There are 4 visible cheese cubes, so total geometric volume is approximately 13.5 cm³. The cheese cubes are solid and dense; therefore, packing factor is 1 (no air gaps). There is no hidden depth multiplier needed since the cubes are discrete units and fully visible. Cheese density is at least 1 g/ml (or 1 g/cm³). Effective volume = 13.5 cm³ × 1 × 1 = 13.5 cm³. Weight = volume × density = 13.5 g. Typical small cheese cube portion sizes range between 10-20 g, matching our estimate. The plate is large compared to the cheese, so no container capacity issues.

Implied density = midpoint / geometric volume = 118/105 ≈ 1.12 g/ml, which is high but explained by packing and depth multipliers—texture indicates loose volume but denser than raw leaves alone.

The target food is 'courgette et oignons' which corresponds to the cooked zucchini and onions portion on the left side of the glass container. Reference objects include the glass container, roughly 15 cm square based on typical kitchenware, and the wooden table. The estimated visible area filled with zucchini and onions is about 8 cm by 8 cm with a fill height of approximately 1.5 cm based on visible depth and shadows. The geometric volume is therefore 8 cm × 8 cm × 1.5 cm = 96 cubic cm. Considering it is cooked vegetables, a packing factor of 0.7 is appropriate due to the irregular shape and some air gaps. Since the vegetables pile is visible with no hidden bottom layers, the hidden layer multiplier is taken as 1.0. Effective volume thus is 96 × 0.7 × 1.0 = 67.2 cubic cm. The density of cooked vegetables typically ranges 0.6-0.8 g/ml, so applying this to effective volume gives a low-high weight range of 67.2 × 0.6 = 40 g to 67.2 × 0.8 = 54 g, midpoint 47 g. The implied average density, midpoint/geometric volume = 47/96 = 0.49 g/ml, matches reasonable expectations for cooked zucchini and onions, which have a bit lower density due to moisture and structure. Typical single portions of cooked vegetables are roughly 50-150 g, so this is plausible as a small side portion. Also, the volume fits well within the container which likely has a maximum volume of roughly 375 ml (15×15×2 cm), so the portion doesn't highly exceed 90% capacity. No adjustments needed.

The pasta is fusilli and appears cooked and moderately packed. The visible depth looks about 2 cm with some small hidden layers, so I apply a hidden-layer multiplier of 1.4 due to visible layering and some depth not directly seen.

Estimated geometric volume is 5 × 3.5 × 1.5 = 26.25 cm³. Packing factor: As this is a baked pastry with airy texture, typical packing is 0.3-0.5; I will use 0.4 for cross-check. Hidden-layer multiplier: The piece is a visible half croissant with internal crumb and air, no hidden layers beyond visible thickness, so multiplier = 1. Density: For baked breads & pastries, density is 0.25-0.45 g/ml; I choose midpoint 0.35 g/ml. Effective volume = 26.25 × 0.4 × 1 = 10.5 g (ml to g for density). Low-high range: Volume × packing × density ranges: 26.25 × 0.3 × 0.25 = 1.97 g (low) to 26.25 × 0.5 × 0.45 = 5.9 g (high). My packing factor at 0.4 and density 0.35 gives midpoint 3.675 g, which is low for a demi croissant. However, demi croissants normally weigh about half a full croissant, roughly 45-70 g full, so 22-35 g half. This estimate is much lower, so I revisit assumptions: likely underestimation in packing factor given airiness, or geometry sets too small volume. The visible piece is substantially smaller than a full half croissant, about ¼ to ⅓ in size, so weight closer to 12-15 g is plausible, adjusted from initial estimate by increasing packing factor to about 0.8 (denser due to visible thicker piece) and density to 0.35. Effective volume adjusted: 26.25 × 0.8 = 21 ml.

Step 2: Reference object used is the steel container tray, which is roughly the size of a typical lunch box tray – estimating around 20 cm in length and 14 cm width visible. The wrap measures about 18 cm long and 8 cm wide unwrapped from visible portion, somewhat folded, so unfolded length might be longer but thickness is thin. Step 3: Geometric volume: length approx 18 cm, width 8 cm, thickness around 0.2 cm (thin flatbread). Volume = 18 * 8 * 0.2 = 28.8 cm³. No hidden layers multiplier needed for single wrap, flat and thin. Packing factor for baked bread is 1 since it's a solid flatbread with no air gaps relevant to weight.

Since the bottom is somewhat visible but salad is piled, use a hidden-layer multiplier of 1.4 to allow for depth and density variation. Effective volume = 260 × 0.5 × 1.4 = 182 cm³. Density for raw leafy vegetables and salad with avocado is roughly 0.5 g/cm³, taking avocado softness into account (slightly denser). Weight estimate = 182 × 0.5 = 91 grams. Low-high range accounting for packing (0.4 - 0.6) and hidden layer uncertainty (multiplier 1.3 to 1.5) gives approximate range 75-105 grams. Implied average density 91/260 = 0.35 g/cm³, plausible given leafy salad and avocado content. Plausibility checks: typical portion of salad in meals is 70-120 grams, which fits well. At 91 g, it is far below 90% of plate capacity volume and physically reasonable. No corrections needed.\",\n  \"salade (salade verte, carottes, avocat, 1cs huile d'olive, 1 cs vinaigre)\": 91\n}",

Step 1: The target food is 'colrave crue' (raw kohlrabi), peeled and sliced into chunks. Step 2: The slices are placed on a white plastic container lid, which is about the size of a standard food container lid, around 20 cm by 12 cm. Step 3: The slices are approximately flat, with an average thickness about 1.5 cm visible. Estimating the pile geometry roughly as a single layer covering roughly half the lid area (10 cm x 12 cm = 120 cm²) with thickness 1.5 cm gives a geometric volume of about 180 cm³. Since the slices have some gaps (around packing factor 0.6), and no hidden layers, the effective volume = 180 * 0.6 = 108 cm³. Raw kohlrabi is dense like other raw vegetables, with water content, so density between 0.5 and 0.6 g/ml is reasonable. Step 4: This is a single food item, no mixing. Step 5: Weight range is 108 * 0.5 = 54 g to 108 * 0.6 = 65 g, midpoint about 60 g. Implied density is midpoint / geometric volume ~ 60 / 180 = 0.33 g/ml, somewhat low but acceptable given air gaps. Step 6: Typical raw vegetable slices portion of this size fits well. No corrections needed.\",\n  \"colrave crue\": 60\n}",
    "99": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Reference objects: plate estimated at 20 cm width (square dessert plate). Geometric volume: estimating the spinach leaves roughly as a loose pile approximately 16 cm x 10 cm x 1.5 cm thick (average thickness of fresh leaves in a loose pile). Volume = 16 x 10 x 1.5 = 240 cm³. Packing factor: fresh leafy vegetables typically 0.2 to 0.5, selected 0.35 as medium value for loose leaves. Hidden-layer multiplier: as leaves are piled loosely but not very deep, multiplier around 1.3 to account for leaves overlapping but visible, so using 1.3. Effective volume = 240 x 0.35 x 1.3 ≈ 109.2 cm³. Density for raw leafy vegetables = 0.2-0.5 g/cm³, choosing midpoint 0.35 g/cm³. Calculated weight low-high range: 240 x 0.2 x 1.3 = 62.4 g (low end) to 240 x 0.5 x 1.3 = 156 g (high end). Midpoint = 109.2 cm³ x 0.35 g/cm³ = 38.2 g; recalculated midpoint as effective volume multiplied by density is 109.2 x 0.35 = 38.2 g. Sanity checks: typical portion of fresh spinach leaves ranges 30-50 g per serving, so midpoint estimate fits well; also the pile size corresponds visually to a salad serving. No container capacity limit issues as food volume is less than plate capacity. Conclusion: estimated weight of the fresh spinach (épinards frais) in the image is approx 40 grams.\",\n  \"épinards frais\": 40\n}"
