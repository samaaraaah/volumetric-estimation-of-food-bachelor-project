It's a small to medium portion of spiral-shaped pasta mixed with visible small pieces of vegetables like green peppers, tomatoes, and corn. The pasta looks cooked but not overly dense, typical of a light pasta salad. Considering the plate diameter is standard (~25 cm), the portion occupies roughly one-sixth to one-fifth of the plate surface. The pasta pieces and vegetables combined suggest moderate density, less than cooked meat but more than leafy salad. Given the volume and density cues, a plausible weight range is 70 to 120 grams. The portion is neither very thin nor piled very high, so the thickness might be about 1 to 1.5 cm. Splitting the range and considering Swiss portion sizes as moderately compact, I estimate the salad de pâtes portion weight at about 95 grams.\",\n  \"salade de pâtes\": 95\n}",

The portion of tarte aux fraises shown is a slice with visible strawberries on top, a creamy custard layer beneath, and a thin, crisp crust at the bottom.

The crust appears thin and crumbly, contributing less weight. The cream layer looks dense and thick, suggesting moderate weight. Typical strawberry slices are light, but here they cover the top in several pieces, contributing a modest additional mass. Considering the volume and density of the cream layer, fruit, and crust, I estimate the weight of this slice to be between 110g and 140g.

The plate contains mainly solid foods with no obvious oil puddles or oily dressing pools. If the oil is present, it may be used for cooking or dressing and is not visually quantifiable as a distinct quantity.

The crust thickness is moderate and typical for a tart base. The rhubarb itself appears dense but softened by cooking, and the custard or filling layer beneath seems light and creamy but not dense. Considering the slice size relative to the plate and utensils, and typical volume of such slices, a plausible weight range would be about 110g to 140g. Choosing a midpoint weighing the fruit and crust proportionately, I estimate around 125 grams.

Given the density of granola/muesli clusters, which are compact and heavier than loose oats, and the approximate volume deduced, a reasonable weight range for the visible muesli is about 50 to 70 grams, with the midpoint being about 60 grams.

The density of tomato is mostly water, so about 0.95 g/ml, and the slices are roughly 1.5 to 2 cm thick on average. Given the visible depth and overall surface coverage, the total volume of tomato slices likely corresponds to about 250-300 grams. Considering some space and irregularities in stacking, a plausible weight range is 240-310 grams. Midpoint estimation leads to about 275 grams.

Multiplying by 5 cubes, this yields a range of 50-75 grams. Considering the visual volume and density, a midpoint estimate of 65 grams is reasonable.

Considering the volume and low density of the sprouts, a plausible weight range is between 25 grams (minimum, given the visible volume) and 40 grams (maximum, accounting for some hidden depth in the pile).

Cooked zucchini and onions are relatively low density, mostly water content, so the mass is less dense than compact steamed or fried food. Considering their portion fills about half the container volume (~450 ml total capacity), the volume of the vegetable mixture is around 200–250 ml. Given the density of cooked zucchini and onions is roughly 0.4 to 0.6 g/ml, the estimated weight ranges between 90 and 150 grams. Taking a midpoint leads to a precise estimate of about 120 grams.

The size of each galette appears roughly 6 cm in diameter and about 1.5 cm thick, which is a moderate portion size. Given the density of grains and legumes, each galette likely weighs between 40 to 55 grams, setting a minimum-maximum range of approximately 200 to 275 grams for all five. The galettes fill about half the container's volume, which seems to hold around 400-450 ml in total. Based on these observations and cross-checking with the volume of the adjacent courgette and onion mix that appears lighter and less dense, an estimated midpoint weight of around 235 grams is reasonable and plausible.

Given the container's size, which appears to be a standard medium meal prep container, the pasta occupies a volume that suggests a dense cooked pasta amount. The grated Parmesan on top adds some visual bulk but does not significantly increase weight. Considering that cooked pasta is quite dense, I estimate the weight of the pasta to be between 110 and 150 grams.

The plate size is standard, roughly 23 cm in diameter, giving us a good scale reference. Given the volume and typical density of sautéed carrots and leeks, the estimated weight range would be between 80 to 110 grams. The vegetables do not appear overly compacted nor sparse, so a midpoint estimate near 95 grams is reasonable.

Comparing their size to the gnocchi and cauliflower pieces, the eggs cover roughly the equivalent surface area of about 15-20 gnocchi pieces, but their height is less than the gnocchi's thickness, suggesting a moderate volume.

The bread thickness suggests a substantial slice rather than very thin. Each slice likely weighs around 40-50 grams due to the density of whole grain and size. Since the image shows a double sandwich, the total bread weight (both slices) would be roughly 80-100 grams. However, the estimation is only for pain bis, so I consider the sum weight of both slices.

Since the request is to estimate the weight of 'pain' (bread) visible here in total, we sum the three slices, leading to around 150 grams total for the bread portion.

Given the density of cooked spelt is about 1.2 g/cm³ (cooked grains are dense due to hydration), this suggests a weight range roughly from 300 to 350 grams.
