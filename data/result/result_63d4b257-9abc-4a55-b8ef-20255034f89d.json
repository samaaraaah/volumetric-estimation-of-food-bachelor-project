Considering the thin crust and the moderate amount of toppings, I estimate the weight of the pizza to be approximately 450 grams.\",\n  \"pizza champignons, olives, courgettes\": 450\n}",

The salad ('salade') consists of lettuce, shredded carrots, avocado, olive oil, and vinegar. The salad occupies a significant portion of the plate, with visible volume and density. Lettuce is light, while carrots and avocado add some weight. Based on the visible portion, the salad appears to weigh approximately 150-200 grams. Considering the density of the ingredients and the dressing, I estimate the weight of the salad to be 180 grams.\",\n  \"salade (salade verte, carottes, avocat, 1cs huile d'olive, 1 cs vinaigre)\": 180\n}",

The image shows raw kohlrabi ('colrave crue') cut into small, wedge-like pieces and placed on a plastic tray. The pieces are of medium thickness and appear to be evenly cut. Based on the size of the tray and the visible volume of the kohlrabi pieces, the total weight is likely between 200 and 250 grams.

    "99": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Let's work this out in a step-by-step way to be sure we have the right answer. The fresh spinach ('épinards frais') is clearly visible as the base of the salad, covering the bottom of the bowl. The leaves are whole and not chopped, and they appear to be loosely packed. Based on the size of the bowl and the visible volume of spinach, it seems to be approximately 2-3 handfuls of fresh spinach. A typical handful of fresh spinach weighs around 30 grams. Therefore, the total weight of the spinach is estimated to be in the range of 60-90 grams. Considering the visual density and the size of the bowl, I estimate the weight of the spinach to be approximately 75 grams.\",\n  \"épinards frais\": 75\n}"
