The slices appear to be standard-sized sandwich bread, toasted. Based on the visual evidence, the slices are not overly thick or dense. A typical slice of bread weighs around 25-30 grams, and since there are two slices, the total weight of the toast would be approximately 50-60 grams. Considering the visual appearance and the context, I estimate the weight of the toast to be 55 grams.\",\n\t\"toast\": 55\n}",

It is a semi-hard cheese with a visible rind and a pale interior. The piece appears to be a rectangular wedge, approximately 4-5 cm long, 3 cm wide, and about 1 cm thick. Given the density of tomme de savoie, which is moderately dense, this piece likely weighs around 20-25 grams.
