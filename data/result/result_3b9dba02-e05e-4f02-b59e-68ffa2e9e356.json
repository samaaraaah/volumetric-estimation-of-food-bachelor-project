The bowl appears to be medium-sized, and the porridge fills it to about two-thirds of its depth. Porridge is dense and compact, so its weight is relatively high compared to its volume. Based on the visible portion and the size of the bowl, I estimate the weight of the porridge to be approximately 250 grams.\",  \n\t\"porridge\": 250  \n}",

The toast appears to be standard-sized slices of bread, which are typically around 25-30 grams each when toasted. Since there are two slices visible, the total weight of the toast would be approximately 50-60 grams.

The tomme de savoie is located on the plate as the rectangular piece of cheese with a slightly darker rind and a creamy interior. It is positioned near the center of the plate. Based on its size relative to the other cheeses and the baguette slice, it appears to be a small piece, approximately 4 cm by 3 cm and about 1 cm thick.
