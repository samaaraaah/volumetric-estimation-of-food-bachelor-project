The image shows a plate containing four food items: a grilled sausage, two pieces of duck filet, a generous mound of grated carrot salad, and a portion of pasta salad with visible vegetables including celery, corn, and tomato. The salade de pâtes is positioned at the bottom left of the plate and appears to be a moist cooked pasta portion mixed with vegetables. The pasta portion covers a visible area of the plate with some thickness; it looks like a reasonably sized side portion. Considering typical Swiss cooked pasta portion sizes from 130-220 grams and comparing the pasta salad visually to the duck filet and carrot salad, the pasta salad is moderately sized but not full-heaped. I estimate an initial weight around 130-150 grams. Since pasta salads tend to be somewhat dense and moist, an upward adjustment is appropriate, but less dramatic than for dense vegetables or legumes. Therefore, choosing the upper half of the range while allowing for some density and vegetables, I estimate the weight of the salade de pâtes to be approximately 160 grams to reflect a reasonable portion size on this plate.\",\n  \"salade de pâtes\": 160\n}",

The image shows a slice of tarte aux fraises with a visible base crust, a creamy filling, topped with fresh strawberries and a few red currants. The slice looks like a typical single portion from a tart about 15-20 cm in diameter. The strawberries on top are whole or halved; there are about 7 visible strawberries each roughly weighing 15-20 grams, summing around 100-140 grams of strawberries. The creamy filling and the tart crust add additional weight, but since the question focuses on the tarte aux fraises as a whole, I include both elements. The crust appears thin but firm, estimated at about 40-50 grams. The creamy filling layer looks thick and dense, likely around 80-100 grams. Adding these together, an initial estimate would be in the range 220-290 grams. Considering the density of the pastry and creamy components, and the relatively generous amount of strawberries, I select a final estimate in the upper half of this range, about 275 grams. This aligns well with a typical medium slice of strawberry tart and seems plausible given the visible size and volume.\",\n  \"tarte aux fraises\": 275\n}",

The image shows a blue bowl containing several different foods, including a purée (likely beetroot), slices of yellow tomatoes, olives, cooked courgettes with onions, and millet patties with black beans and corn. The specified food item is 'huile de lin' (linseed oil), which is a liquid and visibly appears as a very small amount, likely drizzled or mixed in rather than forming a visible separate portion. Given that linseed oil is typically added as a finishing touch or dressing, the quantity is normally small, on the order of 1 tablespoon or less. A tablespoon (15 ml) of oil weighs approximately 13.5-14 grams. Visual clues do not show any visible pooling of oil or container, so the likely amount is less than a full tablespoon, perhaps around 1 teaspoon (5 ml), which weighs about 4.5-5 grams. Since the oil is not visibly forming a separate pool and seems to be used modestly, estimating about 5 grams is reasonable and plausible. This is consistent with typical portion sizes of oil used in this kind of dish.\",\n  \"huile de lin\": 5\n}",

The image shows a single slice of rhubarb tart on a white plate, next to a fork and a knife for size reference. The slice appears to be a roughly triangular piece, about a quarter or slightly less of a standard medium-sized tart, with visible chunks of rhubarb embedded in a custard-like filling and a pastry base. Standard whole tart sizes range around 400-600g total depending on topping and crust density. Given the density of the custard and the watery rhubarb pieces, the weight would be moderate. Estimating the slice represents about 1/6 to 1/8 of a whole tart, I initially estimate about 70-90g. Considering the custard’s density and the appreciable thickness of the rhubarb, I apply a modest upward adjustment around 40% to account for density underestimation and moisture content. This brings the estimate to approximately 100-130g. Checking plausibility against typical dessert slice weights, this is consistent. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this rhubarb tart slice to be 115 grams.\",\n  \"tarte à la rhubarbe\": 115\n}",

The quantity of red pepper slices appears to cover a small to medium area on the plate, with several thin strips visible. Considering that bell pepper pieces are relatively light, but also factoring in the density and moisture content, the visual portion here seems to be roughly half a medium bell pepper. A medium bell pepper typically weighs around 150-170 grams whole. Half of that would be approximately 75-85 grams. Given the thin slicing and some volume loss in cutting, I estimate the total weight of these red bell pepper slices to be around 80 grams.\",\n  \"poivron\": 80\n}",

The muesli clusters appear dense and compacts around the edges of the bowl, which seems to be a small to medium-sized bowl approximately 8-10 cm in diameter and about 4-5 cm deep. Given the volume and compact nature of the muesli, and knowing that muesli is dry and dense with some air pockets inside clusters, I estimate a typical serving size here to be around 60-80 grams. The bowl is quite full, but considering the space between clusters, I estimate towards the higher end of this range. Taking all visual clues and typical portion sizes into account, a reasonable estimate would be 75 grams for the portion of muesli shown.\",\n  \"muesli nature\": 75\n}",

The image shows a plate filled with sliced tomatoes, garnished with fresh herbs, sprinkled with flax seeds, and dressed with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The tomato slices cover nearly the entire plate surface with moderate thickness, suggesting a dense but not overly compact volume. A standard medium tomato weighs about 150-180 grams. Here, the quantity looks similar to roughly two medium-sized tomatoes, based on slice count and coverage. The flax seeds add minimal weight, and the liquids also add minor weight but are negligible compared to the tomatoes themselves. Considering the density and moisture content of tomatoes, the visible portion likely weighs between 250 and 300 grams. Swiss portion guidelines for fruit are around 150-300 grams, so this appears to be a full portion, slightly above average. Given the visual volume and accounting for dressing absorption, I select a final estimate at the upper half of the range, around 280 grams.\",\n  \"salade de tomates\": 280\n}",

The maréchal is visible on the plate as roughly 5 small cubes of cheese, placed on top of the salad. Each cube appears to be about 2 cm on each side, which suggests a volume around 8 cm³ per cube. Cheese density is generally about 1.0 to 1.1 g/cm³, so each cube can be estimated to weigh around 8-9 grams. With about 5 cubes, the total estimated weight is around 40-45 grams. Considering potential slight unseen parts and ensuring not to underestimate, I estimate the weight of the maréchal cheese portion at 44 grams.\",\n  \"maréchal\": 44\n}",

The sprouted seeds are spread across the middle-left area of the bowl. They appear as a dense, loosely piled cluster of thin white and green shoots, which is typical for mixed sprouts like mung bean or radish sprouts. The sprouts do not occupy the full volume of the bowl but cover a moderate area with moderate thickness, roughly 1-2 cm depth. Considering the lightweight but somewhat dense nature of sprouts, and the cluster visible, a typical portion of sprouts can range between 30-70g. Given the visual volume and density, I would estimate around 40-50g of sprouts here. Since this is a fresh, dense salad item but not heavily compacted, no major upward correction is needed beyond that range. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the weight of the pousses de graines in this dish is about 45 grams.\",\n  \"pousses de graines\": 45\n}",

The image shows a standard small container of plain yogurt (yaourt nature) next to an apple for scale. Typical Swiss single-serve yogurt pots of this size commonly contain around 120 grams. Given the container looks full and the size relative to the apple, this matches standard yogurt portions. There are no visible signs of loss or additional volume, so the weight estimate for the yaourt nature is around 120 grams.\",\n  \"yaourt nature\": 120\n}",

The vegetables appear sautéed or steamed, with visible seasoning and some moisture, indicating moderate density. They fill roughly half of the container and reach a decent depth, about 2-3 cm. Given that cooked vegetables typically have a higher density, and Swiss portions for cooked vegetables range from 150-300 grams per serving, I estimate the volume here corresponds to a portion close to the upper half of this range. Since dense vegetable dishes are often underestimated, it is critical to adjust upwards by approximately 40-60%. My initial raw estimate based on visual volume would be around 180-200 grams. After adjustment to account for density and typical underestimation, a final weight estimate around 280 grams is reasonable and plausible. The portion comfortably fits the container half without being sparse, supporting this weight estimate.\",\n  \"courgette et oignons\": 280\n}",

The galettes are compact, dense, and formed into five thick patties occupying about half of the container's volume. Each galette is roughly palm-sized, and their overall volume suggests a substantial density due to the combination of millet, beans, and corn. Given that legume-based dishes and dense grain patties often weigh more than they initially appear, I estimate each galette weighs around 55-60 grams. With five galettes, that yields a total of approximately 275-300 grams. This is consistent with Swiss portion sizes for legume and grain-based dishes and aligns with the container's size and fullness. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the galettes millet haricots noirs maïs to be 290 grams.\",\n  \"galettes millet haricots noirs maïs\": 290\n}",

Focusing on the 'pâtes', they appear to be cooked spiral pasta covered with a liberal amount of grated parmesan. The pasta portion fills roughly one-third of the rectangular container, with some thickness and volume visible. Considering Swiss cooked pasta portions typically range between 130-220g, and this portion looks like a modest but complete serving rather than a small side, I start with an estimate around 170-180g. The pasta is covered with sauce and is dense, so weight could be somewhat higher than visual volume alone indicates. There is no excessive empty space above it, so the depth is reasonably contained within the pan. Therefore, my initial range for the pasta is 160-200g. Choosing a final estimate in the upper half to reflect density and sauce, I estimate about 190 grams of pasta in this portion.\",\n  \"pâtes\": 190\n}",

The salad portion is relatively small, consisting mainly of leafy greens and a few other small vegetable pieces. Leafy salads typically weigh between 50-100g per serving. This portion is modest, occupying about one quarter of the plate area compared to the risotto portion. Given the visible amount and the fact that leafy salads are low density, I estimate this salad weighs near the lower end of the typical range. Taking into account the visible size and volume, I estimate the salad portion at approximately 60 grams. This is consistent with the visible quantity of leaves and dressing on the salad.\",\n  \"salade\": 60\n}",

The image shows a plate with three distinct food items: white cooked rice, a piece of white fish (poisson), and sautéed vegetables consisting mainly of carrots and leeks (légumes sautés). The sautéed vegetables occupy a portion roughly equivalent to a small pile on one side of the plate. The vegetables appear cooked, thus fairly dense and moist, which means their weight will be higher than their apparent volume suggests. Considering typical Swiss portions for cooked vegetables range between 150-300g, and dense sautéed vegetables should be adjusted upward by 40-60% due to underestimation, the visible portion looks closer to a moderate serving rather than a large heap. Visually, the sautéed vegetables cover about one fifth to one quarter of the plate, and are somewhat thick with both carrot slices and chopped leeks. Initial estimate based on volume and density could be around 120-160g, but applying the 40-60% correction for dense cooked vegetables, the estimate should be raised significantly. Accounting for this correction and comparing to the rice and fish portions, I estimate the weight of the sautéed vegetables to be approximately 230 grams.\",\n  \"légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)\": 230\n}",

The scrambled eggs (oeufs brouillés) occupy about one third of the plate and appear fluffy but reasonably dense. The portion size looks like it was made from approximately 2-3 medium eggs, which typically weigh around 50g each raw, but cooking concentrates the mass slightly. Given the fluffed texture, the weight is less than whole raw eggs but still substantial. Considering standard Swiss servings of scrambled eggs tend to be around 120-180g for one portion, and the visual amount looks moderate but not small, I estimate the scrambled eggs weigh toward the lower-middle of this range. The presence of gnocchi and cauliflower on the same plate helps gauge overall plate size. The eggs spread over a reasonable part of the plate, but are not piled high.

The pesto amount on top is moderate, roughly a spoonful, which might weigh about 30-40 grams but the target food is only spaghetti. The grated gruyère is sparsely sprinkled and would add negligible volume to the spaghetti mass. Hence, focusing on the spaghetti alone and considering visual fullness and typical density, the spaghetti portion weighs around 190 grams, which is in the upper half of the normal cooked pasta Swiss range and consistent with the size and visual volume shown.\",\n  \"spaghetti\": 190\n}",

This waffle appears not too thick but fully cooked, with a standard size about 10x12 cm approximated by the plate design and the visible tableware. Since the compote is an additional item but the task is only for the 'gaufre', we only estimate the waffle itself. I would estimate the waffle weight closer to 110 grams, as it looks denser than a thin waffle but not very thick or heavy. This aligns with Swiss portion sizes for waffles and visual cues.

Given the plate size and spread of the pasta, the sauce appears to be roughly 150-200 grams in volume. Considering sauce bolognese is a dense, cooked vegetable and meat mix with tomato sauce, it has a high density close to 0.8-1 g/ml. Swiss reference portions for meat-based sauces range around 120-180g, but since this sauce looks quite generous and dense, and given the tendency to underestimate dense vegetable/meat dishes by 40-60%, I increase the estimated weight accordingly.

Given these spears look medium-sized and cooked (which adds some water content), I estimate each spear to weigh around 18 grams. Multiplying by 8 spears gives an initial total of around 144 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes for cooked vegetables are 150-300 grams and asparagus can be dense due to water content, this estimate seems plausible. Since asparagus is not as dense as legume or stew dishes, I apply a modest adjustment upwards but not as large as the 40-60% recommended for dense vegetables.

The thickness appears substantial, approximately 4 cm or more. Given the typical density and moisture content of tiramisu, a piece this size usually weighs around 150-220 grams. Since the slice looks quite generous and dense with moist layers, I will choose a weight in the upper half of this range, around 200 grams, as tiramisus tend to be underestimated.

The total visible portion is quite small—roughly equivalent to about 6-8 penne pieces and some scattered vegetable bits. A typical cooked pasta portion weighs 130-220g, but this is clearly a leftover/little remaining amount on the plate rather than a full serving. Given the size of the plate and relative size of each pasta piece, this looks like roughly one-quarter or less of a usual portion, visually equivalent to about 40-60g of pasta salad.

A typical thin butter spread on one slice of bread usually weighs around 5 to 10 grams depending on thickness and coverage. Given the visible coverage and thickness here, I estimate about 6-7 grams of butter per slice. Since the prompt asks for the butter weight (not specifying if it's one or both slices, but typically butter spread per slice is estimated), I will assume the total butter visible across both slices.
