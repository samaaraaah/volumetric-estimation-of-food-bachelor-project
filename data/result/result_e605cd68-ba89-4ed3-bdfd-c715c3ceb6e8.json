The image shows a small blue bowl containing a creamy, smooth caramel custard (crème caramel). The portion appears to be spread thinly at the bottom of the bowl without filling the container deeply. Considering the bowl size relative to the person's fingers and leg (visible as a reference for scale), the volume of custard is modest—roughly about 70-90 ml in volume. Crème caramel has a density similar to a dairy cream dessert, close to 1 g/ml. Therefore, the weight should approximate the volume in grams. Given the spread and depth, the portion is a small-to-medium serving typical in Swiss context, closer to 80 grams. There are no large extra pieces or additions to increase mass, and the custard's light, smooth texture also confirms density consistency. Thus, I estimate the weight of the crème caramel to be approximately 80 grams.\",\n  \"crème caramel\": 80\n}",

The image shows a slice of 'délice des dieux', a layered dessert composed of biscuit base, red fruits, and a creamy layer of séré and mascarpone. The portion is on a small dessert plate, which gives a size reference: the slice is roughly 8 cm by 6 cm in surface area. The thickness of the slice is about 2.5 cm, including the biscuit and creamy topping. The biscuit layer appears moist and compact, typical of a dense sponge soaked with fruit juices. The fruits are integrated mostly in the biscuit layer (red color), with a few whole raspberries and blueberries on top. Considering the cream layer which is dense but light, and the biscuit base which is denser, I estimate an average density between a cake and a creamy dessert, approximately 0.9 to 1.0 g/cm3. Volume is roughly 8 cm × 6 cm × 2.5 cm = 120 cm3. Multiplying volume by density gives an estimated weight range of 108 to 120 grams. Since the portion appears average-sized (not too small or overly large), a medium portion leads me to select the mid value, approximately 115 grams. There is no container weight to consider, and the visible red fruits on top are included within the portion. Therefore, the weight of the 'délice des dieux' slice is estimated at around 115 grams.\",\n  \"délice des dieux (biscuit, fruits rouges, séré+mascarpone)\": 115\n}",

Each piece is roughly quarter of a small waffle, about 8 cm x 6 cm in size and approximately 1.5 cm thick. Sweet potato waffles tend to be denser than typical waffles due to the sweet potato content. A full small sweet potato waffle would typically weigh around 140-160 grams. Considering that the four pieces together correspond to the entire waffle, I estimate the total weight is around 150 grams. The sauce, smoked salmon, and other ingredients are not included in this estimate as per instructions, only the waffle is considered.\",\n  \"gaufre à la patate douce\": 150\n}",

In the image, the tomates are cut into irregular chunks mixed with cucumber pieces on a small plate. Visually, there are about 8 visible chunks of tomato, each about 2-3 cm in dimension, with some depth. Tomatoes are dense, juicy, and moderately heavy. The tomatoes occupy roughly one-third of the total volume of the visible salad. Considering the plate size, which is likely a standard small plate of around 20 cm diameter, the total quantity of tomatoes corresponds to a small side portion. Typical weight for a medium tomato is about 100-150 grams whole, and the portion shown looks like roughly one-third to half of a medium tomato. Therefore, estimating based on visual size and volume, the weight of the tomatoes on this plate is approximately 50 grams.\",\n  \"tomates\": 50\n}",

The image shows a plate divided roughly into three portions of food: boiled spiral pasta on the left, a portion of chili with visible cervelas pieces and red kidney beans on the right, and a small dollop of crème fraîche between the two. The target food, chili, consists of cooked cervelas sausage pieces, kidney beans, and chili sauce. Visually, the chili occupies about half of the plate's surface area on one side, piled in a somewhat thick layer with visible chunks. The plate appears to be a standard medium-sized plate (around 23 cm diameter), providing scale for volume estimation. Compared to the pasta portion of dense, cooked spirals, the chili is also dense, with solid sausage pieces adding to mass and volume. Considering a typical Swiss portion size (smaller than US), and the visible volume and density of the chili including the sausage and beans, the weight likely ranges between 180-230 grams. Taking a middle estimate in this range to remain conservative and consistent with visual evidence, a good estimation is about 210 grams for the chili portion without container weight. This accounts for depth and visible chunk volume, avoiding underestimation of the sausage pieces and bean density.\",\n  \"chili\": 210\n}",

The courgettes are sliced into medium-sized chunks mixed with onion pieces, both cooked and appearing soft and slightly moist. The container is small, approximately 12x12 cm square, common for meal prep portions. The courgette and onion portion occupies about half of the container volume, heaped but not overflowing. Considering the density of cooked courgettes and onions, which are moderately dense but retain water content reducing weight, the depth can be estimated around 3-4 cm. Visually, the portion is medium-sized by Swiss standards, not particularly large or small. Based on typical density roughly 0.8 g/cm3 for cooked mixed vegetables, and approximating volume as 12x6 cm x 3.5 cm deep = about 250 cm3. Multiplying volume by density gives approximately 200 grams. I consider this a reasonable internal weight range for a cooked vegetable portion of this size and type.

Considering the average size and the 18 count, the total estimated weight is around 21-23 grams. The nuts appear dry and dense, consistent with unsalted raw cashews. Since the nuts fill the palm without being heaped, the portion corresponds to a small-to-medium serving typical in Switzerland.

The plate is a standard size, roughly 24 cm in diameter, providing a scale reference. The mashed potatoes are about 12 cm long and 7-8 cm wide, with an estimated depth of about 2 cm given the slight mound shape. Mashed potatoes have a moderate density, denser than fluffier foods but lighter than solid meat. Considering the portion is roughly a rectangle around 12x8x2 cm, this results in approximately 192 cm³ volume. Given the density of mashed potatoes is about 0.8 g/cm³, the estimated weight is around 150 grams. This looks like a medium portion, neither very small nor very large, so 150 grams is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the purée de pdt to be approximately 150 grams.\",\n  \"purée de pdt\": 150\n}",

Blueberries are dense, with typical individual weight of approximately 1 to 1.3 grams each in small Swiss portions. Comparing them to the porridge and the hand holding the bowl, each blueberry is about 1.3 cm in diameter, consistent with average blueberries in Switzerland. Given the count and density, the total weight is likely between 11 and 14 grams.

The tiramisu includes layers of soaked sponge cake and creamy mascarpone mixture, which is relatively dense but also somewhat light due to the cream. Considering these dimensions and densities, the weight should be moderate. The tiramisu is roughly the size of a typical Swiss individual dessert portion which usually weighs less than US portions. Taking into account the depth and density, the weight likely falls between 140 to 180 grams.

The banana segment is approximately half the length of a typical banana, judging by the visible texture and curvature. Its thickness and diameter appear consistent with a medium-sized banana. A whole medium banana typically weighs about 120-130 grams including peel, and the edible portion is around 100-110 grams. Since this banana is peeled and about half the usual length, the weight should be roughly half of the edible portion of a full banana. Therefore, estimating conservatively for a Swiss portion size, I estimate the weight of this peeled banana portion to be around 50-60 grams, with 55 grams as a reasonable midpoint estimate.\",\n  \"banane\": 55\n}",

The dish includes penne pasta with cream sauce and small pieces of bacon or pancetta. On top, there is a visible pile of grated gruyère cheese although the estimation must focus only on the 'pâtes carbonara', meaning the pasta with sauce and bacon, excluding the cheese. Step 1: The pasta appear to be a moderate portion, roughly spread in a 15-18 cm diameter area in the center of the plate. Step 2: Considering the thickness of the pasta layer and the presence of sauce, which adds moisture and density, the volume seems to be about 1 to 1.5 cm thick on average over the area. Step 3: The pasta is cooked and mixed with sauce and bacon, making it relatively dense. Typical cooked pasta portions in Switzerland tend to be smaller than US portions, so this looks like a medium portion. Step 4: Estimating based on visual size against the plate, the pasta component weighs approximately between 150 and 190 grams. Since the pasta fills a moderate part of the plate with sauce and bits of bacon, a reasonable middle ground estimate is about 170 grams. Step 5: The cheese on top is excluded from the estimate as per instructions. Step 6: Checking if this weight is logical in relation to a typical Swiss meal portion; given the pasta amount on the plate, 170 grams of cooked pasta carbonara is consistent and realistic. Final estimate: 170 grams for the 'pâtes carbonara' portion on the plate.\",\n  \"pâtes carbonara\": 170\n}",

The galette wrap is fully visible on a standard-sized plate, which provides a good reference for its dimensions. The wrap appears to be a typical whole wheat galette, roughly 20-22 cm in diameter. Galette wraps from Swiss portions are generally thinner and smaller than US tortillas. The thickness is very thin, as usual for galette wraps. Based on standard nutritional data and visual comparison to the size of the utensils and plate, a single galette wrap of this size and type commonly weighs between 55 and 70 grams. Considering the visible size and thickness here, and that the wrap looks fresh and not overly dry or thick, I opt for a medium portion estimation near the middle of this range. Thus, the weight estimate is about 65 grams.\",\n  \"galette wraps\": 65\n}",

The slice shows roughly 6 large strawberry halves on top and some red currants embedded in the cream filling. Step 1: Counting the strawberries, there are 6 halves, roughly equivalent to 3 whole strawberries. Step 2: The strawberries are fresh, dense fruit. An average medium strawberry weighs about 15-20 grams, so 3 strawberries would be approximately 45-60 grams. Step 3: Considering the cream and pastry, only the strawberries themselves should be estimated here. Step 4: With slight partial coverage of cream on some strawberries, assume about 90% fruit volume is visible and weighted. Step 5: Adjusting for Swiss portion sizes and visual clues, strawberry weight on the slice is about 50 grams. Step 6: Cross-verifying the strawberry size relative to typical strawberry size confirms this estimate is reasonable.

The target food is a single slice of toast ('tartine') with visible spread of chestnut cream ('crème de marrons') and butter. Step 1, visual identification: The slice is alone on a plate with some crumbs around, indicating it is a standard-sized slice of toasted bread. The spread covers most of the slice's surface but not thickly piled. Step 2, dimension analysis: The plate is a standard white ceramic plate, about 25 cm in diameter. The slice is roughly 10 cm long and 5-6 cm wide with moderate thickness of toasted bread, estimated about 1.5 cm thick. Step 3, density considerations: Toasted bread density is about 0.3-0.4 g/cm³; the chestnut cream is denser, similar to a thick jam (about 1.3 g/cm³); the butter spread is light but dense (about 0.9 g/cm³). Step 4, portion size calibration: The toast slice itself likely weighs around 30 grams given its size and toasted density. The spread seems thinly applied; around half a tablespoon (about 8 grams) of chestnut cream and roughly 5 grams of butter. Step 5, cross-validation: The total weight estimated by adding bread (30g), chestnut cream (8g), and butter (5g) gives about 43 grams. Since the crust and crumbs are visible and the spread is moderate, this estimate aligns well with the visible volume and density. Therefore, I estimate the combined weight of the tartine with chestnut cream and butter to be approximately 43 grams.\",\n  \"tartine avec crème de marrons et beurre\": 43\n}",

It is a single solid piece, fully visible, not mixed or layered with other foods. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The piece is roughly comparable in length to the two small croissants (each about 6-7 cm long) and slightly thinner. I estimate the gruyère to be about 12 cm long, about 2 cm wide, and approximately 1.5 cm thick, given its solid shape and visual depth compared to the croissants and bread pieces. Step 3: Density Considerations - Gruyère is a dense cheese with an approximate density around 1.1 g/cm³. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Multiplying estimated volume (12 × 2 × 1.5 = 36 cm³) by density (1.1 g/cm³) gives about 39.6 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - Compared to the salami slices and bread pieces, this weight is consistent, as the cheese is a substantial but moderate piece. Step 6: Systematic Bias Check - The piece is solid, not airy, so no underestimation of density; dimensions considered conservatively, so no overestimation.

In Step 2, comparing to the roast meat slices and the plate, the quantity of sauce seems light, approximately covering an area of about 8 cm by 4 cm with a thin layer about 0.3 cm thick, which suggests low volume. Step 3 considers density—the sauce is mostly onions cooked down and likely combined with some liquid; its density is moderate but less than dense meats. Step 4 contextualizes portion size as modest, typical of a Swiss small-to-medium portion. Step 5 cross-validates against other foods: the sauce volume is clearly less than any salad or the meat itself. Step 6 relative weight: the sauce is around 1/10th the weight of the roast portion, which itself probably weighs around 120 grams.

They appear plump and glossy, indicating cooked beans, which are dense. Counting individual beans roughly results in about 35-40 pieces. Each cooked kidney bean weighs approximately 1.5-2 grams on average. Multiplying by 40 beans gives a weight range of about 60-80 grams. Given this is a single moderate-looking portion on a standard-sized plate (about 22-24 cm diameter) which is typical in Swiss meals (smaller portions generally than US servings), I consider 70 grams a reasonable estimate for the portion of haricots rouges present.\",\n  \"haricots rouges\": 70\n}",

The salad consists of small diced pieces of vegetables such as cucumber, tomato, yellow bell pepper, and some pieces of white cheese (likely feta), as well as a few olives. The salad appears to be roughly half to two-thirds full in the container. Given the size of the container (roughly the size of a typical takeaway container, about 15 cm length, 10 cm width, and filled about 4 cm in depth), the volume occupied by the salad should be approximately 600 cubic centimeters. Greek salad is composed mostly of fresh vegetables and cheese with some dressing, which combined have a density close to 1g/cm3. Considering some dressing and moisture but also air gaps between pieces, the density might slightly be less. Therefore, the weight estimate for this portion of salade grecque is around 600 grams, but given the container is not fully filled and some air spaces, I estimate a slightly lower value, about 500 grams total. Since the target is just the salade grecque without any external dressing container, this figure applies fully to the salad inside.

The cookie appears moderately thick, around 1-1.5 cm, with dense chocolate chunks embedded. Considering cookie density usually ranges from 0.8 to 1.1 grams per cm³ and this cookie looks homemade with visible chunks, it is denser than a thin crispy cookie but less dense than a cake.

Step 2: Dimension analysis shows that the puff pastry is roughly the size of a small pastry bite, approximately 4-5 cm wide, about 3-4 cm deep, and around 2-3 cm in thickness based on the visible layers and typical puff pastry structure. The surface visible and overall volume are small, consistent with a snack-sized portion. Step 3: Considering density, puff pastry is light but layered with some fat, and tomato sauce adds minimal weight. Therefore, the overall density is moderate but the volume is small. Step 4: Swiss portion sizes are generally smaller; this appears to be a single small piece. Typical small puff pastry hors d'oeuvres range from 20-40 grams. Step 5: There are no other items to compare visually, so the weight estimation strictly relies on this single piece. Step 6: Avoid overestimation due to the delicate, airy texture of the pastry.

The tomato slices are medium thickness, roughly 1-1.5 cm each, and tomatoes have a density of about 0.95 g/cm3, while mozzarella is denser, roughly 1.1 g/cm3. Visually, the whole stack is about 15 cm long and 6 cm wide, with a thickness averaging about 2.5 cm (since the slices overlap slightly). Considering the volume, this is roughly a cylinder-like shape of 15 cm x 6 cm x 2.5 cm, which is 225 cm3 approximately. Since the volume includes both tomato and mozzarella, and they alternate roughly equally, about half the volume is tomato and half mozzarella. For the tomato half, volume would be about 112.5 cm3 x 0.95 g/cm3 ≈ 107 g. For the mozzarella half, 112.5 cm3 x 1.1 g/cm3 ≈ 124 g. Total estimated mass would then be around 230-235 grams.

Using a rough calculation: a 20 cm diameter area covered by 0.25 cm depth gives about 78.5 cm² * 0.25 cm = 19.6 cm³ of sauce approximately, which is close to 20 grams since sauce density is near water. The sauce also penetrates some of the mashed potatoes and meat, but this does not significantly add volume visible on the plate.

Visually, the quantity of onion on the bread is modest, roughly spread over the slice and limited in depth and volume. The green onion pieces seem to weigh very little as they are thin and sparse. Compared to other items on the plate (bread with ham, slices of salami, and two radishes), the onion has the smallest volume. Considering the density of onion (about 0.9 grams per cubic centimeter), and the visible quantity which is approximately a small handful or about 1-2 tablespoons chopped, a reasonable weight range for the onion on this plate is between 5 and 10 grams.

Step 3: Density Considerations - Being vegetable-based meatballs, they have a medium density, somewhat lighter than meat but heavier than pasta. I estimate about 0.9 g/cm³ density for each boulettes. Volume of one boulettes = 4/3 * π * (1.5)^3 ≈ 14.1 cm³. Weight per boulettes ≈ 14.1 * 0.9 ≈ 12.7 grams. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - 9 boulettes × 12.7 g = 114 grams approximately. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Comparing the volume of boulettes to pasta portion (which looks like about 120-140 grams cooked), the boulettes volume and weight seems reasonable, about equal or slightly less than the pasta portion. Step 6: Bias Check - There is some sauce on them but I exclude it's weight beyond coating. No visible parts hidden or missing.

The cornichon pieces mixed within are small but add to the mass slightly. The fromage (cheese) pieces appear embedded within the pasta salad and are not visible separately as cubes or slices, so their weight is part of the salad. The tomate is a single small cherry tomato on a skewer, visually about 2.5-3 cm in diameter and standard density. One small cherry tomato typically weighs around 15-20 grams. Overall, the pasta salad portion seems medium-sized and dense, with an estimated weight between 100 to 130 grams considering Swiss portion sizes. The single cornichon slices visible inside the salad are included in this estimate. The cherry tomato weighs about 18 grams, and since it's served separately on the skewer, it should be considered independently and not included in the salade de pâtes estimate. Since the target is salade de pâtes, cornichon, fromage, tomate together, and the cornichon and fromage are incorporated into the pasta salad, their weight is included in the estimate for the salad. The cherry tomato is a single piece weighing about 18 grams. Therefore, combining pasta salad including cornichon and cheese (~120 grams) plus one cherry tomato (~18 grams), the total estimate is about 138 grams.

The pasta portion occupies about one-quarter of the plate's surface area and is moderately piled, with visible ribbon pasta (likely tagliatelle or fettuccine) appearing cooked and moist with mushroom sauce. The pasta strands are relatively wide but not densely packed, likely resulting in some air gaps. The depth of the pasta pile is roughly estimated at about 1.5-2 cm. Considering cooked pasta density (which is high due to water absorption), a portion covering about 1/4 of a 24 cm plate with a modest pile usually weighs between 100 to 130 grams. Given the Swiss portion context, these portions tend to be on the smaller side. Comparing the pasta visually to the courgettes gratinée portion which is smaller in volume but denser, the pasta appears about twice the volume of the courgettes, further supporting a weight around 110-120 grams.

A small to medium bell pepper typically weighs between 100 and 150 grams raw, but after cooking and some parts removed (seeds and core), the edible portion here is less. Since the pepper is hollowed out and roasted, with two slices visible plus the main body, I estimate the total weight of the yellow pepper flesh to be around 60-80 grams.

Given the low density of such creamy condiments, and based on the small visual quantity compared to the other items on the plate, the total weight of the crème balsamique is small. Estimating this balsamic cream amount as roughly one to two teaspoons (about 5-10 ml), and considering cream density near water (about 1 g/ml), the likely weight is around 6 grams, balancing between the visible spread and typical serving size for such a condiment on an open sandwich.\",\n  \"crème balsamique\": 6\n}",

The thickness of the bread appears moderate, around 1.5-2 cm, with an open crumb typical of this bread type. Step 3: Density considerations note that multigrain bread is moderately dense but contains air pockets, so the density is lower than a compact bread. Standard density approximations for this type of bread are about 250-280g per 300 cm3. Step 4: Portion size calibration means that two such pieces together form roughly one large slice of bread. A whole standard slice of this kind of bread weighs between 35-45 grams, considering European/Swiss portion sizes are smaller than US ones. Comparing this to the visual evidence and thickness, these two combined pieces would weigh slightly less than or equal to a single slice of similar bread. Step 5: Cross-validation against the chocolate spread showed the spread layer is thin and does not add bulk to the bread weight.

The rhubarb chunks are numerous and each about 2-3 cm long, contributing to the overall weight. The slice thickness appears to be around 2.5-3 cm. Considering the density of the pastry base (a typical shortcrust or similar) and the cooked rhubarb, the density is moderate, with the fruit pieces adding moisture and weight. Judging the portion as a typical Swiss cake slice size (smaller than American portions), the weight likely ranges between 150 to 220 grams.

There are no additional piles of spread or dollops, just a single thin layer mostly within the waffle grid. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The waffle section serves as a reference; its thickness is about 1.5 to 2 cm. The chocolate spread mostly fills the surface indentations but with some smooth spread on the surface. Given the photo’s scale, the spread seems to have a thickness ranging approximately from 1 to 3 millimeters on average across the waffle. Step 3: Density Considerations - Chocolate hazelnut spreads are dense and fairly heavy for their volume, with an approximate density of 1.1 g/cm³. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Estimating the waffle size to be about 10 cm by 10 cm, the area is roughly 100 cm². Assuming an average spread thickness of 0.15 cm (1.5 mm) over this area gives 100 cm² * 0.15 cm = 15 cm³ volume. Multiplying by density of 1.1 g/cm³ gives approximately 16.5 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Given typical Swiss portion practices, a thin coating like this usually weighs between 12 and 18 grams. Our estimate fits well within this range based on visual evidence. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - The spread visually occupies less volume and weight than the waffle itself, which seems consistent with the thin spread observed.

This slice is a typical medium-sized, single portion of bread, perfectly consistent with a light meal. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the pain to be 50 grams.\",\n  \"pain\": 50\n}",

The cereal pieces appear to be a mix of flakes and small clusters. The bowl size is typical of a small breakfast bowl, and the amount of cereal visible covers the bottom with some layering but not a deep pile. Considering the density of dry cereals, which is relatively light but compact, and estimating the volume as roughly 1 to 1.5 cm depth over the bowl base (approximately 10 cm diameter), the volume roughly corresponds to about 60 to 80 grams of cereal before milk absorption. Milk weight is excluded per instructions. Given the Swiss portion context is smaller than US portions, this appears to be a modest serving.

The target food item is \\\"côtes de bettes à la sauce tomate,\\\" which is the Swiss chard stems with tomato sauce visible at the bottom of the bowl. Step 1: The \\\"côtes de bettes\\\" appear as a leafy and stemmy vegetable, cooked down with a tomato-based sauce. The leaves and stems are limp but clearly recognizable, occupying the lower half of the bowl. Step 2: The bowl itself is medium-sized and the \\\"côtes de bettes\\\" take up approximately half of the bowl's volume, with both leaves and stems submerged in a watery tomato sauce. The visual depth suggests a moderate volume, not thinly spread but a compact portion. Step 3: Swiss chard (côtes de bettes) cooked is dense but watery, and with tomato sauce adds some moisture weight. The density is moderate; this is a cooked vegetable dish where water content is high but significant volume is held by stems and leaves. Step 4: Considering Swiss portion sizes, this serving represents a medium portion of cooked vegetables. Step 5: Cross-checking with the omelette portion visible on top (which would weigh more, possibly around 90-100g), the \\\"côtes de bettes\\\" portion appears roughly equal or slightly less in volume but watery and dense, so likely weighs in the 130-160g range. Step 6: Taking all into account, the portion size, density, volume, and comparing to typical vegetable servings in Swiss context, I estimate the \\\"côtes de bettes à la sauce tomate\\\" to weigh approximately 145 grams.\",\n  \"côtes de bettes à la sauce tomate\": 145\n}",

The bowl size is standard, approximately 18-20 cm in diameter, and the quinoa depth appears to be about 1.5 to 2 cm thick where it's densely packed. Cooked quinoa is fairly dense for a grain but not as dense as meat. Estimating the volume of quinoa as roughly half the bowl base area (about 120 cm²) times 1.5 cm depth gives about 180 cm³. The density of cooked quinoa is approximately 0.9 g/cm³. Multiplying gives 162 grams as an approximate weight. Considering some loose scattered grains and slight variation in depth, the portion corresponds to a medium Swiss portion size, around 150-170 grams.

The butter layer thickness looks about 2-3 mm on a small bread slice roughly 7 cm in diameter. Butter is dense, approximately 0.9 g/cm3. Estimating the spread surface area at about 25 cm2 and a thickness of ~0.25 cm gives a volume around 6.25 cm3 which converts roughly to 5.5-6 grams.

The blocks are dense and firm, typical of tofu, and have a yellowish tint consistent with mango seasoning. Each block likely weighs between 25-30 grams given typical tofu density and size. Multiplying 6 blocks by an average of 27 grams per block yields approximately 160 grams. Considering some blocks are partially hidden or smaller, but also accounting for possible air gaps between pieces, a balanced estimate centers around 160 grams.

Each brioche is roughly spherical and about the size of a small bakery bun, approximately 7-8 cm in diameter. Compared to a standard Swiss portion for brioche au chocolat, these seem fairly small, likely homemade or artisanal size. Typically, a small brioche au chocolat weighs around 70-90 grams. Visual cues such as the compactness and visible chocolate chunks suggest a medium density, consistent with brioche dough. Considering the portion size smaller than US large bakery rolls, I estimate each brioche au chocolat here to be roughly 80 grams.

Considering the size of the spoon handle and the bowl as references, this bowl looks small, typical of a dessert portion in Swiss context. Each strawberry piece roughly translates to about 10-12 grams due to strawberry density and size, but since they are cut, losing some volume, an average of 10 grams per piece is reasonable.

Visually, the gratin occupies roughly a quarter of the plate's surface area, with an estimated thickness of about 2-3 cm, judging by the height relative to the pasta nearby. Swiss portion sizes tend to be moderate, so the gratin is neither overly large nor sparse. Considering that cooked chard stems and leaves combined with cream and cheese create a moderately dense dish, the density is higher than raw vegetables but not as dense as pure meat. Estimating volume, the gratin piece approximates 8x6 cm in surface dimensions and about 2.5 cm thick, yielding roughly 120 cm^3 in volume. Assuming a typical density for vegetable gratins around 1 g/cm^3, the weight is close to 120 grams. Given that some volume is air and cheese topping might add slight additional weight, I allow for 10-20% margin, giving a calibrated portion weight of about 130 grams for this gratin. Cross-validation compared to the pasta portion indicates this estimate is reasonable as the gratin is visibly less voluminous but denser.\",\n  \"gratin de côtes de bettes\": 130\n}",

A typical medium apple in Swiss portion context weighs between 150 and 180 grams. The apple's round shape and thickness are consistent with this range. There are no visible cuts or missing portions, and the skin is intact, so full weight is considered.
