The pasta salad portion is located at the bottom left of the plate and consists of curly pasta with visible small pieces of vegetables like tomatoes, corn, and green pepper. Comparing to the other items on the plate, the portion size looks moderate but not large, roughly occupying about one-sixth of the plate surface. Pasta is voluminous but less dense, so the visual volume should be converted appropriately to weight. Given the size of a standard dinner plate (around 25 cm diameter), and the portion shown, the pasta salad likely weighs between 70 to 110 grams. Considering the moderate portion—neither very small nor full-sized—and factoring in some dressing that adds modest weight, a reasonable estimate would be about 90 grams for the pasta salad.\",\n  \"salade de pâtes\": 90\n}",

The strawberries are substantial in size, typical of fresh strawberries, and there are about 7 halves visible. The cream layer looks thick but not overly dense, and the pastry base is crumbly with a few crumbs on the plate. Given the size relative to the plate and the thickness of different layers, this slice appears to be a medium portion. Typical strawberry tortes with cream and pastry crust usually weigh between 120 and 160 grams for a medium slice. Considering the volume of strawberries and cream observed here, I estimate the slice weighs around 140 grams. This fits well with typical single-serving dessert sizes and the visible composition without over or underestimating the density and volume of the components.\",\n  \"tarte aux fraises\": 140\n}",

The image shows a plate with several distinct food items, including a cluster of black olives at the bottom and some drizzle or small amount of oil on the olives that could be the 'huile de lin' (linseed oil). Typically, linseed oil would be used as a dressing or drizzled over food, appearing as a thin glossy layer or small pool of oil on or around the ingredients. There is no visible bottle or container, and the oil is likely minimal in quantity due to its strong flavor and typical usage as a condiment rather than a main ingredient. Given the visual appearance and typical usage amounts, the amount of linseed oil on the plate looks to be roughly equivalent to a small teaspoon or less. A teaspoon of oil weighs about 4.5 grams. Since the amount here looks small but clearly visible, not overly abundant, a reasonable estimation range would be 3-6 grams. Selecting a middle ground value for a modest drizzle, I estimate the linseed oil weight to be approximately 5 grams.\",\n  \"huile de lin\": 5\n}",

The slice covers roughly a quarter of a typical tart size, which typically weighs around 300-350 grams when whole. The rhubarb pieces are visible and embedded in a custard-like filling on a pastry crust. Considering the density and volume of the ingredients, and that the slice is about one quarter of a normal tart, the weight should be around 80 to 95 grams.

The portions look to be from roughly half of a medium-sized red bell pepper, considering typical Swiss portion sizes and the relative size compared to the adjacent chicken pieces and avocado slices. A full medium bell pepper weighs about 120-150 grams fresh; cooking reduces water content, making the weight slightly less. Given the sautéed appearance and the amount visible (about half of the pepper), I estimate the weight range to be between 50 and 70 grams. A midpoint estimate of about 60 grams fits well with the portion size and visual density.\",\n  \"poivron\": 60\n}",

Considering the density of muesli, about 0.4-0.5 g/ml, the total weight would be between 60 and 90 grams for this portion. The portion looks medium-sized, not overly packed but with clustered granola pieces filling the bowl. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the weight of the muesli nature shown is about 75 grams.\",\n  \"muesli nature\": 75\n}",

The plate is a standard medium-sized ceramic plate, approximately 23 cm in diameter, and the tomatoes are cut into wedges and slices. The tomato pieces cover the whole plate surface densely but are relatively thin slices. Given the density and water content of tomatoes, and the volume occupied on the plate, the tomatoes likely come from about 3 medium-sized tomatoes. A medium tomato typically weighs about 100-130 grams. The presence of dressing like olive oil and balsamic vinegar adds negligible weight. Flax seeds are only a small garnish and weigh very little here. Therefore, the total weight of the tomato salad is estimated between 280 and 350 grams. Choosing a midpoint and considering some weight loss due to slicing and juice loss, I estimate the total weight of the salade de tomates to be 320 grams.\",\n  \"salade de tomates\": 320\n}",

The target food item is 'maréchal', which visually corresponds to the small yellow cheese cubes placed on the plate near the cucumber slices and salad leaves. There are about five small cubes of cheese visible. Each cube appears to be roughly 1.5 cm on each side, and considering the density of a typical semi-hard cheese like Maréchal (a Swiss cheese type), each cube is likely around 10-12 grams. Multiplying by five cubes gives a range of approximately 50-60 grams. Since the cubes look uniform and not cut very thick, this is a reasonable estimate. Compared to the other food items on the plate (two boiled eggs, leafy salad, and cucumber slices), the cheese portion is moderate but not large. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'maréchal' cheese to be around 55 grams, safely within the 50-60 grams range.\",\n  \"maréchal\": 55\n}",

The image shows a bowl containing a salad composed of fresh spinach leaves ('épinards frais'), cherry tomatoes ('tomates cerises'), sprouted seeds ('pousses de graines'), and falafels ('fallafels'). The sprouts are located mainly in the center of the bowl above the spinach leaves and below some sliced tomatoes. They appear to be loose, light in density, and occupy a roughly circular area about 7-8 cm diameter and about 1.5-2 cm depth. Given that sprouted seeds are very light and airy but somewhat compacted here, I estimate the volume around 50-60 ml. Typical density for such sprouts would be approximately 0.15-0.20 g/ml due to water content and loose structure. This would give a weight range roughly between 7.5 grams (50 ml x 0.15) and 12 grams (60 ml x 0.20). Considering the visual fullness and presence of some thicker sprouts, I would choose a middle estimate close to 10 grams. This is consistent with the size compared to the spinach leaves and tomatoes, which helps verify the scale. Therefore, the estimated weight of the pousses de graines in this serving is about 10 grams.\",\n  \"pousses de graines\": 10\n}",

The image shows a glass container divided roughly into two halves: one half contains cooked courgette (zucchini) and onions, chopped into small pieces, appearing sautéed. The portion fills about half of the container volume on that side, with a fairly dense pile of veggies. Cooked courgettes and onions lose water but still retain moderate density, and given the visible volume and thickness of the pile, the portion looks like a medium serving. The container is about the size of a typical lunch storage box, maybe around 15x15 cm in footprint and circa 4 cm depth. Half the container volume corresponds roughly to around 150-200 ml volume for this vegetable mix. Cooking reduces weight compared to raw weight, but density is still significant. The portion of courgette and onions looks consistent with approximately 140-170 grams based on visual volume and density. Taking the midpoint, I estimate 155 grams carefully accounting for the mix and compactness.\",\n  \"courgette et oignons\": 155\n}",

The target food item is the 'galettes millet haricots noirs maïs'. Each galette looks about 1.5 cm thick and roughly 6-7 cm in diameter, compact and dense from the millet and beans. Considering the size and density and typical weight of such homemade millet bean patties, one patty usually weighs around 40-50 grams. There are five patties, but since the request is to estimate for one galette only, I focus on one portion. Based on visual volume compared to the container size (an approximate 15x15 cm container), I judge each galette to weigh in the range of 40-55 grams. Choosing a medium estimate within this range, the final estimated weight for one galette is 47 grams.\",\n  \"galettes millet haricots noirs maïs\": 47\n}",

The pasta portion covers about one third of the container and consists of rotini pasta with some tomato-based sauce, topped with a modest layer of grated Parmesan. Considering the size of the container (roughly a standard meal prep container) and the portion size, this pasta portion looks like a medium serving, neither small nor overly large. Typical cooked pasta weight in such a portion is about 140-180 grams. Given the presence of sauce and some compaction, a realistic range would be 150 to 170 grams. I estimate the weight of the pasta itself (excluding Parmesan) to be about 160 grams. This estimate aligns with the visible volume and makes sense relative to the other components, which are smaller in volume, consistent with common meal portioning in Switzerland.\",\n  \"pâtes\": 160\n}",

The salade portion looks compact but not piled high, roughly covering an area about 7-8 cm wide and 3-4 cm thick considering the slight layering. Typical leaf salads with light dressing have low density, so their weight is relatively low despite volume. Given the size relative to the risotto and common Swiss side salad portions, the salade appears to be a small side serving roughly between 30 and 50 grams. Estimating the portion as medium-small, I choose a weight around 40 grams. This fits with the visual minimal volume on the plate and the texture of leafy salad components.\",\n  \"salade\": 40\n}",

The sautéed vegetables cover a moderate portion on the right side of the plate. The volume appears to be a medium serving, with visible chunks of carrots and leeks distributed evenly. The vegetables have softened from cooking but still retain some bulk; therefore, their density is moderate. Considering the plate size and comparing the vegetables' volume to the rice and fish portions, the vegetable portion appears to be around 150-200 grams. Taking into account the slightly compressed and cooked nature of the vegetables, the final estimated weight for the sautéed vegetables is about 175 grams.\",\n  \"légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)\": 175\n}",

The plate is a standard medium size, approximately 24 cm in diameter, which provides a reference scale. Regarding density, scrambled eggs are somewhat airy but still dense compared to vegetables. The portion looks like it was made with about 2 to 3 eggs, common for a single meal. Typical cooked egg weight per egg is around 50 grams, so the weight range for this portion is about 100 to 150 grams.

Typical dry weight for a medium cooked spaghetti portion in Switzerland ranges between 80 to 120 grams; since these are cooked, the weight is higher due to water absorption, approximately 180 to 220 grams. Considering the visible quantity, the spaghetti here seems to be around 200 grams. The pesto and gruyère are present but the estimate is strictly for spaghetti.

The bread slices appear to be moderately thick and of typical size for a sandwich slice in a Swiss context, roughly the size of a hand palm. A typical slice of whole grain bread like this weighs about 40 to 50 grams depending on thickness. The slices here are not extremely thick but are also not paper-thin. Given the size and density visible, I estimate each slice to be around 45 grams, making the total weight for both slices approximately 90 grams. Since the estimation target is for 'pain bis' as a whole, I consider the pair of slices here as the portion, estimating around 90 grams total.\",\n  \"pain bis\": 90\n}",

The compote is a thick, smooth fruit puree, somewhat translucent and spread thinly in some places and thicker in others. Given its volume and density, the compote here likely weighs between 40-60 grams. Considering the covered area and common serving sizes of apple compote alongside waffles, I estimate the compote pomme to weigh about 50 grams.

It looks like a typical homemade bolognese sauce portion served on pasta. Comparing the sauce portion to the pasta and the plate size (standard dinner plate around 25 cm in diameter) helps estimate volume. A medium portion of sauce bolognese like this, spread evenly but with some thickness, likely weighs between 100 grams (if spread thin) and 140 grams (if denser and thicker).

The visible portion is quite small, roughly about 10-12 pieces of penne pasta, a few corn kernels (approximately 10), and 2-3 cherry tomato halves. Given that cooked pasta weighs approximately 1.4 grams per penne piece and taking into account the low density of vegetables like corn and tomato, the total weight of the remaining pasta salad is limited. Assuming some small remaining dressing and herbs add minor weight, I estimate a range of 30-50 grams for this leftover portion.

A typical slice of rustic seeded bread in Switzerland weighs approximately 40-50 grams, depending on thickness and density. Given these slices are not particularly thick but also not very thin, they seem to fall in the medium range. The small broken crust piece on the plate is negligible in weight and can be ignored. Therefore, estimating each slice weighs between 40 and 50 grams, the total for three slices would be 120 to 150 grams.

Parmesan, if sprinkled on top or mixed in, is not visually dominant and thus its weight is considered negligible and part of the overall risotto weight. Therefore, the estimated weight for the parmesan component alone is small. Standard servings of parmesan as garnish typically range from 5-10 grams on risotto. The visual evidence suggests a light sprinkling rather than a thick layer, closer to about 7 grams. This fits plausibly with the visible amount and common serving customs.\",\n  \"parmesan\": 7\n}",

Given the container's visible depth and the amount of grains filling their section, I estimate the weight of the cooked spelt as a medium portion.

As these seeds are small and sprinkled thinly across the mixture, their total volume is low compared to the other ingredients. Typically, a serving of chia seeds in such a mixture is around 10-15 grams. Given the visible concentration and the size of the bowl portion, the total amount of graines de chia is likely about 12-14 grams.

Pâte portions in Switzerland typically average around 120 to 160 grams cooked per serving. Considering the visible volume against the other items (red kidney beans and green beans), which are smaller in portion, and noting the pasta is not piled too high, a plausible range could be 130-160 grams.

Butter is dense and heavy relative to volume, so even a small piece weighs noticeably. Given the relative size compared to the bread slice and cheese pieces, and that butter slices served for spreading tend to be between 10 to 15 grams, this piece looks toward the lower middle of this range due to its modest thickness.
