Considering typical Swiss portion sizes for cooked pasta salads, a normal serving would weigh between 180-250 grams. Considering the visible amount and adjusting upwards by about 40% to counter typical underestimation, the plausible range would be around 230-270 grams.

Typically, portions of oil used as dressing or for flavoring range between 10 to 20 grams on a plate.

Rhubarb is fairly dense, and tarts typically have a substantial amount of filling and crust per slice. A standard whole tart usually weighs around 700-900g total, so one slice would typically weigh between 110-150g, depending on thickness and filling amount.
