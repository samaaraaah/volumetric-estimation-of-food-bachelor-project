The slices are relatively thin and triangular, with a pale greenish-white color. Based on the size of the tray and the visible volume of the kohlrabi slices, the total portion appears to be moderate. Kohlrabi is a dense vegetable, so its weight is higher relative to its volume. Considering the amount visible, I estimate the weight of the kohlrabi slices to be approximately 200 grams.\",\n\t\"colrave crue\": 200\n}",

The fresh spinach (épinards frais) is visible as the base layer of the salad, covering the bottom of the bowl. The leaves are whole and not chopped, and they appear to be loosely packed. Based on the size of the bowl and the visible volume of spinach, I estimate that there are approximately 50-70 grams of fresh spinach. Fresh spinach is lightweight and takes up significant volume, so I will estimate the weight at the lower end of this range to account for the loose packing.\",\n\t\"épinards frais\": 60\n}"
