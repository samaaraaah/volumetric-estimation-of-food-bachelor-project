There is no visible caramel sauce on top, only the creamy custard portion. The bowl appears to be a small dessert bowl, with a diameter roughly comparable to the width of the fingers holding it, suggesting a diameter of about 10-12 cm. The crème caramel has a smooth custard texture, filling the bottom of the bowl to an estimated depth of approximately 1.5 to 2 cm. Given the dimensions, the volume of the crème caramel is modest, approximately 100-130 ml. Considering the custard density is close to that of water with some thickness (about 1.03 g/ml), the weight should be slightly above the volume in grams. Therefore, estimating the weight at around 110-130 grams is reasonable. Given the relatively shallow amount present and small bowl size, I estimate the weight of the crème caramel at approximately 120 grams.\",\n  \"crème caramel\": 120\n}",

The biscuit is a dense, moist base which adds significant weight, and the cream is dense but lighter than the biscuit. The red fruits add some volume but are relatively light. Applying typical densities and portion sizes for such layered desserts, and factoring in the Swiss portion style which does not necessarily mean smaller here due to normal slice size, the total weight is estimated in a range around 140-170 grams.

Sweet potato waffles have a moderate density, more dense than a standard wheat waffle due to the sweet potato content. Estimating the full waffle weight: a typical sweet potato waffle would weigh approximately 140-160 grams. Since we have four quarters (one full waffle in total), the total waffle portion weighs approximately 150 grams.

Tomatoes are moderately dense but contain a lot of water, so their density is closer to that of water, about 0.95 g/ml. Given the pieces' volume, I estimate each chunk weighs about 15-20 grams on average. Multiplying by 7 pieces results in approximately 105 to 140 grams in total. Considering moderate variation and the fact that some smaller pieces are less dense or smaller, I settle on a medium portion weight estimate of 120 grams for the tomatoes on this plate.\",\n  \"tomates\": 120\n}",

The pasta appears to be a mix of penne and other types, cooked and coated evenly with sauce. Step 2: The portion size covers about half the diameter of a standard-sized dinner plate (approx. 24 cm diameter). The pasta is spread relatively thinly, about 1-1.5 cm thick with some pieces overlapping, indicating medium density.

Step 1: Visual identification shows 7 slices of tomato and 6 slices of mozzarella arranged in an overlapping fashion. Step 2: Dimension analysis reveals that each slice is roughly similar in thickness, approximately 0.8 cm, with tomato slices slightly thinner. The total height of the stack is about 5-6 cm, width fits within a normal plate diameter (~20-22 cm), so lengthwise the stacked slices take approximately 12-14 cm of plate length. Step 3: Considering density, fresh mozzarella is a semi-soft, dense cheese weighing about 300 g per 100 cm3, while fresh tomatoes weigh approximately 170-180 g per 100 cm3. Step 4: Estimating volume per slice, tomato slices seem about 7cm long by 4cm wide by 0.6cm thick, about 16.8 cm3 each; mozzarella slices slightly thicker at 0.8cm thickness, about 22.4 cm3 each. Multiplying by slice counts: total tomato volume about 7 * 17 = 119 cm3, total mozzarella volume about 6 * 22.4 = 134.4 cm3.

Multiplying by nine pieces results in a total between 270 and 315 grams. The tomato sauce coating adds minimal extra weight, so it is included within the meatball estimate. Conservatively, given Swiss portion sizes and the visible volume, I estimate the total weight of the vegetable meatballs in tomato sauce to be about 290 grams.\",\n  \"boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate\": 290\n}",

The container is a typical small metal meal box, about the size of a lunchbox compartment, giving reference to the polenta's size which seems approximately 10 cm in length, about 6-7 cm in width, and about 3-4 cm in height. The volume is thus significant but not huge. Polenta is dense but lighter than pure meat, and the added cheese increases the total weight slightly, but since cheese is counted outside the polenta itself, we exclude that. Considering typical polenta density of approximately 0.9 to 1.0 g/cm3, and the estimated volume of roughly 200 to 250 cm3, the weight of this portion of polenta is estimated between 180 and 230 grams.

Standard medium-sized slices of bread in Switzerland weigh roughly 35 to 40 grams each depending on density. Here, the bread looks homemade or artisan style with some density but also airy holes, so I consider a moderate weight.

Hence, I estimate the weight to be around 15-18 grams. Choosing a midpoint estimate of 17 grams reflects a reasonable portion of chocolate spread seen on a single waffle piece in Swiss portion context.\",\n  \"pâte à tartiner au chocolat\": 17\n}",

Step 2: Dimension analysis shows the mozzarella dollop to be approximately 5-6cm long, about 3cm wide at its widest, and the visible thickness is about 1.5 to 2cm, given the slight height over the pasta. Step 3: Mozzarella cheese is relatively dense and moist, with typical density around 1 g/cm3. Given the volume roughly estimated as an irregular oval shape, volume ~ 5cm x 3cm x 1.7cm = about 25 cubic centimeters. Step 4: Considering density close to 1 g/cm3 and the moisture content, weight should roughly correspond to volume in grams, so around 25 grams. Step 5: Calibration for portion size - the portion is modest, suitable for one person topping pasta. Cross-checking with typical serving sizes of fresh mozzarella dollops, a common portion is 20-30 grams. There are no signs of excess or mixture that would increase weight.

One slice is smaller than the other three, which are medium-sized and form most of the pizza portion on the plate. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The plate is a standard small to medium plate, which suggests the pizza slices are fairly small, typical of Swiss portion sizes but not small enough to discount normal weight. The dough crust appears thin but puffy around edges with baked char marks. The toppings are spread evenly with some volume visible mainly from mushrooms and courgette slices, which add slight bulk. The cheese layer is moderate. Step 3: Density Considerations - The pizza crust is light but the cooked vegetables and cheese add density. Mushrooms and olives are dense toppings but not heavy in large quantity here, and courgettes are low density but take some volume. Overall, it’s a medium-density pizza slice.
