It consists of spiral pasta with visible pieces of vegetables like corn, cucumber, and tomato mixed in. The portion of pasta salad covers a moderate area on the plate and is about 2-3 cm thick. Considering that cooked pasta is dense and the visible portion roughly corresponds to a handful or small serving, a typical cooked pasta density of about 1.3 g/ml is plausible. The visible quantity likely ranges between 90 and 130 grams. Choosing a midpoint value while accounting for some vegetable volume that reduces pasta weight slightly, I estimate the weight of the salade de pâtes to be approximately 110 grams.\",\n  \"salade de pâtes\": 110\n}",

The tart slice has a pastry crust base which is visible as thin and flaky, a creamy filling, and several strawberry halves along with some red currants. The strawberries appear fresh and medium-sized; typical weight for the visible strawberries on the slice is around 70-90 grams since they cover the surface densely. The cream filling and crust combined likely add another 40-60 grams given the thickness and density visible. Putting this together, a reasonable weight range is approximately 110 to 150 grams. Choosing a midpoint estimate and considering visual density, I estimate the weight of this tart slice to be about 130 grams.\",\n  \"tarte aux fraises\": 130\n}",

There is no visible oil pool or distinct oily shine on the food surfaces. Since linseed oil is typically served in small amounts as a drizzle or dressing, and no container or bottle is visible, it is most likely that only a small quantity is present, absorbed or mixed with the other ingredients. Given the surrounding foods and typical portion sizes for linseed oil as a dressing, the amount is plausibly between 5–10 grams. Choosing a midpoint to reflect a moderate amount added in a meal, I estimate approximately 7 grams of linseed oil on this plate.\",\n  \"huile de lin\": 7\n}",

The slice appears to be roughly triangular, about 12 cm at its longest edge and approximately 6-7 cm wide at the thickest part. The tart has a relatively thin pastry base and a layer of rhubarb pieces embedded in a custard-like filling. Rhubarb has a moderate density and the filling adds some weight but is not very thick. Typical rhubarb tart slices weigh between 100 to 150 grams depending on thickness. Given the visible size and thickness of this slice, I estimate a plausible weight range of about 110 to 140 grams. Choosing near the middle, the estimated weight is 125 grams.

Each slice is thin, and the total volume is moderate compared to the other ingredients. Considering the typical density and moisture content of cooked or sautéed bell pepper, the weight range can be estimated. The total visible amount looks to be roughly the equivalent of half a medium bell pepper, which usually weighs around 100-150 g when raw. Since it appears cooked and thus slightly reduced in water content but still fairly dense, a weight estimate range of 70-110 grams is plausible. Taking the midpoint, a reasonable estimate is about 90 grams.\",\n  \"poivron\": 90\n}",

The tomatoes are cut into wedges and slices that cover the plate surface generously but not piled high. Each tomato wedge appears medium-sized, typical of a medium tomato weighing about 150-170 grams whole. Visually, this looks like approximately 1.5 medium tomatoes worth of tomato slices, given how the plate is mostly covered but not stacked. This suggests a plausible weight range of about 200-270 grams.

The sprouts look like a small mound, loosely packed over fresh spinach leaves. Based on the size of the bowl (standard medium salad bowl) and comparing the sprouts to the nearby cherry tomatoes (about 2-3 cm in length) and the fallafels (approximately 3-4 cm diameter), the quantity of sprouts seems to be around 40-60 grams. Sprouts are very low density and fluffy, so the visual volume corresponds to a relatively small weight. A range of about 35-65 grams seems plausible. Choosing a midpoint estimate gives around 50 grams. This is consistent with a modest portion of sprouts placed atop a salad as seen here.\",\n  \"pousses de graines\": 50\n}",

These yogurt containers typically hold around 125 grams of yogurt. The yogurt appears to be full up to the brim with a smooth, creamy texture, indicating no significant missing portion. Therefore, estimating the weight based on the container size and the visible fill level, a plausible weight range is 120-130 grams.

The courgette and onions occupy roughly half of a standard rectangular glass container, alongside five millet, black bean, and corn patties. Visually, the courgette pieces are sliced into small chunks mixed with onion, lightly cooked. Given the container appears to be about 15 cm x 15 cm, and the courgette-onion mixture fills roughly half its volume at a shallow depth (~3-4 cm), the volume is approximately 180-250 ml. Considering the low density of cooked courgette and onions, which have a density slightly less than water due to water loss but presence of fibrous content, I estimate a density around 0.8-1 g/ml. Thus, the weight range is approximately 140-210 grams. Choosing a midpoint, the estimate is 175 grams.

Each patty is roughly 6-7 cm long and about 2 cm thick, with a dense texture. Given their composition (grains and legumes), their density is moderate to high. A typical millet bean patty of this size would weigh between 30 and 40 grams each. Estimating a range of 30-40 grams per patty, and with six patties visible, the total weight range is approximately 180 to 240 grams. Choosing a value near the midpoint, I estimate the total weight of the galettes to be about 210 grams.

The pasta portion fills roughly half of the container's length and about the full width, with a depth appearing to be around 2 to 3 cm given the container's overall size and the visible volume beneath the parmesan. Using the visible container size (comparable to a standard lunchbox tray, approximately 20 cm by 12 cm), the pasta occupies about half the tray area, roughly 120 cm², and with a 2.5 cm depth this corresponds to approximately 300 ml volume. Cooked pasta has a density close to 0.9 g/ml, so the weight range is roughly 250 to 350 grams. Given the visible portion and slight space between pasta pieces, I estimate the pasta weight at about 300 grams. The range of 250-350 grams helps factor in some uncertainty in depth and density from sauce absorption.\",\n  \"pâtes\": 300\n}",

On the plate, the 'salade' is a small portion of green leafy salad mixed with some visible dressing and small pieces of other vegetables. The salad portion appears to be about the size of a small handful, approximately 6-7 cm in length and 4-5 cm in width, with a thin layer and some overlapping leaves. Considering the density of lettuce and similar salad ingredients, which are mostly water and light, the weight is likely low. A typical handful of fresh salad weighs around 20-40 grams. The visible amount here seems closer to the lower middle part of this range. Therefore, a plausible weight range would be 25-35 grams, with a midpoint estimate around 30 grams.

The sautéed vegetables form an uneven pile roughly 8 cm by 6 cm in area and about 1.5–2 cm in average height, taking into account some flattening. The volume is approximately 72 cm³ (8x6x1.5). Sautéed vegetables like these are relatively low density, roughly 0.5–0.7 g/cm³ considering water content and cooking method. This gives a weight range roughly between 36 g (0.5x72) and 50 g (0.7x72). Given the visible portion and judging the compactness of the vegetables, a sensible estimate for the weight is near the midpoint at about 43 grams. This estimate fits well with a moderate sautéed vegetable side portion and visually matches the amount on this plate.\",\n  \"légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)\": 43\n}",

Using the gnocchi and cauliflower florets as size references, the scrambled eggs pile is roughly about 10 cm by 6 cm in area and about 2–3 cm thick. This corresponds to a volume of approximately 120–180 ml. Considering the density of scrambled eggs is about 0.8 g/ml, the weight is likely between 95 and 145 grams.

Each slice looks to be around 1.2 cm thick. Based on these dimensions, one slice likely weighs between 50-60 grams. Since the estimation is for 'pain bis' which likely refers to one slice only, and considering slight variations in bread density and moisture, a reasonable weight range is 50-60 grams.

Considering its visible volume and the usual density of waffles, which is moderately dense due to the batter composition, a typical portion size for this thickness and dimension ranges between 75 and 100 grams. Given the clear visible size and standard waffle density, an estimate near the midpoint is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the waffle to be about 85 grams.\",\n  \"gaufre\": 85\n}",

Given that cooked bolognese sauce has a density close to 1 g/ml and considering the volume visually (roughly 90-120 ml), the sauce's weight would likely lie between 85 and 125 grams. Considering the visual cues and typical serving sizes in Swiss meals, a reasonable estimate is near the midpoint, about 105 grams.

Cooked asparagus spears usually weigh around 15-20 grams each. Given this, the total weight range would be approximately 7 x 15 = 105 grams to 7 x 20 = 140 grams. Considering some variability in thickness and moisture loss during cooking, I estimate the weight near the midpoint of this range. Therefore, the weight of the asparagus is about 122 grams.

Given the light and airy texture of bean chips, they tend to weigh less than typical corn chips, around 0.5-0.7 grams per chip on average. Visually estimating, the pile contains around 20 to 30 chips of varying sizes. Assuming an average chip weight of about 0.6 grams, the total weight range plausibly lies between 12 grams (20 chips) and 21 grams (35 chips). Considering the pile size and thickness, a midpoint estimate near 16 grams is reasonable. This aligns with typical snack portion sizes for such light chips.

Considering the porous texture of bread and the size of each slice, a typical slice of this kind weighs approximately between 45 and 65 grams. The two slices look similar in size and thickness, confirming this range is reasonable. Since 'pain' refers to bread here, and the question is about one slice, I estimate one slice weighs about 55 grams, near the midpoint of the range.
