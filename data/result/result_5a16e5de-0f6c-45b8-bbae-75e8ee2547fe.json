Visually, this salad occupies roughly a quarter of a standard dinner plate (about 26 cm diameter). The pasta salad is composed of spiral pasta pieces mixed with small vegetable pieces (tomato, corn, green pepper). The pasta pieces are cooked and relatively dense. The portion piled is moderate and not heaped significantly, approximating a small serving size typical in home-cooked meals. By comparing the pasta size with the carrot salad and the duck meat portion, the amount looks consistent with a typical pasta salad portion between 100 and 150 grams. Given the density and volume, 130 grams is a reasonable estimate. This cross-check aligns with portions served in Swiss settings and dietary references. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'salade de pâtes' is 130 grams.\",\n  \"salade de pâtes\": 130\n}",

The image shows a partially eaten slice of tarte aux fraises (strawberry tart) on a standard dessert plate, about 22-24 cm in diameter. The slice roughly represents about one-eighth of a typical round tart, which in Switzerland weighs around 300-400 grams total for a strawberry tart of standard size (20-24 cm diameter tart). Considering the thickness of the tart with crust, cream filling, and visible strawberries on top, the slice appears to be standard size and full. The cream and strawberries are dense but not heavy like meat; strawberries weigh about 15-25 grams each. Approximately 7-8 medium strawberries are visible on this slice, plus the creamy filling and crust. The crust and cream combined for a slice of this thickness typically weigh about 30-40 grams. Adding strawberry weight (about 7 strawberries × 20 grams average = 140 grams) plus 35 grams for crust and cream results in about 175 grams. This estimate aligns with typical Swiss tart slice weights and portion sizes. Therefore, the estimated weight for this slice of tarte aux fraises is about 175 grams.\",\n  \"tarte aux fraises\": 175\n}",

In the image, there is no visible bottle or container of oil directly present, so the linseed oil must be considered as a drizzle or small amount used to dress the other items on the plate. Typically, such oil usage is small, especially for linseed oil which is used sparingly. A light coating or drizzle on the food would be roughly in the range of 5 to 10 grams. Considering the overall plate size, the shine on the cooked courgette and other components may hint at a thin layer of oil. Estimating conservatively, the amount of linseed oil on this plate is likely around 7 grams. This is consistent with common dietary practices and the visual evidence given the plate size and food volume.\",\n  \"huile de lin\": 7\n}",

Visually, the slice appears to be about one-eighth of a whole tart, given its triangular shape and the typical portion size for tarts. The tart slice is on a standard-sized plate (approximately 26 cm diameter) with a fork and knife next to it, which helps confirm scale. A whole Swiss rhubarb tart typically weighs around 350-450 grams, considering both the pastry and the rhubarb filling. The rhubarb pieces on top are cut into chunks that add some weight but are not excessively thick, and the tart is not overly thick either. Given it’s about one-eighth of a whole tart, the weight should be roughly 350-450 grams divided by 8, which results in approximately 44-56 grams. Taking the middle value of this range, about 50 grams is a good estimate. This aligns well with the visible size and typical Swiss tart portion weights.\",\n  \"tarte à la rhubarbe\": 50\n}",

Visually, the poivron is sliced and arranged in strips on a plate. We can see about 6-7 strips, each approximately 4-6 cm long and 1-1.5 cm wide, and relatively thin. Bell peppers are hollow and low in density, but these appear to be cooked or sautéed, making them slightly more compact. Typically, a medium Swiss bell pepper weighs around 150-180 g when whole. The visible amount here appears to be around half or maybe slightly less than half of a whole bell pepper, given the size relative to other items like the chicken pieces and the wrap. Therefore, halving 150-180 g gives around 75-90 g. Since slices are thin and not a full 50%, I estimate closer to 70 g for this portion. This estimation falls within typical ranges and matches the visual volume relative to the plate and adjacent foods.\",\n  \"poivron\": 70\n}",

From the image, the muesli is in a small orange bowl, which looks like a typical small serving dish with a diameter of around 9-10 cm. The muesli consists of large clusters rather than loose flakes, almost filling the bowl to the top with some air gaps between clusters. A typical serving of cluster-style muesli weighs more per volume than loose flakes but less than dense foods. Each cluster is quite large; this appears equivalent to about a standard single serving portion. Given the bowl's size and the clearly visible filling, the amount of muesli likely aligns with around 40 to 50 grams. Considering the clusters density and volume, a reasonable estimate is about 45 grams of muesli. This is consistent with typical Swiss portion sizes and the bowl's fill level.\",\n  \"muesli nature\": 45\n}",

From the image, the tomatoes are cut into medium-sized wedges, placed on a plate of about 22-24 cm in diameter, a common dinner plate size. They cover most of the plate's surface but are arranged in a single layer without significant piling. Each wedge is about 2-3 cm thick, and the tomato appears fresh and firm. There are approximately 14-16 tomato wedges visible on the plate. A medium Swiss tomato typically weighs around 150-180 g and can be cut into 6-8 wedge slices. Given this, the total amount of tomatoes present corresponds roughly to about 2 medium tomatoes. Using 160 g as an average weight per tomato, 2 tomatoes would weigh about 320 g. To be conservative and considering some variation in size and cut, I estimate about 300 g of tomato wedges in this salad. The oil, vinegar, and flax seeds contribute negligibly to the tomato weight and are not included as per instructions.\",\n  \"salade de tomates\": 300\n}",

The specified food item is 'maréchal,' which appears as small cubes of cheese on the plate. By observing the image, there are about five rectangular cheese cubes. Each cheese cube is roughly 1.5 cm on each side, which is a typical size for a cheese portion. Swiss cheese cubes of this size generally weigh about 10 to 12 grams each. With five pieces, the total weight would be approximately 50 to 60 grams. Considering slight variability in cube size and density and the fact they are Swiss cheese (typically dense), an estimate near the middle of this range is reasonable. There is no container or packaging for the cheese, so all visible cubes are counted and estimated. The plate diameter (~26 cm) helps confirm scale and cube size. The estimate is consistent with standard portion sizes and plausible Swiss cheese cube weights.\",\n  \"maréchal\": 55\n}",

The specified food is 'pousses de graines,' which are visible in the salad bowl as white and light green sprouted seeds. The bowl size is roughly standard, about 20 cm across, and the sprouts are spread over the bottom center portion of the plate underneath and between the spinach leaves and cherry tomatoes. They sit loose, without a container, approximately covering an area of about 10 cm by 8 cm with a visible depth of roughly 1.5 to 2 cm. Sprouts are light but relatively dense due to the volume of sprouted seeds, so density is moderate. Estimating the visible volume as a flattened bunch: 10 cm × 8 cm × 1.5 cm = 120 cm³ volume approximation. Sprouts have a loose density close to 0.25 g/cm³ (considering air space). Multiplying: 120 × 0.25 = 30 g approximately. This matches visual bulk and typical portion sizes for sprouts on a salad. This fits plausible portions for sprouts on a salad plate and is consistent with the visible amount relative to other ingredients.\",\n  \"pousses de graines\": 30\n}",

From the image, the yogurt is in a standard single-serving plastic container, which is typical in Switzerland and Europe. These individual yogurt cups usually contain around 125 grams net weight. The cup appears nearly full, confirming it hasn't been partially consumed or emptied. Considering the size comparison with the apple next to it, the container size matches the standard small yogurt cup, not the larger multipack containers. Therefore, the best estimate for the weight of the 'yaourt nature' is 125 grams.\",\n  \"yaourt nature\": 125\n}",

The specified food is 'courgette et oignons', located on the left side of the container. The container is a square glass box roughly 14 cm by 14 cm. The courgette and onions fill about half of the container's volume, roughly 7 cm by 7 cm in area. The height of the food is about 3-4 cm, judging by the depth visible and the inside angles of the glass container. Cooked courgette and onions are low density and contain some water, so weight will be moderate for volume. Volume estimate: 7 cm x 7 cm x 3.5 cm = 171.5 cm³. Cooked courgette and onions typically weigh close to water density (~1 g/cm³) but slightly less dense due to air spaces and cooking water evaporation, about 0.9 g/cm³. Multiplying volume by density: 171.5 × 0.9 ≈ 154 g. This is a plausible portion size and consistent with visible quantity and container size. Other food items present (millet black bean corn patties) aid scale estimation but do not interfere with the estimate. No container weight included, only food. Therefore, an estimated weight of approximately 150 grams for the courgette et oignons is justified and consistent with visual evidence and plausible portion sizes in Switzerland.\",\n  \"courgette et oignons\": 150\n}",

In the image, these are the small patties on the right side of the glass container. They contain visible black beans (haricots noirs) and corn kernels (maïs) embedded in a millet-based mix. There are five galettes arranged vertically. Each galette appears to be roughly 7-8 cm in length, 4-5 cm in width, and about 1-1.5 cm thick. Given their dense ingredients (millet, beans, corn) and compact shape, they have a significant density similar to cooked grain and legume patties. Typically, such millet-based galettes weigh around 40-50 grams each based on volume and density approximations. Five galettes thus collectively weigh approximately 200-250 grams. Considering some minor spacing and slight irregularities in shape, a realistic estimate for the total weight of these five galettes is around 220 grams.\",\n  \"galettes millet haricots noirs maïs\": 220\n}",
    "12": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'pâtes' (pasta). The image shows a rectangular metal container with three clearly separated portions: grilled chicken on the left, green beans in the middle, and pasta topped with grated Parmesan on the right. The pasta portion occupies roughly one-third of the container. The container appears to be a standard meal prep tray, approximately 20 cm by 13 cm in visible food area, and the pasta lies flat with some slight thickness—approximately 2-3 cm depth visible. The pasta is rotini type and coated with sauce and cheese. Considering the volume (20 cm × 7 cm × 2.5 cm ~ 350 cm³) and knowing cooked pasta density is about 0.9 g/cm³, the pasta weight is roughly 350 × 0.9 = 315 grams. However, because there is some space between pieces and sauce, a slight reduction is realistic, so estimate about 280-300 grams. Given typical Swiss ready meal portion sizes and comparison to the size of the chicken and green beans portions, a well-grounded estimate for the weight of the pasta in this container is around 290 grams.\",\n  \"pâtes\": 290\n}",

The salad is a small cluster about 6-7 cm long and 4-5 cm wide, and it seems to be about 0.5-1 cm thick. The leaves are light and airy, so their density is quite low compared to dense foods. Given the plate diameter (typically ~26 cm) and comparing the salad portion size relative to the risotto serving (a more dense and heavier food), the salad portion seems to weigh roughly between 20 to 40 grams. Factoring in the small amount of dressing and vegetable pieces adding slightly to the weight, a reasonable estimate is around 30 grams for this small mixed green salad.\",\n  \"salade\": 30\n}",

Visually, the sautéed vegetables occupy about one-third of the plate, next to rice and fish. Given the plate size (approximately 24–26 cm diameter) and the volume and density of cooked carrots and leeks, the portion looks like a moderate serving: neither heaped nor minimal, with visible pieces of carrots and leeks. Cooked carrots and leeks have densities around 0.7-0.9 g/ml, and considering the volume visible (around 150-180 ml estimate) the weight would be around 125-160 grams. The portion appears neither overly compact nor excessive. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the sautéed vegetables portion weight is about 140 grams.\",\n  \"légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)\": 140\n}",

The scrambled eggs appear in the upper left portion of the plate. The plate diameter is roughly 26 cm, which helps scale the servings. The scrambled eggs cover a reasonable area corresponding to approximately 2 to 3 medium eggs worth of cooked product. A medium egg yolk and white cooked weight is around 50 grams. Scrambled eggs typically retain close to that weight after cooking, minus slight moisture loss. Given the volume and density of the scrambled eggs portion visible here, it appears to be roughly equivalent to 2 medium eggs worth, possibly slightly more but less than 3 eggs. That leads to a weight estimate around 100 to 130 grams. Since it is not extremely fluffy or piled high, I lean toward the midpoint. Also considering the proportion on the plate relative to gnocchi and cauliflower parts, 120 grams is a balanced and plausible estimate. This fits well within typical Swiss portion sizes for scrambled eggs, not too little or excessive. Therefore, the estimated weight of the scrambled eggs is 120 grams.\",\n  \"oeufs brouillés\": 120\n}",

Considering the visible volume (a moderately heaped plate) and comparing the spaghetti size to the plate and surrounding objects (like the lighter or the pen, which give a good sense of scale), the portion seems to be on the smaller to medium side, likely about 140-160 grams. Since the pesto and cheese are on top but not heavily mixed or covering all spaghetti, the pasta weight is clear. Also, given the plate's diameter and the spaghetti mound height, 150 grams is a plausible and defensible estimate for cooked spaghetti in a Swiss context.\",\n  \"spaghetti\": 150\n}",

The bread appears to be standard sliced pain bis, likely from a typical Swiss loaf. A standard slice of Swiss pain bis weighs approximately 40-50 grams. Given the thickness and size relative to the hand in the photo, each slice is about average size. Since there are two slices, the combined bread weight would be roughly 80-100 grams. However, since the instruction is to estimate the weight of pain bis (the bread), and it appears two slices are shown, I will assume the entire bread portion is being considered, i.e., both slices combined. Therefore, estimating 45 grams per slice and two slices, the total is about 90 grams.

Visually, the sauce covers roughly a third of the plate surface area where the pasta is arranged. The plate diameter is standard (about 26 cm). Assuming the pasta portion is moderately sized, the sauce depth appears thin but spread evenly enough to indicate a typical serving. A typical portion of bolognese sauce accompanying a plate of pasta in Switzerland usually ranges between 100-150 g. Given that the plate is not heaped with sauce but is a solid visible layer under the cheese, I estimate it closer to the lower-middle end of this range. The pasta serves as a reference for volume, and the sauce does not overflow or pool heavily around it, indicating it is not an excessive amount.

The tiramisu slice appears to be around 10 cm long, about 4-5 cm wide, and roughly 4 cm thick. Tiramisu is a creamy layered dessert, so it has moderate density but contains light cream components, soaked sponge, and mascarpone cheese. A typical Swiss portion of tiramisu slice weighs approximately 120-150 grams. Given that this is a reasonably generous slice but not huge, and considering possible moisture and cream partially settled outside the slice, 130 grams is an estimated weight.

Penne pasta is dense once cooked, and cooked penne weighs approximately 20-25 grams per 10 pieces. Considering the scattered distribution and modest volume without a full heaping pile, and accounting for the vegetables which add some bulk but not much weight, I estimate this portion to weigh around 40 grams.

The chips fill a good portion of the plate but are not heaped very high, mostly lying flat or slightly overlapping. The individual chips seem to be triangular and thin, roughly 5-7 cm per side. Based on the coverage and density, this looks like a light to medium portion. Bean chips are lighter than potato chips due to their airiness but still somewhat dense. Typical commercial retail bags of similar chips weigh around 150g to 200g. A small handful or a single plate serving would plausibly be around 30 to 50g.

Therefore, the combined weight of the two fried eggs should be roughly twice the typical weight of a single cooked egg. Using an average egg weight of 55 grams each, the total weight for two eggs is about 110 grams.

Given the piece's size and thickness, this portion is a fraction of a standard pizza slice, appearing to be about one half or less of a typical 1/8th slice size. A whole 1/8th slice weighs approximately 60-70 g. Since this piece is roughly half of a full slice or slightly less, an estimate of around 30-35 g is reasonable.

The volume occupied is roughly a rectangular prism around 7 cm by 6 cm by 2 cm of depth that is visibly filled. That gives a volume of about 84 cm3. Cooked spelt has a density close to boiled grains, approximately 1.3 g/cm3. So 84 cm3 × 1.3 g/cm3 = approximately 110 grams. This is consistent with a moderate portion of cooked spelt grains served as a side dish in Switzerland. Cross-checking portion sizes for cooked whole grains usually range from 100-150 grams per serving, and this visual amount aligns well with smaller servings.

Typically, chia seeds are quite small and dense. The quantity of chia seeds visible corresponds roughly to about 1 to 2 teaspoons of dry seeds. Considering a teaspoon (~5 ml) of chia seeds weighs about 5 to 7 grams, the visible chia seed quantity is approximately one full teaspoon or slightly more but less than two.

Comparing to typical Swiss portion sizes and salads, a salad portion of this size with mixed ingredients usually weighs around 150-170 grams. Considering these factors and visual scale versus plate and egg sizes, the best weight estimate for the salad is approximately 160 grams.\",\n  \"salade (salade verte, carottes, avocat, 1cs huile d'olive, 1 cs vinaigre)\": 160\n}",

The food item is 'colrave crue' (raw kohlrabi), which is shown in peeled and sliced form on a small rectangular white tray. The tray appears to be a standard size similar to small disposable trays (approximately 15-18 cm in length). The slices of raw kohlrabi are chunky and firm, with thickness around 1-1.5 cm. From the image, about 15-20 pieces are visible, each roughly 3-5 cm in length and 2-4 cm in width. Considering the density of raw kohlrabi (about 0.7 g/cm³), and estimating the total volume occupied by the pieces on the tray, the total weight seems to be in the range of a small to medium serving. The overall pile is about 2-3 cm thick in most parts. Given the visual estimate and typical portion sizes for raw kohlrabi slices, the weight is roughly between 180 and 220 grams. After cross-checking for plausibility against portion sizes and volume, I conclude approximately 200 grams is a reasonable estimate.\",\n  \"colrave crue\": 200\n}",
    "99": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'épinards frais' (fresh spinach). Visually, the épinards frais are fresh spinach leaves forming the base in the bowl. The bowl appears to be a standard-sized salad bowl, approximately 20 cm wide. The spinach leaves are spread out but not densely packed, filling the bottom and some of the sides, with the falafels and other ingredients on top. Fresh spinach leaves, being leafy and not very dense, weigh relatively little compared to the volume they occupy. Considering the visible volume of the spinach distributed across the plate, I estimate it to be about a handful to one medium portion. Typically, a portion of fresh spinach leaves used in salads weighs between 30 and 50 grams. Since the leaves appear medium in quantity (not heaped but well covering the plate surface partially), a reasonable estimate here is about 40 grams. This aligns well with typical serving sizes and the visual portion in front of us, without overestimating the thickness or density of the spinach leaves.\",\n  \"épinards frais\": 40\n}"
