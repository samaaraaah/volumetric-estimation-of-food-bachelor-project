The image shows a translucent blue bowl held by a hand, with a creamy light yellow substance spread inside the bottom of the bowl. This is identified as crème caramel, appearing partially filling the shallow bottom of the bowl. The bowl's diameter can be visually approximated by comparing it to the size of the fingers holding it, assuming an adult hand with fingers about 1.5-2 cm wide. The crème caramel layer looks uneven but roughly occupies a circle about 8-10 cm in diameter and an estimated average thickness of about 1.5-2 cm, slightly heaped in the center. The volume corresponds to a pudding-like creamy texture with medium density, so its weight is roughly equivalent to its volume in milliliters (assuming slightly denser than water). Estimating volume: circle area (π * r^2) with r ~4 cm is 50 cm^2 multiplied by 1.5 cm depth = ~75 cm^3 or grams. Given the density slightly above water due to cream and sugar, I raise this to about 85 grams total. Therefore, the estimated weight of the crème caramel in the bowl is around 85 grams.\",\n  \"crème caramel\": 85\n}",

The image shows a square piece of délice des dieux on a plate, topped with fresh red fruits - specifically two raspberries and two blueberries. The dessert has three visible layers: a pinkish biscuit base soaked with juice, a thick creamy white mascarpone and séré layer on top, and fresh fruits placed on top. The piece measures approximately 8 cm by 8 cm in surface area, inferred by comparing to the plate diameter which seems to be around 20 cm. The dessert has a visible cream thickness of about 1.5 cm and the biscuit base appears about 1 cm thick, giving an overall approximate thickness of 2.5 cm. The cream layer is dense but aerated mascarpone+séré, and the biscuit is moderately dense and moist soaked with fruit juice, while the fresh fruits add some weight but are light individually. Given that the whole portion is a single square piece and that similar layered desserts typically weigh between 100-150g for similar size, and accounting for the density of cream combined with the spongy biscuit base and fresh fruit, the approximate weight should be closer to around 130 grams.

Each quarter is approximately a rectangular shape about 7 cm long, 5 cm wide, and roughly 1.5 cm thick, based on comparing to the visible plate size and texture. The waffles appear cooked with a dense, slightly moist interior typical of sweet potato batter. There is a layer of white sauce and a slice of smoked salmon on top but these are not included in this estimation since the target is only the sweet potato waffle. The waffles have a grid texture typical of waffles, which suggests some air pockets but mostly dense structure. Considering density slightly less than dense bread but more than airy waffle due to sweet potato flour and moisture, an estimated density is about 0.5-0.6 g/cm³. Each quarter would therefore weigh approximately 7 * 5 * 1.5 = 52.5 cm³ volume, multiplied by 0.55 g/cm³ density gives ~29 grams per quarter. Four quarters total about 116 grams. Given some conservative margin for moisture and batter thickness variation, the total weighs around 110-120 grams.

Each tomato piece is about 2-3 cm long and appears moderately thick with some juice visible, indicating freshness and density typical of ripe tomatoes. By comparing the tomato pieces to the cucumber slices and the plate diameter, the total tomato volume looks moderate, covering a small portion of the plate. Tomatoes have a density close to water, so volume equates closely to weight. Each tomato piece likely weighs about 15 grams on average. Multiplying by 8 pieces gives an estimated total weight around 120 grams.

The chili covers approximately one-third of the plate's surface area. The cervelas pieces are cut into roughly uniform cubes about 2-3 cm each, with visible kidney beans interspersed in a thick sauce. The depth of the chili portion appears to be about 1.5 to 2 cm, considering the height relative to the pasta on the same plate. The plate is a standard dinner plate size (approx. 25 cm diameter) which helps gauge volume. Given the density of the chili (meat, beans, and thick sauce), it is relatively heavy per volume. Estimating the chili volume to be around 200-250 ml or grams in weight equivalents, while accounting for the density of cooked beans and meat, the weight should fall near 230 grams. There is no visible hidden layer underneath, so no additional volume is added. Therefore, based purely on visual evidence and density considerations, the estimated weight of the chili is approximately 230 grams.\",\n  \"chili\": 230\n}",

The food occupies approximately half of the container's base area and is roughly 2 to 3 cm deep. In dimension comparison, the container appears to be a small to medium sized glass lunch box, approximately 15 cm by 15 cm, indicated by the width of the food relative to the container and visible edges. The courgette and onions are cooked, so they have a wet, slightly reduced volume compared to raw. Density-wise, courgette is fairly water-rich and light but onions add moderate density; combined, this is a moderately dense cooked vegetable mix. Considering the approximate volume (about half of a 15x15x3 cm space = ~338 cm3) and average cooked vegetable density (~0.8 g/cm3), the estimated weight is roughly 270 grams.

Comparing their size relative to the fingers, each cashew is approximately 2.5 to 3 cm long and seems fairly dense. The average weight of a single cashew nut is about 1.3 to 1.5 grams. Multiplying 18 cashews by an average weight of 1.4 grams results in about 25 grams. Considering some slight variation in size and density, the total weight is likely between 22 and 28 grams.

The mashed potatoes portion is visible as roughly a scoop about 9 cm long, 7 cm wide, and about 2 cm thick, judging by comparison to the plate diameter (standard dinner plate around 25 cm). The purée has a smooth and dense appearance but is soft and aerated, typical for mashed potatoes. The surface is partially covered by meat and sauce but the underlying purée volume can be roughly estimated. Based on these dimensions, the volume is approximately 9 cm x 7 cm x 2 cm = 126 cm³. Mashed potatoes have a density close to 1 g/cm³, so the weight is approximately 126 grams.

The image shows a black bowl containing several food items, including porridge, raspberries (framboises), blueberries (myrtilles), dark chocolate chips, and peanut butter. The target food item to estimate is 'myrtilles', or blueberries. Focusing on the blueberries, I count approximately 11 individual blueberries visible, clustered mostly on the left side of the bowl. The blueberries vary slightly in size but appear roughly uniform overall. The blueberries have a typical round shape and the visible individual fruits seem similar in size to a standard blueberry, approximately 1.5 to 2 cm in diameter. Using the bowl as a size reference, the blueberries cover an area roughly 6 to 8 cm in diameter if laid side by side, and a single layer is visible with little overlap, indicating no hidden depth beneath. As blueberries are dense and solid fruit, their density is relatively high, about 0.7 to 0.9 g/cm3. Each blueberry typically weighs around 1.5 to 2 grams. With about 11 blueberries seen, the total is approximately 16 to 22 grams.

The plate has a diameter likely around 20 cm (standard dessert plate), and the tiramisu occupies about one-third of the plate's surface lengthwise, approximately 7-8 cm long, 3-4 cm wide. The height of the tiramisu is about 4-5 cm based on the cream layering visible on the side. The texture appears creamy with soaked cake, so the density can be considered medium due to cream and moist cake. Given typical tiramisu densities and the measured dimensions, I estimate the tiramisu weight to be between 120 and 140 grams.

The banana piece is approximately 10 cm long based on the typical texture and shape of the banana. It appears to be about 3.5 cm in diameter in the middle section. The banana is not sliced further; it is a whole segment of the banana without the peel. The density of banana is relatively high for a fruit, as it is dense and moist inside. Given the length, diameter, and typical density, the weight is estimated as a typical small-to-medium banana segment, roughly a third of a whole banana. Whole bananas generally weigh around 120-150 grams including peel; peeled banana weight is typically about 80% of that. Considering this piece is roughly one third of a standard banana, the estimated weight is around 50 grams.\",\n  \"banane\": 50\n}",

The image shows a white plate with a serving of pâtes carbonara topped with shredded gruyère cheese. The pasta portion is a mix of penne and some shell pasta, coated with a creamy sauce and small pieces of meat (presumably bacon or pancetta). The pasta pile covers a roughly circular area of about 12-14 cm diameter on the plate. The depth of the pasta mound, judging by visible edges and the piled cheese, appears to be around 2-3 cm thick. The amount of shredded gruyère on top is a small mound covering the center, approximately 3-4 cm in diameter and about 0.5-1 cm thick. The density of cooked pasta with sauce and meat is relatively high, estimated around 1.2 g/cm3 due to moisture and fat content, while shredded cheese is lighter but compact. Considering visual volume, the pasta portion likely weighs about 130-160 grams, and the shredded cheese on top approximately 10-15 grams. Since the target food is pâtes carbonara (including the creamy pasta and bits of meat but excluding the cheese itself which is a separate item), the estimation focuses solely on the pasta with sauce and meat. Therefore, subtracting the cheese weight, the pâtes carbonara portion weighs around 140 grams.\",\n  \"pâtes carbonara\": 140\n}",

The wrap is thin and approximately the size of a standard large tortilla, visually close to the diameter of the plate, estimated around 22-24 cm. The thickness of the wrap is minimal as it is flat, possibly around 2-3 mm. The consistency is like a whole wheat or multigrain flatbread based wrap. Typical density for such flatbread wraps is about 330-350 grams per square meter. Based on visual evidence, the diameter corresponds to a circle of ~22.5 cm radius 11.25 cm. Area = pi * r² ≈ 3.14 * (11.25)² ≈ 397.5 cm². Converting to m² = 0.03975 m². Weight estimate = 0.03975 m² * 340 g/m² (average) ≈ 13.5 grams. There are no visible thick layers or multiple wraps; this is a single wrap without added bulk. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the galette wrap itself as about 14 grams, considering slight thickness and small imperfections. This is lower than some standard wraps, but visually confirmed from the single thin wrap on the plate.\",\n  \"galette wraps\": 14\n}",

The image shows a single slice of tarte aux fraises (strawberry tart) on a patterned ceramic plate. The tart slice appears to be about one sixth of a whole tart, judging by the crust edge and the typical wedge shape. There are seven visible strawberries cut in halves and placed on top, along with some smaller red currants embedded in the creamy filling. The crust is thin and crumbly with fragments on the plate. The cream filling looks dense but aerated, occupying the space between crust and strawberries. By comparing the tart slice size to the average dessert plate diameter (around 22 cm), the slice is roughly 10 cm long and 5 cm wide at its broadest end. The slice's height is approximately 3.5 cm, considering the berries' height and the filling. The density combines the crumbly crust, creamy filling, and fresh fruit. Given strawberries are about 0.6 g/cm3 (dense for fruit) and cream plus crust raise overall slice density to roughly 0.9 g/cm3. Calculating an estimated volume: length x width x height = 10 x 5 x 3.5 = 175 cm3. Multiplying volume by estimated density: 175 x 0.9 = 157.5 g. Considering some air pockets and possible overestimation, I adjust down slightly to account for crumb loss and air in cream, resulting in a final weight estimate of approximately 150 grams for this slice.\",\n  \"tarte aux fraises\": 150\n}",

On top, there is a spread of chestnut cream (crème de marrons) and butter. The chestnut cream is applied unevenly but covers most of the surface, with butter visible underneath and slightly melted. The thickness of the spread combined (butter + chestnut cream) appears moderate, approximately 3-4 mm in depth. Toasted bread density is lighter than fresh bread but still notable, with a typical thin slice of this size weighing around 20-25 grams. The chestnut cream is dense and sticky, while the butter adds density but in a thin layer. The spread likely weighs about 15 grams combined considering the visible amount and density. Adding these together, the total weight of the tartine with spread should be in the range of 35-40 grams.

The sauce layer thickness seems thin, about 2-3 millimeters judging by the slight pooling and edges visible on the plate. The amount covers a surface area of approximately 12 cm by 7 cm over two meat slices, and there is no separate container or pile of sauce. Considering onion sauces tend to be moderately dense (mostly liquid with cooked onions), the volume would be roughly 12 cm x 7 cm x 0.2 cm = about 16.8 cm³ or milliliters.

Each slice of tomato appears roughly 1.5 cm thick, about 5 to 6 cm wide, and the mozzarella slices are similar in size but slightly thicker, about 1.7 cm thick. The tomato slices are fresh and contain water, so their density is lower than mozzarella, which is denser (soft cheese).

The plate diameter is estimated around 22-24 cm using the knife and fork nearby as size reference. The total volume of tomato pieces visible corresponds to a modest salad portion. The flax seeds sprinkled on top cover the tomato surface densely but add minimal weight; their contribution is negligible compared to the tomatoes themselves. Tomato density is high due to water content but the salad's volume and slice thickness suggest a weight roughly between 200-250 grams.

The plate diameter is approximately 25 cm, and the sauce covers about 60% of the plate's inner surface area. Considering the sauce density approximates water-based gravies at about 1 g/ml, and estimating the total volume of the sauce to be roughly equivalent to a flat cylinder 15 cm diameter and 0.2 cm thick, this volume is approximately 35 ml, which corresponds roughly to 35 grams. Given pooling sauce around edges, I add approximately 10%-15% extra, totaling about 40 grams of sauce visible on the plate. No container weight is included.

The portion is about the size of a small handful on the plate, occupying roughly 1/6th of the plate's surface area. The pasta is dense and compact, while the cornichon pieces are small and embedded in the salad. For 'cornichon', individual small slices are visible inside the pasta salad, and also possibly in the rice salad, but since only the pasta salad explicitly includes visible cornichon pieces, I focus on those. The visible cornichon pieces are small, about 0.5-1 cm each, totaling roughly 10-15 grams dispersed in the pasta salad. 'Fromage' (cheese) is not clearly visible as solid pieces on the plate; there might be small bits mixed in the salads but not clearly distinct. Given the input, I focus on visible cheese, which appears to be a minor portion, estimated visually about 10 grams since there are no distinct lumps. For 'tomate', there is one small whole cherry tomato on a skewer, visually about 15 grams, consistent with average cherry tomato weights. Summarizing quantities based on visual volume and density: 'salade de pâtes' including cornichon pieces is approximately 90 grams, cornichon component within that about 10-15 grams, tomato about 15 grams, and fromage about 10 grams. Since the question groups these foods, my best estimate for combined weight of 'salade de pâtes, cornichon, fromage, tomate' focuses on the whole unit present on the plate. The largest item is the pasta salad with embedded cornichons, cherry tomato is a separate visible item, and cheese is minor and likely blended in small quantity. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of these four combined foods as approximately 115 grams, broken down roughly as 90 grams pasta salad (including cornichon), 15 grams tomato, and 10 grams fromage.

The pasta appears cooked and slightly glossy due to sauce or oil. Comparing to the plate size, which is a standard dinner plate of approximately 26-28 cm diameter, the pasta portion occupies about one quarter of the plate's surface area. The pasta is dense and cooked, so it will be heavier than it looks due to water absorption. Given these dimensions and the spread of the pasta pile, an estimated volume corresponds to roughly 120-150 grams. Considering the presence of sauce on top with mushrooms, but excluding that as it is a separate item, the pure pasta portion is estimated conservatively at about 140 grams, allowing for some depth under the visible top layer but no hidden additional portions.

The pieces appear cooked, as indicated by the softened and slightly shriveled texture and some browning on the edges. The main pepper half, judging by comparison to the white plate and fork nearby, is about 7-8 cm in height and 6-7 cm in diameter. The two slices together represent approximately half of the flesh of a typical pepper. The pepper's wall thickness looks to average around 0.7-1 cm. Considering the pepper has been hollowed and part of it is filled with quinoa and bulgur (which is excluded from the estimate), only the weight of the pepper flesh pieces visible should be counted. Cooked bell peppers have a density around 0.9 g/cm3 and lose some moisture during cooking but retain most weight. The total visible pepper flesh (main hollowed half plus two slices) corresponds roughly to about 110-130 grams fresh weight raw based on volume, but accounting for cooking moisture loss, the visible pieces together likely weigh about 85-95 grams.

The thickness of the ketchup spread appears to be roughly 2-3 mm when compared to the height of the mayonnaise dollop and the size of the plate pattern nearby. Considering the density of ketchup, which is close to that of water (approximately 1 g/ml), the volume can be approximated by treating the ketchup as a circular disc with diameter 4.5 cm and thickness 0.25 cm, which yields a volume of about 4 cm³ (π × radius² × thickness ≈ 3.14 × 2.25² × 0.25).

Comparing the container size (likely around 15 cm wide) and gnocchi size, the total volume occupied by the gnocchi can be estimated. Gnocchi is dense but lighter than pure cheese or meat. Typically, one gnocchi weighs approximately 15-20 grams. Multiplying the approximate count (16) by 17 grams average yields about 272 grams.

Each egg has a visible yolk and white portion, with the total visible surface area roughly matching that of a typical large egg (approximately 5 cm diameter per egg). Thickness looks typical for fried eggs, about 0.5 cm, consistent with a single layer of egg white and yolk. There is no sign of extra ingredients or double layers. Based on typical food density and size for cooked eggs, each fried egg weighs approximately 50 grams. Two eggs would thus weigh around 100 grams.

Assuming the bowl is a standard medium-sized cereal bowl (about 15-18 cm diameter), the yogurt's surface area covers approximately 1/6 to 1/5 of the bottom area. The depth/height of the yogurt mound is around 2-3 cm. Yogurt has a density close to water, around 1 g/cm³, meaning the volume in cm³ closely correlates to weight in grams. Estimating the volume as roughly a circular base of about 6 cm diameter and 2.5 cm height, the volume is approximately π * (3 cm)^2 * 2.5 cm ≈ 70 cm³.

The depth of toppings including cheese, mushrooms, olives, and courgettes adds volume but is relatively thin, roughly 0.5-1 cm thickness. The slices lie relatively flat without heavy piling. Step 3: Density Considerations - The pizza base is thin crust which is moderately dense. Cheese and vegetable toppings like mushrooms, olives, and courgettes contribute additional density but are less dense than meat toppings. The olives and mushrooms add moderate weight. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - A typical thin crust pizza slice might weigh between 80 to 120 grams depending on thickness and toppings.

Visually, the peach is round and appears to be moderately sized based on the texture and typical appearance of such fruit. It looks fresh, with a smooth skin and slight variations in color. Assuming an average diameter of about 7 to 8 centimeters, which is typical for a standard peach, and considering the density of peaches which is mostly water with some fibrous material, the weight is likely near the average peach weight. There are no cuts or portions missing; the whole peach is present. Given these observations and comparing with common fruit weight data, the estimated weight is approximately 150 grams.\",\n  \"pêche\": 150\n}",

The target food item is 'chou romanesco,' which is visible in the upper right quadrant of the plate. The chou romanesco is cut into several small florets, totaling around 8 distinct pieces visible. Each floret is irregular in shape but comparable in size to the penne pasta on the plate. The florets are relatively thick and dense cruciferous vegetable segments with visible stem bases, indicating solid volume. The florets appear to be cooked but not mushy, maintaining their structural integrity and density typical of Romanesco broccoli. Comparing the size of the florets to the knife on the tray and the penne pasta pieces next to it, each floret measures approximately 4-5 cm in length and 3 cm in width, with a rough thickness of 2-3 cm, forming a modest pile. The total volume of the florets suggests a moderate portion size. Considering the density of cooked Romanesco broccoli (about 0.95 g/cm3), the total estimated weight of the chou romanesco portion on the plate is approximately 90 grams.\",\n  \"chou romanesco\": 90\n}",

The left slice has a light-colored spread with a slightly shiny, melted texture, consistent with butter ('beurre'). The right slice has an orange-yellow spread, likely jam or marmalade. Focusing only on the butter ('beurre'), it appears as a thin but uneven layer covering most of the left slice of bread. The knife on the plate suggests a typical spread thickness of about 2-3 mm. Considering the slice size is approximately the size of a small rustic bread slice (around 10cm x 6cm) and accounting for the gaps in the bread, the butter layer is likely between 10-15 grams. Butter is dense, so a thin layer even covering the slice will weigh a measurable amount.

The image shows a black plate with two triangular pieces of omelette aux tomates and one single slice of whole grain bread (pain). The bread slice is clearly visible and lies flat on the plate. Its shape and texture indicate it is a standard slice of whole grain bread, typical in home or café servings. The slice is about the size of the omelette pieces next to it, roughly round with a slight crust edge and an airy but dense crumb. Using the plate as reference, which appears to be a standard small plate (around 20-22 cm diameter), the bread slice covers about one third of the plate surface. Given this and the visible thickness of the slice (about 1.5 to 2 cm), the bread is a standard single slice, with no toppings or additions to add weight. Typical whole grain bread slices of this size weigh between 35 and 45 grams. Considering the moderately dense crumb visible and thickness about 1.7 cm, I estimate the bread slice weight to be approximately 40 grams.\",\n  \"pain\": 40\n}",

The cereals appear to be a mix of granola clusters and flakes, with some pieces visibly submerged but mostly at the surface. The bowl is shallow to medium depth, and the milk fill level is about 80% of the bowl's height. Compared to the spoon in the background, the bowl diameter is approximately 12 cm. The visible cereal layer appears spread evenly with some small gaps, suggesting a thickness of roughly 1 to 1.5 cm for the cereal layer above the milk. Considering the density of granola and flakes (typically around 0.3 to 0.5 g/cm3 when dry), and factoring in partial milk absorption and submersion, the cereal weight is moderate. Estimating the effective volume of cereals around 50-70 cm3 and applying density gives a weight range between 20-35 g. Being conservative and leaning towards the middle of this range based on visual cues, I estimate the cereals to weigh approximately 28 grams.\",\n  \"céréales\": 28\n}",

The target food item is 'côtes de bettes à la sauce tomate', which is the vegetable stew-like dish in the bowl. Visually, the dish appears as a mixture of cooked green leaves and stems (swiss chard) in a tomato-based liquid sauce. The portion occupies roughly two-thirds of a medium-sized bowl, with visible leaves and stems partially submerged in the sauce. The bowl diameter appears to be about 15 cm judging by typical bowl sizes. The vegetables show some volume and texture, indicating they are cooked but not pureed, with some liquid visible on top. The depth of the vegetable and sauce mixture likely fills about half the depth of the bowl, estimated to be around 4 cm deep inside the bowl, suggesting a volume of approximately 280-350 ml. Considering cooked vegetables have a density close to 1 g/ml, especially in a sauce, this gives roughly 280-350 grams of the vegetable mixture. Since this includes sauce but the weight requested is only for the vegetables (no clarification to exclude the sauce was given, so the whole portion is taken), I estimate the total weight at around 300 grams as a reasonable midpoint. Therefore, the weight estimation for 'côtes de bettes à la sauce tomate' is 300 grams.\",\n  \"côtes de bettes à la sauce tomate\": 300\n}",

The butter is spread thinly but covers most of the inner surface of these two bread pieces. Given the visible amount and the typical spread thickness of butter, the butter layer thickness appears to be around 2-3 mm. Knowing that butter is dense, about 0.9 g/cm3, and estimating the surface area of the butter spread on each piece to be roughly 35-40 cm2, the volume of butter per piece is approximately 7-12 grams. Since two pieces have butter visible, the total butter weight is roughly 14-20 grams.

Each tofu piece looks about 2-3 cm in length, approximately 1.5-2 cm in width, and about 1.5-2 cm in thickness based on the visible edges and comparison with adjacent carrot shreds and avocado slices. The tofu has a somewhat dense structure but is more porous and light compared to meats. A rough density for tofu is about 0.8 g/cm³. Assuming each piece averages roughly 8-10 cm³ (a volume of about 2.5 cm x 2 cm x 1.5 cm), each piece weighs roughly between 6.4 and 8 grams. Multiplying by 7 pieces gives a range of approximately 45 to 56 grams.

Each brioche au chocolat is round, about the size of a small palm, and has chocolate chunks spread across the surface. Their thickness and density appear consistent with typical brioche texture: slightly dense, soft, and enriched with butter and sugar which increases density relative to plain bread. The two brioches are roughly the same size and shape. Considering their size relative to the surface texture and comparing to the walnut roll which looks slightly denser, the average brioche au chocolat weighs approximately 70 grams each.

Focusing only on the corn, I observe the corn kernels form a mound roughly 8 cm by 6 cm in area and about 1.5 cm thick on average. The corn pieces are densely packed without much empty space, consistent with typical canned corn density. Using the visual comparison with the plate diameter (~22 cm) and other ingredients around, the corn volume corresponds roughly to 70-80 cubic centimeters. Given the density of canned corn is about 0.8 g/cm³, this translates to a weight range of approximately 56-64 grams.
