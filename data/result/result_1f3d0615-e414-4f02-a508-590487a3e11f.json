The specified food is 'salade de pâtes' which I located visually as the pile of spiral pasta mixed with small pieces of vegetables at the bottom left of the plate. There is no commercial package visible; it is a loose pasta salad portion. The plate serves as the primary reference object, estimated to be a standard dinner plate about 26 cm in diameter. The pasta salad occupies roughly an area of about 8 cm by 6 cm on the plate surface and appears to be about 2 cm thick. Calculating the geometric volume, length × width × height = 8 cm × 6 cm × 2 cm = 96 cubic centimeters. Since salad pasta is somewhat loose but not very airy, a packing factor of around 0.6 applies, giving an effective volume of 96 × 0.6 = 57.6 ml. Density for cooked pasta salad with vegetables is approximately 1 g/ml (similar to water in density due to moisture content). This gives a low-high range based on packing factor variations (0.5 to 0.7) of volume between 48 and 67 ml, equating to 48 to 67 grams. Typical single portions of pasta salad are in the 70-100 gram range, but here the portion looks somewhat small. The physical capacity on the plate and the scale are consistent with this estimate, comfortably within 90% of the possible volume. Hence the best estimate for weight of this 'salade de pâtes' portion is near the midpoint at about 58 grams.\",\n  \"salade de pâtes\": 58\n}",

The specified food is tarte aux fraises, a strawberry tart slice visible on a standard dessert plate, approximately 20 cm diameter. The tart slice occupies about one quarter of the plate's area. Estimating the tart slice dimensions visually: length about 9 cm, width about 5 cm, and height about 3 cm. The geometric volume is therefore about 9 × 5 × 3 = 135 cm³. Considering the tart is a mixed solid with fruit and cream and a pastry base, use packing factor of 0.7 to account for air gaps and uneven texture. Effective volume becomes 135 × 0.7 = 94.5 cm³. Density for tarte aux fraises, combining crust, cream and strawberry fruit, is estimated around 0.9 g/cm³. Multiplying effective volume by density gives 94.5 × 0.9 = 85 grams approximately. Sanity checks: Typical single slice of strawberry tart weighs around 80-120 g, and this estimate fits well within that range. Volume is below 90% capacity of the plate area and height, so plausible.

In the image, no visible container of oil is present as a separate puddle or bottle on the plate, so we infer if any linseed oil is included, it would be lightly spread or drizzled onto the food. Linseed oil has a density close to 0.93 g/ml. Typical single-use serving oils for dressing or cooking on a plate are about 5–15 ml (≈5–14 g). Comparing to the plate (a standard dinner plate or bowl about 22–24 cm diameter), the total food portion is moderate, so the amount of oil drizzled cannot be large (and visually there is no visible oily puddle). To be conservative and plausible, I estimate 1 tablespoon max, about 10 ml, density 0.93 g/ml gives roughly 9 grams. The low-high range might be 5–15 ml (4.7 to 14 g), but visually likely closer to the lower end as oil is not prominently visible. The estimate 9 grams is plausible as a light drizzle of oil on this serving without visible excess, and fits typical portion sizes for dressings. It also does not exceed any container or plate capacity, and makes sense nutritionally and visually. Thus, the best estimate for oil de lin is 9 grams.\",\n  \"huile de lin\": 9\n}",

The slice of tart is roughly triangular and measures approximately 12 cm at the longest edge and about 7 cm wide at its widest part, with a height (thickness) of about 1.5 cm. The container is a flat plate, so the maximum height estimate is appropriate. The geometric volume is roughly 12 cm × 7 cm × 1.5 cm × 0.5 (triangle area factor) = 63 cm³. The tart is a baked item with a pastry base and rhubarb topping, so its density is closer to that of dense solids; I estimate about 1 g/cm³, as pastry and cooked fruit have near water density. Because the tart is fairly compact, no packing correction is needed. A plausible weight range accounting for some uncertainty is 55-75 g. A typical slice of rhubarb tart weighs about 60-70 g, matching this range. Relative to the plate and utensils, the slice size and thickness look consistent with this estimate.

The specified food is 'poivron' (bell pepper), located as the sliced red strips on the plate to the left of the cooked chicken pieces. No packaging is involved here. For scale calibration, the plate is likely a standard dinner plate around 26-28 cm diameter, based on the wrap size. The visible portion of poivron appears to cover roughly an area about 8 cm by 3 cm with an estimated average thickness of about 0.8 cm. This gives a geometric volume of 8 x 3 x 0.8 = 19.2 cm³. Bell pepper slices are loose, so a packing factor of approximately 0.6 is applied to account for air gaps, making an effective volume of 19.2 x 0.6 = 11.52 cm³. Density of raw bell pepper is about 0.3 to 0.4 g/ml; we choose 0.35 g/ml as an average. Multiplying volume by density gives an estimated weight of 11.52 x 0.35 = ~4.0 g. Considering some uncertainty in volume estimation and packing factor, a plausible weight range is 3 to 6 grams. Compared to typical single serving raw bell pepper slices (around 30-50 g), this serving looks quite small, consistent with the visual portion on the plate. Capacity of the plate area for the poivron estimate is well under 90% of maximum volume. Thus, the final estimate for poivron weight is 4 grams.\",\n  \"poivron\": 4\n}",

The specified food is 'muesli nature', which is visually located in the small orange bowl on the right. It is not commercially packaged, so we estimate by portion size. Typical single-serve muesli portions are around 30-50 g. For scale, the bowl is roughly 10 cm in diameter, visible relative to the white dish next to it and the table surface. The muesli pieces are chunky but loosely packed, so a packing factor of about 0.6 is suitable to account for air gaps. The estimated volume of the muesli is approximately a hemisphere shape about 10 cm diameter and 4 cm high, giving a geometric volume around 314 cm³ × 0.6 packing = ~188 cm³ effective volume. Muesli density is approximately 0.4 g/cm³ (raw cereal mix with air). Multiplying volume by density gives 188 × 0.4 = 75 g.

The tomatoes are sliced and arranged on a standard dinner plate approximately 26-28 cm in diameter. The plate is filled mostly with tomato slices, spread over an area roughly 20 cm in diameter and a fill height of about 1.5 cm. Geometric volume is approximately a flattened cylinder: π * (10 cm)^2 * 1.5 cm ≈ 471 cm³. Considering the air between slices, a packing factor of about 0.6 is applied, leading to an effective volume of about 283 cm³. Tomato density is roughly 0.9 g/ml (close to water but slightly less due to air pockets in flesh). So estimated weight is volume × density = 283 × 0.9 ≈ 255 g. Low-high range with packing factor uncertainty 0.5 to 0.7 gives 237 g to 331 g. This aligns well with typical single portion tomato salad weights (200-300 g). The volume fills about 60-70% of the plate surface area with a low height, below 90% capacity, making the estimate plausible. Oil, vinegar, and flax seeds contribute minimal additional weight and are excluded from tomato estimate.

The cheese cubes are roughly 2 cm x 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm each, with four visible cubes. Total geometric volume per cube is about 4.5 cm3, times 4 cubes equals 18 cm3. Cheese is a dense solid with a density approximately 1.1 g/cm3. Packing factor is 1.0 since the cubes are solid with no air gaps. Therefore, estimated weight = 18 cm3 x 1.1 g/cm3 = 19.8 g. Low-high range allowing ±20%: 16–24 g. This is plausible given typical small cheese portions.

The sprouts form a loose pile with an estimated area of about 10 cm by 7 cm and a fill height roughly 1.5 cm. The geometric volume is then about 10 x 7 x 1.5 = 105 cm³. Since these are loose, airy sprouts with a lot of air gaps, a packing factor of 0.5 is appropriate. Effective volume becomes 105 x 0.5 = 52.5 ml. Density for raw sprouts is low, about 0.3 g/ml. So estimated mass is 52.5 x 0.3 = 15.75 g. Considering possible errors, a low-high range might be 12–20 g. Typical serving of sprouted seeds is small, around 15 g, matching our estimate.

Even considering volume and density (density close to 1 g/ml for yogurt, volume roughly 150 ml), it is consistent with the standard 150 g portion size.

The courgette and onions occupy about half the container area, roughly 7 cm x 7 cm. The visible fill height is approximately 2.5 cm given the relatively flat layering. The geometric volume equals approximately 7 cm * 7 cm * 2.5 cm = 122.5 cm3. Since it is cooked vegetables, which includes onions and courgettes—a loose, moist vegetable mix with some air gaps—we apply a packing factor of about 0.6. Effective volume after packing is 122.5 * 0.6 = 73.5 cm3. The density of cooked courgettes and onions is approximately 0.5 g/cm3 considering water content and softness. Thus, estimated weight range considering packing factor uncertainty (0.5 to 0.7) is roughly 61 to 86 grams. Typical portion sizes for cooked mixed vegetables on a plate are around 80-120 g, and the volume occupied fits a typical cooked vegetable side portion.

The container is placed on a wooden desk, with no other reference objects immediately visible, but the container looks like a typical square lunchbox approximately 16 x 16 cm in footprint and 4-5 cm deep. Each galette is roughly 6 cm long, 3-4 cm wide, and about 1.5 cm thick, making the geometric volume per galette about 36 cm3 (6 x 3 x 2) conservatively. Four galettes gives about 144 cm3 total geometric volume. Considering the galettes are made from millet, black beans, and corn, a somewhat dense mixture, the packing factor for this compact food is close to 1 (no air gaps inside the patties), so effective volume = 144 ml. The density for cooked legume and grain patties is close to 1 g/ml; thus the mass is about 144 g. Typical single millet bean patties weigh around 35-45 g each, so for four patties 140-180 g total fits well. The container’s capacity plausibly exceeds 200 g for this amount. So the estimate of about 140-180 g fit all checks.

The pasta occupies roughly half the tray, approximately 15 cm by 10 cm. The pile height seems to be about 2.5 cm. The geometric volume is therefore approximately 15 cm × 10 cm × 2.5 cm = 375 cm³. Pasta is somewhat irregular and loosely packed, so apply a packing factor between 0.5 and 0.7; taking 0.6 for this estimate. The effective volume is 375 × 0.6 = 225 cm³. Density of cooked pasta is about 0.9 to 1.1 g/cm³; take 1 g/cm³ for simplicity. This gives an estimated weight range from 375 × 0.5 × 1 = 187.5 g (low) to 375 × 0.7 × 1 = 262.5 g (high), midpoint about 225 g. Compared to a typical portion size, this is in a reasonable range.

The salade portion occupies an area about 6 cm by 6 cm, with a fill height estimated around 1.5 cm since it is leafy and not piled high. This gives a crude geometric volume of 6 x 6 x 1.5 = 54 cm³. Since salad is loose with air gaps, I apply a packing factor between 0.4 and 0.6. Using 0.5 as a midpoint, the effective volume is 54 x 0.5 = 27 cm³. The density for raw vegetables and salad leaves is between 0.2 and 0.5 g/cm³, and I choose 0.4 g/cm³ as a reasonable mid-value as this salad contains leafy greens and some dressing or bits.

The sautéed vegetables appear to take up about one-third of the plate surface, roughly 8 cm by 8 cm in visible length and width. The height or thickness of the vegetables on the plate appears to be about 2.5 cm. Calculating the geometric volume: 8 cm × 8 cm × 2.5 cm = 160 cm³.

This yields a geometric volume of approximately 14 cm × 9 cm × 1.5 cm = 189 cm³. The packing factor for scrambled eggs, which are fluffy but dense, is around 0.8 to account for air pockets. Applying the packing factor: 189 cm³ × 0.8 = 151.2 ml effective volume. The density of scrambled eggs is close to that of cooked egg, approximately 0.9 g/ml, due to water content and air inclusion.

For a low-high estimate, considering possible thickness variation and packing factor from 0.7 to 0.9, mass could range from about 120 g to 155 g. Typical single portions of scrambled eggs are about 100-150 g, and the physical capacity of the portion is well below 90% of the plate surface capacity, making this estimate plausible.

Bread density is about 0.25-0.30 g/cm³. Single slice weights typically range from 40-60 g depending on thickness. Here, the slices are of standard thickness and texture for dense whole wheat bread. Estimating 2 slices at around 50 g each is plausible, but since only one slice is visible alone, the estimate concerns a single slice. Therefore, a single slice of pain bis weighs approximately 50 g, consistent with typical portion size and plate-hand scale. Volume-wise, one slice roughly 12x7x1.5 cm = 126 cm³; at 0.25 g/cm³ density, this corresponds to about 31.5 g.

Plate area ~ π * (13.5 cm)^2 ≈ 570 cm^2, so half is about 285 cm^2. Multiplying by height 2 cm gives geometric volume of 570 cm^3. Applying a packing factor for loose, irregular chips around 0.5 (considering air gaps), effective volume = 285 cm^3. Density for chips made mostly from beans and light frying is slightly less than water, approximately 0.75-0.85 g/cm^3; using midpoint 0.8 g/cm^3 gives mass ~ 228 grams. Low-high range considering packing factor variations (0.4-0.7) and density changes (0.75-0.85) gives roughly 170 g to 300 g. Considering typical commercial chip portion sizes usually range 25-50 g for snacks, but this is an entire plate serving, so around 200-250 g is plausible.

Bread is porous with air pockets, so applying a packing factor of about 0.5 to account for the volume of air inside bread. Effective volume thus is 210 cm3 x 0.5 = 105 cm3. The density of bread is around 0.25 to 0.3 g/cm3 because of its porous nature. Using 0.27 g/cm3 as an average density, estimated weight: 105 cm3 x 0.27 g/cm3 = 28.35 g. Typical weight for a single slice of bread ranges from 25-35 g depending on slice thickness and type, so this estimate is plausible.

Butter typically adds about 5-7 g for such a spread, while mélasse, a syrupy substance, likely adds about 5-8 g given the thin coverage. The total for the tartine includes the bread plus toppings. Summing these: bread 45 g + butter 6 g + mélasse 7 g = 58 g approximately. Geometric volume analysis corresponds to this: slice dimensions approx. 14 x 6 x 1.5 cm = 126 cm³, but as bread is porous and light (density ~0.3 g/cm³), volume to weight aligns with about 40-50 g bread. The butter and mélasse layers add minimal volume but higher density (~0.9-1.4 g/cm³), contributing 10-15 g. The 58 g final estimate fits well within the plate's capacity and typical portion size for such a tartine. Low-high range considered 50-65 g to allow spread thickness variance. Therefore, 58 g is a reasonable, plausible estimate.\",\n  \"tartine mélasse + beurre\": 58\n}",

The geometric volume is estimated as 4 cm × 5 cm × 1.5 cm = 30 cm³. Mayonnaise is dense and creamy, so packing factor is not applied (solid emulsion), density taken as approximately 0.9 to 1.0 g/ml. Using 1 g/ml density for simplicity. Thus effective mass estimate is approximately 30 g. Considering typical single-portion ranges and physical capacity of that dollop on the plate, the estimate is plausible and within normal portion size.

The geometric volume is therefore approximately π × (5 cm)^2 × 2.5 cm ≈ 196 cm3. Since the salad is made up of shredded carrots, corn kernels, and halved cherry tomatoes, it is a mix of raw vegetables and some creamy dressing or sauce visible, making the density and packing factor key. We apply a packing factor of about 0.6 to account for air spaces in the loose salad. The effective volume is 196 cm3 × 0.6 = 118 cm3. Density is likely around 0.7 g/ml given the moist raw vegetables with dressing. Thus weight estimate ranges from 0.6 × 118 = 71 g to 0.8 × 118 = 94 g. The typical single portion weight for such a mixed vegetable salad is approximately 70-100 g, which agrees well with capacity and visual observation on the plate (filling less than 90% of the plate area assigned).

There are three strawberries visible, so total estimated weight ranges from 54 g (3 x 18 g) to 75 g (3 x 25 g). Using the bowl size and relative volume, it's clear the strawberries roughly fill less than 90% of the bowl's capacity, which would far exceed this weight range if fully packed.

Therefore, the geometric volume is approximately 8 cm × 8 cm × 3 cm = 192 cm³. Salade de céleri is a raw vegetable salad, so it has a lot of air space between shreds; applying a packing factor between 0.4 and 0.6 accounts for this. Taking a midpoint packing factor of 0.5, effective volume is 192 × 0.5 = 96 ml. Density for raw vegetable salads is between 0.2 and 0.5 g/ml, here 0.4 g/ml is chosen as a reasonable estimate for shredded celery salad with some dressing. This results in a weight range from 96 × 0.2 = 19 g to 96 × 0.5 = 48 g, midpoint about 34 g. Typical portion sizes for celery root salad servings range from 30 to 60 g, so this estimate fits well.

The cheese wedge appears about 5 cm long, 3 cm wide, and roughly 1.5 cm thick, giving a geometric volume estimate of 5 × 3 × 1.5 = 22.5 cm³. Cheese is dense solid with a density around 1 g/cm³ or slightly above; for such semi-soft cheeses, 1.0 g/cm³ is a reasonable estimate. Since the cheese is a solid wedge, packing factor is 1 (no air gaps). Thus, effective volume is 22.5 cm³ × 1 = 22.5 ml, and weight estimate = 22.5 g. A typical single serving portion of tomme-type cheeses ranges from 20-30 grams, so this fits well. The cheese takes only a small fraction of the plate area and volume, well under 90% capacity, confirming plausibility.

Visually, chia seeds are dispersed throughout the mixture and are not isolated; they appear swollen from absorbing liquid, increasing their volume. Typically, dry chia seeds weigh about 1.3 g/ml, but in this hydrated state, their density is closer to 1 g/ml due to water absorption. The chia seeds account for approximately 10-15% of the total visible mixture volume when considering the distribution in the jar. Given the jar's volume is around 300 ml, 15% volume corresponds to ~45 ml of chia seeds mixture, but actual dry chia seed weight is less as they absorb water and expand. The typical portion for chia seeds ranges from 15 to 30 grams for consumption.

The density of blueberries is close to water, about 1 g/cm³. Multiplying volume by density gives approximately 191 g. Allowing for uncertainty (packing factor 0.5-0.7) yields a range of about 159-223 g.

The raspberries can be counted as discrete units; there are 6 visible raspberries. A typical raspberry weighs about 3-5 grams each depending on size. Comparing the raspberries to the strawberries and the Nutella slice, they appear medium-sized, so an average of 4 grams per raspberry is plausible. Therefore, 6 raspberries times 4 grams = 24 grams. Considering possible hidden raspberries underneath, a small allowance of 1 raspberry is added, making 7 raspberries total, or 28 grams.

To calibrate scale, the apple is placed on a flat surface with visible grain and texture similar to a standard table or desk surface. No direct standard objects like plates or utensils are visible for precise scaling; however, the apple's size compared to the texture and shadowing suggests it is a small to medium apple, not large. Average diameter of a small to medium apple is around 6.5-7 cm. We approximate the apple as an oblate spheroid (roughly spherical) with volume calculated as 4/3 * π * r³, where r ≈ 3.25 cm, generating a volume roughly 140 cm³. Apple flesh has a density close to water, around 0.85-0.95 g/cm³ due to air pockets and fibrous texture. Using 0.9 g/cm³ as density, estimated weight is volume × density = 140 × 0.9 = 126 grams. Given slight variability in apple size and density, a low-high range would be 110 to 140 grams.

Since hummous is a dense, creamy paste, the packing factor is near 1 (approximately 0.9-1.1), so I'll use 1 for simplicity. Thus, effective volume is about 36 ml. Density for hummous is about 1 g/ml. Therefore, estimated weight is about 36 grams. This fits well with a small single serving, less than typical commercial hummous tubs (45–70 g).

Since pasta is moderately dense, cooked pasta density is approximately 1 g/cm³ (since cooked pasta absorbs water and is dense but not stiff).

This gives a geometric volume of 10 cm x 3.5 cm x 1.5 cm = 52.5 cm³. Avocado density is roughly 0.9 g/cm³ due to its creamy texture.

Low-high range considering slight error in thickness (±0.5 cm) and density (±0.1 g/cm³) results in roughly 60-85 grams. The midpoint ~72 g fits typical portion weights and visual assessment. Thus final estimate is 72 grams.\",\n  \"galette millet maïs haricots noirs\": 72\n}",

The specified food item is 'tomates cerises' (cherry tomatoes), which are located in a small cardboard tray. The tomatoes are not in a commercial sealed package, so we rely on typical weights and visual estimation. Reference objects include the book and the fabric pattern underneath, but crucially the cardboard tray size is comparable to a small dessert plate dimension (~20 cm length). The tomatoes are densely packed in one layer with some small gaps. Each cherry tomato is roughly spherical with a diameter around 2.5 to 3.0 cm. There are about 18 tomatoes visible, and typically a cherry tomato weighs around 15-20 grams. Estimating volume: each tomato’s volume ~ (4/3)*π*(1.3 cm)^3 ≈ 9.2 cubic cm. Total geometric volume for 18 tomatoes = 18 × 9.2 = 165.6 cubic cm. Since the tomatoes are solids and nearly spherical with little air inside, packing factor is close to 1 after counting each tomato's volume individually. Density of tomatoes is close to water, about 0.95 g/cm³ due to high water content. Total weight estimate = 165.6 × 0.95 ≈ 157 g. Sanity check: 18 tomatoes × 15-20 g = 270-360 g, but cherry tomatoes typically weigh closer to 15 g smaller variety; visual size here suggests somewhat smaller tomatoes, so 15 g per tomato is an upper bound. The cardboard tray is approximately 20 cm long, 8-9 cm wide, so max flat volume is ~144 cm² in base area; with tomatoes of 3 cm height stacked tightly, capacity ~432 cm³, our estimated volume is well below 90% of total tray volume, which is plausible. Considering variability, a low-high range of 140-170 g is reasonable. Final chosen estimate: 160 g.\",\n  \"tomates cerises\": 160\n}",

The specified food is a 'barre de chocolat kinder,' located in the center of the image resting on a wooden surface. It is not in a commercial package visible here but is a single chocolate bar. Standard single-serve Kinder chocolate bars typically weigh about 21 grams. For scale calibration, the wooden plank grooves visible beneath are about 3-4 cm wide judging by typical wood grain dimensions, and the bar length matches roughly 10-11 cm, consistent with a small chocolate bar. The chocolate bar is dense solid with a density about 1.0 g/ml. Volume estimation: length approx 10.5 cm, width approx 2.5 cm, height approx 1.5 cm = 39.375 cm³ geometric volume. Since it is solid chocolate, no air gaps, so packing factor is 1.0, effective volume = 39.375 ml. Estimated mass from volume and density = approx 39 grams, but this is higher than typical commercial Kinder bars which are known to be about 21 grams per bar. Considering the standard packaging size and typical weights is more reliable here. The volume-based estimate includes some margin error due to judging height but still, standard Kinder bars weigh about 21 grams, which fits usual commercial info. The physical capacity of the wood surface is large enough to hold the bar. The final best estimate matches known commercial weight rather than volume-based guess, corrected by typical commercial info. Therefore, estimated weight is 21 grams.\",\n  \"barre de chocolat kinder\": 21\n}",

The specified food is 'blevita,' which are visible as four stacked rectangular crispbreads on a wooden surface. There is no commercial packaging visible, so we consider typical portion weights. A single Blevita crispbread typically weighs about 15-18 grams. Reference object used is the wooden table's visible grain and typical size of crispbreads, which are generally about 7 cm x 10 cm and approximately 0.5 cm thick. The geometric volume per crispbread can be estimated as 7 cm x 10 cm x 0.5 cm = 35 cm³ per crispbread. Stacking four gives 140 cm³ total volume. Considering crispbread is porous but dense, packing factor near 1 applies and density roughly 0.9-1 g/cm³, so volume closely matches weight in grams. Weight per crispbread estimate around 15-18 grams, so four crispbreads would be roughly 60-72 grams. This aligns well with geometric volume and known product weights. Therefore, a good final estimate is 65 grams.\",\n  \"blevita\": 65\n}",

The slice of bread is roughly 12 cm long and 6 cm wide, giving a bread surface area of approximately 72 cm². The mélasse spread is thin, around 1–2 mm thick since it is a syrupy spread, so we estimate the volume by multiplying 72 cm² by 0.15 cm thickness, resulting in roughly 10.8 cm³. Molasses has a density close to 1.4 g/ml (heavier than water due to sugar content). Therefore, the estimated weight is 10.8 g × 1.4 = 15.1 g. Considering the thin coverage and some variability, a plausible range is 12–18 g. Typical single-serve molasses spreads are about 10–20 g on bread, so this fits with expected portion size.

The salad is loose leafy greens with some seeds visible. The height is low, estimated conservatively at 2 cm since salad leaves are loosely piled. The geometric volume is therefore approximately 13 cm × 8 cm × 2 cm = 208 cm³. Considering a packing factor for leafy salad of about 0.4 to 0.5 due to air gaps, the effective volume is 208 × 0.45 = 93.6 ml. The density for raw salad greens is about 0.3 g/ml. Multiplying, the mass range is 208 × 0.4 × 0.3 = 25 g (low) to 208 × 0.5 × 0.3 = 31 g (high). Typical side salad portions are 80–150 g, indicating this portion is smaller than a typical side salad. The salad covers less than half of the plate with a small pile height, so this smaller amount is plausible. The plate capacity and distribution confirm this weight is reasonable and below 90% of the volume possible there.

The chocolate is in a commercial package typical for Swiss chocolate bars which commonly weigh around 40-45 grams for single-serve sizes such as KitKat or similar products. Given the similar size and packaging style, it is reasonable to assign a weight close to that standard. The geometric volume, estimated roughly as 10 cm × 3 cm × 1 cm = 30 cm³, with chocolate density about 1.3 g/cm³ for milk chocolate, results in about 39 grams, in line with the commercial portion size. The chocolate is solid and dense, so no packing factor adjustment is necessary. The low-high plausible range is about 35 to 45 grams, fitting typical single-serve chocolate bar weights and the physical dimensions and packaging observed here.

The pizza slices occupy most of the plate, leaving some empty space, indicating a total pizza diameter of roughly 24 cm. The pizza appears thin-crust with moderate toppings. Typical thin-crust vegetable pizzas weigh around 250-350 grams for a full 24 cm pizza. The visible portion on the plate is about 4 slices out of approximately 6 slices, roughly two-thirds of the pizza by area. Thus, the pizza portion shown is about two-thirds of 280 g (a median value for thin-crust veggie pizza), approximately 185 g total. The weight is mostly dough, cheese, and the vegetables champignons (mushrooms), olives, and courgettes (zucchini). Considering the specified food is this entire pizza portion, not just one topping, the estimate covers the whole visible pizza because the named food encompasses all toppings. The density for pizza is roughly 0.8-0.9 g/cm3, validated by known portion weights. Sanity checks: the plate capacity is large enough for this mass, the portion is reasonable as a meal serving.

The plate is a standard dinner plate about 26-28 cm in diameter, providing reference for scale. The salad roughly covers about one third of the plate surface, around a circle segment of roughly 9-10 cm diameter. The salad appears loosely packed and layered with leaves, carrot strips, and small chunks of avocado. Given the visible portion, approximate length and width might be about 10 cm by 9 cm, with a maximum height (thickness) of about 3 cm. The geometric volume is approximately 10 cm × 9 cm × 3 cm = 270 cm³. Applying a packing factor of about 0.6 for a mixed leafy and chunky salad to account for air gaps, the effective volume is 270 × 0.6 = 162 cm³. Density for raw vegetables and avocado is estimated around 0.5 g/cm³ (leafy greens lower, avocado higher, so 0.5 is plausible average). Therefore, the weight estimate based on volume and density is 162 × 0.5 = 81 grams. For sanity checks, typical single side salad portions range between 80 to 150 grams, so 81 grams is plausible.

The kohlrabi pieces cover most of the lid surface in a single layer with an estimated fill height of approximately 1.5 cm. Geometric volume = length × width × height = 20 cm × 12 cm × 1.5 cm = 360 cm³. Applying a packing factor to account for air gaps between kohlrabi pieces, approximately 0.6 (since they are irregular chunks), the effective volume = 360 × 0.6 = 216 cm³. Density of raw kohlrabi is similar to that of raw vegetables, about 0.4 to 0.6 g/cm³. Taking a median density of 0.5 g/cm³ gives a weight range low-high from 0.4 × 216 = 86 grams to 0.6 × 216 = 130 grams. The midpoint is roughly 108 grams.

The spinach leaves cover roughly half of the plate's base, easily about 15 cm by 10 cm in visible area. The spinach is fresh leaves, slightly layered but quite flat, with estimated average height about 1 cm. This gives a geometric volume of approximately 150 cm3 (15 × 10 × 1). As fresh spinach is leafy with air gaps, a packing factor of about 0.4 to 0.5 is suitable to account for air volume. Applying this, effective volume is about 60 to 75 cm3. Spinach density is approximately 0.3 to 0.4 g/cm3 for fresh leaves. This results in a weight range of about 18 g (60 × 0.3) to 30 g (75 × 0.4).
