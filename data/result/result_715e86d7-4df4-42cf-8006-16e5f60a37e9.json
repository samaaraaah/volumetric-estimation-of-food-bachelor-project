Given the portion occupies a relatively small area and thickness on the plate compared to the meat and carrot salad, and considering Swiss cooked pasta portions typically range from 120 to 150 grams for a normal serving, this side portion appears smaller than a full serving. The pasta portion seems roughly half to two-thirds of a standard portion. Estimating a plausible range between 70 and 100 grams, a midpoint value of about 85 grams is appropriate for this salade de pâtes portion.

The slice contains a moderate amount of cream filling, a crispy tart crust which has some crumbled pieces on the plate, several large strawberry halves sitting on top, and a few red currants. The strawberries look fresh and relatively large. Considering the visible thickness of the cream and the crust, and comparing the plate size (a standard dessert plate) to the tart slice dimensions, the portion seems consistent with a slice of about 120g to 160g. The midpoint of this range would be about 140g. This estimate aligns with typical Swiss dessert slice portions which tend to be moderate rather than overly large.

Since no distinct pool or container of oil is visible, the amount present must be small, typical of an oil drizzle or mixed into the food. Standard serving size for oil in a meal preparation is about 10-15 grams (roughly one tablespoon). Considering the visible food portions and the likelihood that the oil is used as a dressing or cooking fat rather than a large separate amount, I estimate the huile de lin used here would be about 12 grams, within a plausible range of 8-15 grams.\",\n  \"huile de lin\": 12\n}",

The slice is medium thickness, with visible pieces of rhubarb embedded in a custard or cream filling with a pastry crust. The size of the slice appears to be about one eighth of a standard 24 cm tart, typical for a single serving. Given the density of the tart – consisting of cooked rhubarb which is mostly water, a creamy filling, and pastry crust – the weight of such a slice generally falls between 120 and 160 grams.

Typical cooked vegetable Swiss portions range from 200-300g for a main portion, but this serving is clearly smaller as a side element to the wrap and chicken. Visually estimating, the poivron weighs likely between 60 and 90 grams.

Given the size of the bowl relative to the white square dish of natural yogurt beside it (which helps provide scale), this bowl seems to hold roughly about one typical Swiss serving of muesli. Typically, a Swiss portion of dry muesli weighs around 40-60 grams depending on the cluster density. Here, the bowl looks quite full and the clusters are dense, so the weight leans towards the upper side of that range. Therefore, it's plausible to estimate a minimum-maximum range of 50 to 65 grams for this portion of muesli. The midpoint of about 58 grams aligns well with the visual evidence and portion norms. Thus, I estimate the muesli nature weighs approximately 58 grams.\",\n  \"muesli nature\": 58\n}",

Typical Swiss salad portions for vegetables range from 200-300g. Given the volume, fullness of the plate, and the medium size of the pieces, a reasonable estimate for the tomato salad weight is between 230-270 grams. The presence of some dressing (huile d'olive and vinaigre balsamique) and sprinkled seeds adds negligible weight in comparison.

Swiss salad portions typically range between 250-400g for large servings, but this is clearly a side portion. Given the size relative to the risotto portion (which looks like a modest serving), and considering the amount of visible volume and density of leafy greens and vegetables, a reasonable estimate would be between 70g and 100g.

Focusing on the pasta portion, it occupies a significant central area of the plate and is a typical Swiss main carbohydrate portion. The pasta is cooked fusilli, appearing fluffy but reasonably dense. Cooked pasta Swiss portions typically range around 180-250 grams. Given the visual fullness and the plate size referencing the forks and the other food items, this looks like a moderately sized portion rather than overly large or small.

A full slice of sandwich bread in Swiss portions usually weighs about 30-40 grams. Since only half a slice is shown, the weight of this piece of bread would be approximately half that amount. Considering the visible thickness and size, I estimate the weight of this half slice of bread to be about 18 grams, with a plausible range of 15-21 grams.

A whole medium avocado typically weighs around 150-200 grams including the skin and pit. The edible portion (without the skin and pit) roughly weighs about 130-160 grams. Since the slices here correspond to around half of the avocado flesh, estimating between 65 and 80 grams seems reasonable. Given the visible portion size and Swiss portion sizes, a weight around 75 grams is appropriate.

Typically, a full slice of this bread type weighs around 40-50 grams due to its density and size. Given that only two half slices are present (together forming roughly one full slice), the weight estimate should consider one full slice size. Considering Swiss bread portioning and the visible portion, a weight range of about 38-52 grams is plausible.

Tomato is mostly water and light in density, so even though it covers a decent area, the weight won't be very high. A typical medium tomato weighs roughly 120-150 grams, and visually this looks like less than one full tomato, roughly half to two-thirds of one.
