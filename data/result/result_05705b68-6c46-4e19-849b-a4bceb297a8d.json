The image shows a small amount of crème caramel in a somewhat shallow, transparent blue bowl held in one hand. The crème caramel appears to fill only the bottom center of the bowl with a thin to moderate layer. Given the typical creamy and dense texture of crème caramel (similar to custard), its density should be close to that of pudding, roughly 1 g/ml. Estimating the visible volume, it looks to be about 100-150 ml or grams, as the portion fills a small area with some slight thickness. Standard dessert portions of crème caramel are usually in the 120-180g range depending on serving size. Considering the small serving shown in the image and the portion filling only a part of the bowl's base, I estimate the crème caramel weighs about 130 grams, which aligns with plausible size and density for this dish.\",\n  \"crème caramel\": 130\n}",

The image shows a slice of 'délice des dieux', which consists of a biscuit base soaked with berry juice, topped with a creamy mixture of séré and mascarpone, and garnished with fresh red fruits: raspberries and blueberries. The slice is on a small dessert plate, allowing a scale reference. The biscuit base appears moist and dense, soaked with a dark red berry juice, while the creamy topping has a smooth, thick texture with visible thickness about 1.5-2 cm. The fruits placed on top are three raspberries and two blueberries, adding minor but noticeable weight. Typical Swiss dessert portion sizes for a slice like this usually range between 120-180g. Given the moist, dense composition and creamy topping, the density is relatively high. Considering the visible size, thickness, and density, and that desserts can sometimes be underestimated visually, I estimate the total weight to be toward the upper half of the range.

The waffles appear thick and dense, typical of sweet potato content. Each piece is roughly the size of a typical waffle quarter, about 8-10 cm per side, and the thickness appears around 2 cm. Considering the density of sweet potato waffles compared to normal waffles, they are heavier. A standard plain Belgian waffle weighs around 70-90g per quarter. Sweet potato waffles tend to be slightly denser and heavier, so I estimate approximately 90-120g per quarter piece. Since the image shows four pieces (one whole waffle), the total waffle weight would be around 360-480g. Focusing on only the waffle portion (not including the toppings), and given visual fullness and thickness, a reasonable estimate is about 400 grams total for the whole waffle.

Considering the volume and the typical weight of tomato pieces of this size, each piece might weigh around 15 grams. Fully counting the pieces and adjusting for some pieces slightly hidden or smaller, the total weight of tomatoes on the plate likely ranges between 120 and 160 grams. Given the apparent portion size and the typical Swiss portion ranges for vegetables like tomatoes, I will select an estimate in the upper half of that range.

The chili covers about half the plate and contains visible meat chunks and kidney beans in a thick tomato-based sauce. Given its dense and moist consistency, chili is a dense legume and meat dish. Typically, a Swiss portion of legume-based dishes like chili ranges from 250 to 350 grams. Considering the volume on the plate—covering half the plate with substantial thickness—and density of the ingredients, the chili portion likely weighs near the higher end of this range.

The image shows a glass container divided into two portions: on the left, cooked courgette and onions, and on the right, millet patties with black beans and corn. The target food is 'courgette et oignons.' The cooked courgettes and onions appear to fill about half of the container's volume, roughly a rectangular space about 10 cm by 8 cm in the container, and about 2-3 cm deep. These are cooked vegetables, so their density is quite high, close to 0.8-1.0 g/ml. Estimating the volume around 160-200 ml, the raw weight might be roughly similar due to moisture retained. Swiss portion reference for cooked vegetables is around 150-300g, but knowing these are dense cooked veggies in a substantial portion filling half the container, it is likely at the upper end. The visual volume and density suggest an initial estimate about 180-230g. Considering the adjustment for dense cooked vegetable dishes (increasing by about 40-60%) due to typical underestimation, I increase the weight estimate to approximately 275 grams. This fits well with visual cues, container size, and the proportion relative to the other food items visible in the container.

Focusing on the mashed potatoes, they occupy a sizable portion of the plate's central area. The portion is thick and covers a moderate surface area roughly 10-12 cm in diameter and about 1.5-2 cm in thickness. Given the density of mashed potatoes (generally around 0.8 g/ml) and the volume visible, my initial rough estimate is around 140-180g. Since mashed potatoes can be denser and heavier than they seem, I lean towards the upper half of this range. Additionally, mashed potatoes are a dense vegetable-based dish, so I apply the critical adjustment to increase the estimate by about 40-60%, pushing it towards approximately 190-230g. Comparing this to Swiss portion references (typical vegetable cooked dish portions 150-300g), this estimate fits well within a plausible range.

Typical individual blueberries weigh approximately 0.5 to 1 gram, and Swiss portions for blueberries often range between 150-200 grams, but this is a smaller portion. Since the blueberries are fresh and unprocessed, their density and weight per piece are standard. Estimating around 0.8 grams per blueberry, the total visible portion of blueberries approximates between 8 and 12 grams.

A whole banana typically weighs around 120-150 grams including the peel, with the edible portion being about 100-130 grams. Since this banana is peeled and appears to be approximately half the length of an average banana, I estimate the weight to be roughly half that of a whole peeled banana, about 60-70 grams.

Considering the visible volume and the creamy nature of the dish which adds some weight, the pasta quantity looks consistent with a typical Swiss serving size for cooked pasta, around 150-200g. The cheese (gruyère) sprinkled on top appears to be roughly one to two tablespoons, which would weigh around 15-25g, but since the target food is specifically the pâtes carbonara (the main pasta dish including sauce and meat), the cheese topping should be excluded from this estimate. Based on the volume and typical density of such creamy pasta dishes, I estimate the weight of the pâtes carbonara (pasta with sauce and meat) portion to be approximately 180 grams.\",\n  \"pâtes carbonara\": 180\n}",

The size of the slice is about a typical dessert portion, roughly one sixth to one eighth of a whole tart. The crust pieces and cream indicate a medium thickness, and the strawberries appear fresh and fairly large. Considering an average whole tarte aux fraises typically weighs around 600-700 grams including crust, cream, and fruit topping, the slice here would be around 1/6th to 1/8th of that. That suggests a weight range approximately between 75 grams (1/8 of 600g) to 115 grams (1/6 of 700g). Given some cream and fruit density, a slightly higher estimate within this range is reasonable.

The butter spread appears thin but covers a significant portion of the bread, likely adding around 5-7 grams. The chestnut cream layer is also thin but covers most of the slice, possibly adding about 10-12 grams. Combining these elements, the total weight of the tartine with butter and chestnut cream is estimated to be approximately 45-60 grams. Since the item is dense due to the chestnut cream, I choose a value in the upper half of this range, around 55 grams, for better accuracy.\",\n  \"tartine avec crème de marrons et beurre\": 55\n}",

Given the dimensions, this piece likely occupies a volume of roughly 30-40 cm³. Multiplying volume by density gives an estimated weight of about 33-44 grams. Considering some visual uncertainty and the thickness appearing closer to 1.7-2 cm on average, I choose the upper half of this range.

Typically, an onion sauce serving accompanying a roast in a Swiss meal is roughly between 30-60 grams. Given the visible amount, the partial coverage around the meat, and the moderate quantity of onions in the sauce, I estimate the weight closer to the upper half of this range because some of the sauce is pooled and soaked into the meat.

Considering their volume relative to the plate size and comparing to the pasta portion nearby, the beans form a dense and compact portion roughly covering a small quarter of the plate. Given that cooked legumes weigh approximately 250-350g per serving with typical Swiss portions and legumes are known to be underestimated visually, I estimate the initial visual weight to be around 150-200g. Applying the critical adjustment for dense legume dishes (+40-60%), the weight increases significantly to about 230-320g.

Puff pastry is light but the layering adds some density, and the tomato sauce adds moisture weight. Typical small feuilletés of this size weigh about 30-40 grams. Given the visible size and typical density, and considering Swiss portion contexts where small filled pastries often weigh around 30-50 grams, I estimate the weight to be closer to the upper part of this range to avoid underestimation.

A single slice of sandwich bread generally weighs around 30-40 grams before toasting, and toasting does not significantly change the weight. Since the toast is partially spread with a thin layer of fromage frais, we only estimate the bread weight itself here.
