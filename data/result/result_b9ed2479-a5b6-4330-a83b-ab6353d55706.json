The portion appears moderate, with pasta spirals mixed with small visible vegetables like tomato and corn. The amount is roughly the volume of a small handful of pasta, not heaped. Considering Swiss portion sizes, cooked pasta servings are typically around 120-150 grams. Since this portion is slightly below a full serving size (as there is also a significant portion of carrot salad and meat on the same plate), it probably weighs a bit less than a full serving. I estimate a minimum-maximum range of 90-120 grams and a midpoint estimate of around 105 grams. This aligns well with the visible volume and the presence of other dishes on the plate, making it a plausible and balanced portion for a meal.\",\n  \"salade de pâtes\": 105\n}",

The slice appears to be a modest portion, roughly a sixth or an eighth of a standard tart given the plate size and the amount of crumbs. The strawberries on top look like about 6-7 medium strawberries or halves, which aligns with about 90-140 grams of strawberries assuming 15-20g per strawberry. However, since this is a mixed tart portion, the total weight of the slice including the crust, cream, and strawberries is obviously more. Considering the typical slice size of a strawberry tart in Switzerland and the visible volume, a slice this size would weigh around 120-150 grams in total. Focusing only on the tarte aux fraises as the entire portion (since the tart is the only food item), the estimate is near 135 grams given the visible size and density of cream and crust.\",\n  \"tarte aux fraises\": 135\n}",

Given the plate's visible contents and typical usage of linseed oil as a dressing or finishing oil, a realistic portion would be around 10 to 15 grams (approximately 1 tablespoon). Since the oil does not appear in a separate container or as a visible quantity on the plate and is probably incorporated into the other items, estimating the weight at the midpoint of this range, 12 grams, is reasonable and consistent with typical Swiss portion sizes for oils used in a meal of this type.\",\n  \"huile de lin\": 12\n}",

The slice appears to be a standard serving size from a typical tart of about 24-26 cm diameter. The crust thickness and the rhubarb topping are visible, and the rhubarb pieces are chunky but not densely packed. Swiss portion sizes for a fruit tart slice typically range from 120 to 160 grams depending on thickness and topping density. Considering the moderate amount of rhubarb and the visible crust, a plausible range would be 130-150 grams.

Bell peppers have a relatively low density and weigh less than denser vegetables. Given the visible quantity and typical thickness, the poivron portion appears to be around 70 to 90 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes for cooked or sliced vegetables which are approximately 150-175 grams per serving, and this being roughly half or a bit less of a full serving, an estimate near the middle of 80 grams is reasonable and fits the visible amount.\",\n  \"poivron\": 80\n}",

The size of the bowl relative to the yogurt container and the wooden table surface suggests a portion size typical for Swiss serving sizes. Muesli portions are generally around 30 to 50 grams for a single serving, considering the light and airy nature of the clusters.

The tomato pieces roughly correspond to the content of about 2 medium tomatoes. A medium tomato typically weighs around 120-150 grams. Considering that this is a Swiss portion and that the tomatoes are cut into thick wedges, the total weight of the tomatoes on the plate is likely between 220 and 280 grams.

Maréchal is a semi-hard cheese, dense and relatively heavy for its volume. There are about five small cubes of maréchal cheese visible on the plate. Each cube looks roughly 1.5-2cm per side. A 2cm cube of semi-hard cheese weighs approximately 20-25 grams. Since these cubes are relatively small and there are five pieces, a reasonable weight range is about 80-120 grams. Given the visible size and number of cubes, I estimate the total maréchal cheese portion to be about 100 grams, which aligns well with a typical Swiss cheese portion size served in salads.\",\n  \"maréchal\": 100\n}",

Sprouts have a low density and typically weigh very little even in a volume that looks significant. Based on their size relative to the cherry tomatoes (each about 15-20 grams) and the falafels (weighing about 20-25 grams each), the pile of sprouts is estimated at roughly 40-60 grams.

This type of yogurt container is common in Switzerland and typically holds around 125 grams of yogurt. The yogurt appears to be unaltered and full, with no visible spoon marks or quantity removed. Given the standard portion size for single-serve plain yogurt containers, and the visual confirmation of filling, the weight is likely close to this standard. The neighboring apple provides a size and scale reference, confirming the container's typical small size.

Comparing the volume to the whole container and to the millet patties on the right, the zucchini and onion mix looks like about one medium-sized serving of cooked vegetables. Following Swiss portion size references, cooked vegetables typically weigh in the range of 150-175 grams per serving.

Each galette looks roughly shaped, about 5-6 cm in length and about 2-3 cm thick, with visible grains and beans giving substantial density. Considering their size and the grain/legume base, each galette likely weighs around 30-40 grams. With six galettes present, the total weight would be between 180 and 240 grams. Swiss portions for homemade vegetable patties of this type generally fall in this range. A midpoint estimate at 210 grams is reasonable, given the visual volume and compactness compared to the container size and the adjacent vegetables. This estimate excludes the courgette and onion portion and focuses strictly on the galettes.\",\n  \"galettes millet haricots noirs maïs\": 210\n}",

The pasta is fusilli, partially covered with a tomato-based sauce and a generous amount of grated Parmesan. The portion appears to fill roughly one third of the container's base area, and from the visible depth and compactness, it looks like a typical Swiss portion size. Considering cooked pasta typically weighs between 120-150 grams per serving in Switzerland and accounting for the moderate sauce and cheese on top, this portion seems to be near the upper middle of that range. Other items like grilled chicken and green beans in the container provide scale and confirm this is a single meal portion. Therefore, estimating a weight range between 130-150 grams is reasonable, and selecting a midpoint of 140 grams is appropriate for this pasta portion.\",\n  \"pâtes\": 140\n}",

The portion size is quite small relative to the risotto next to it. Given the relatively low density of leafy salad and the visible amount covering a small area of the plate with a single folded leaf and some mixed contents, the weight is likely less than a full vegetable serving. Swiss portion sizes for cooked vegetables or salads are typically around 150-175g for a full serving, but this is clearly a small side portion. Estimating the salad portion visually, I set a plausible range of about 30-50 grams, leaning towards the midpoint around 40 grams considering its compactness and visible volume. This is consistent with the size of the plate and the relative proportions to the risotto. Therefore, the estimated weight of the salade is about 40 grams.\",\n  \"salade\": 40\n}",

Considering the density and typical moisture content of cooked carrots and leeks, the vegetables have moderate volume but are less dense than meat or rice. Swiss typical cooked vegetable portions range between 150 and 175 grams. Given the amount visible, which is a moderate serving but not overly piled or deep, an estimated weight range would be 140 to 170 grams. Placing the estimation near the midpoint considering some loss of volume due to cooking, I estimate the sautéed vegetables weigh approximately 155 grams.\",\n  \"légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)\": 155\n}",

Considering the size of the plate and the proportion of eggs relative to the other foods (gnocchi and cauliflower), this looks like a single Swiss portion of scrambled eggs. A typical Swiss portion of eggs (cooked) weighs around 100-120 grams. Given this portion is neither very small nor excess, and taking into account moisture loss during cooking but also the fluffiness of scrambled eggs, an estimated weight range is 90-110 grams. Centered in this range, a reasonable estimate would be 100 grams.

The image shows a black bowl with spaghetti topped with some pesto and sprinkled with gruyère. The spaghetti are cooked and form a moderately sized portion, typical for a single Swiss serving. Swiss portion sizes for cooked pasta generally range from 120 to 150 grams. Considering the volume of spaghetti visible, which is not heaped excessively but enough to fill the bowl moderately, it fits well within this typical serving range. There are no unusually large or small portions visible, and the presence of pesto and cheese does not impact the pasta weight itself. Therefore, I estimate the spaghetti weight to be roughly the midpoint of the typical Swiss portion size range, approximately 135 grams.\",\n  \"spaghetti\": 135\n}",

Swiss bread slice weights commonly range between 40 to 60 grams per slice depending on thickness and density. Given the visible slice thickness and density of the bread in the image, it's appropriate to estimate each slice around 45-55 grams. Since there are two slices visible (one with cheese and cornichons and one with mayonnaise), but the target item is 'pain bis' which includes both slices, the total weight is around 90-110 grams.

The waffle is about the size of a standard homemade or store-bought portion, roughly 10 x 7 cm in surface area and about 1.5 to 2 cm thick, which is typical for waffles. Given the dessert-like, relatively light and fluffy texture of waffles, a standard Swiss portion weight for such a waffle is usually around 60-80 grams. Since this waffle doesn't appear overly thick or thin and is a single piece, the estimated weight falls in this range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this gaufre at around 70 grams, balancing between 60 and 80 grams for plausibility.\",\n  \"gaufre\": 70\n}",

Given Swiss portion norms, a typical cooked sauce portion accompanying pasta falls around 100-140 grams. Visually, this portion is neither excessively thin nor piled very thickly, suggesting a moderate amount. Considering the size of the plate and the proportion of sauce to pasta, an estimated range of 110-130 grams appears plausible. The midpoint would be approximately 120 grams, which aligns well with typical Swiss servings of meat sauce as a single portion.

Each slice of bread appears to be from a typical Swiss baguette-style loaf, approximately 1 to 1.5 cm thick, and roughly 10-12 cm long. A typical slice of this type of bread weighs around 40-50 grams in Swiss portion sizes. Given there are two slices visible, each weighing approximately 45 grams on average, the total weight of bread on the plate should be close to 90 grams. The volume and thickness appear consistent with this range and there is no visible indication of unusually thick or thin slices.

Assuming an average of about 16 grams per 10 blueberries, 15-20 blueberries would weigh roughly 24-32 grams total. Considering some may be partially hidden or embedded, a plausible range would be about 20-35 grams.

The crème de marrons spread is visibly applied in a thin to moderate layer covering most of the bread's surface. Chestnut cream is a dense, moist spread, but given the thin layer and partial coverage, the quantity should be modest. The visible volume corresponds roughly to about 20-30g of cream. Based on these observations and typical portion sizes, the amount of crème de marrons on this slice of bread is likely in the range of 20-30 grams.

A single slice of standard whole wheat or multigrain bread toast usually weighs around 30 grams. Since there are two slices, the total weight of the toast would be about 60 grams. The fromage frais spread on each slice appears to be light and unevenly spread, covering the surface but thinly applied. Typically, a thin layer of fromage frais on toast can be estimated around 15 grams per slice. For two slices, this totals about 30 grams of fromage frais. Considering Swiss portions tend to be slightly smaller, 12-15 grams per slice of fromage frais on toast is plausible. So the total toasted bread weight is about 60 grams, but since the target is 'toast' only (not the fromage frais), my estimate is 60 grams for the toast (the bread).
