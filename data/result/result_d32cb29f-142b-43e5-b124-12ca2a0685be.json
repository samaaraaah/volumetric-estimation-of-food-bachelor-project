The image shows a small blue bowl held in a person's hand above a knee, containing a light beige creamy pudding identified as crème caramel. From the size of the hand and knee, the bowl appears small, likely a dessert-sized portion. The crème caramel covers the bottom of the bowl in a shallow layer with some texture lumps visible, probably from caramel or custard solidification. Typical portions of crème caramel in such small bowls range from about 100 to 150 grams. Given the relatively thin, but full coverage in the small bowl, the volume looks closer to the lower-medium range of usual dessert portions. Considering the density of crème caramel is similar to custard (close to that of water but slightly denser), the weight is roughly equivalent to the volume in milliliters. I estimate a range of 110 to 140 grams as plausible, and selecting a medium value within that range leads to about 125 grams.\",\n  \"crème caramel\": 125\n}",

The portion is a rectangular slice approximately 10 cm by 7 cm, with moderate thickness including the biscuit and creamy layers. The biscuit layer is dense and moist from fruit juices, while the creamy top is thick and smooth, and the few berries on top add slight weight. Considering the size and density, I estimate the weight to be in the range of 120-160 grams given the creamy, moist components that add weight beyond a dry biscuit cake slice. The portion is medium-sized, not very thin or overly thick, so choosing a midpoint value is logical. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this 'délice des dieux' slice to be approximately 140 grams.\",\n  \"délice des dieux (biscuit, fruits rouges, séré+mascarpone)\": 140\n}",

The waffles appear to be about 7-8 cm each side, roughly cut from a larger waffle. Each piece looks to be about 1.5-2 cm thick. Sweet potato waffles are dense due to the tuber content but still lighter than meat. The portions here appear moderate, not very large but definitely not a bite-sized piece. Considering the size and density, each piece likely weighs about 40-45 grams. With four pieces in total, the whole waffle portion is approximately 160-180 grams. Thus, for the entire 'gaufre à la patate douce' portion on the plate, I estimate about 170 grams. This accounts purely for the waffles without the toppings.\",\n  \"gaufre à la patate douce\": 170\n}",

A whole medium tomato typically weighs around 120-150 grams, and these pieces appear to represent roughly half a tomato based on volume. Therefore, the total weight of the tomato pieces is likely around 60-80 grams. Considering the tomatoes' density, moisture content, and size of pieces, I estimate the weight of the tomatoes on the plate to be approximately 70 grams.\",\n  \"tomates\": 70\n}",

Given the density of the beans and sausages, and the moist but thick sauce, the chili has a substantial weight. The portion is not overly heaped but moderately piled, so depth is medium. Comparing to the pasta on the plate which looks like about 150 grams, the chili portion appears slightly larger in volume but denser. A reasonable internal weight range is between 220 grams and 280 grams.

The courgette and onions appear to be chopped into chunks and cooked, with visible moisture indicating softness and some water retention. The container size looks like a small meal prep portion container, roughly 12 by 12 cm and about 3-4 cm deep. The courgette and onions cover about half the container, and the amount fills this half to a moderate thickness, around 2.5-3 cm depth likely. Cooked courgettes and onions have moderate density due to their water content, but still retain some bulk. Given the size and volume, I estimate this portion roughly at around 150 to 180 grams.

The mashed potatoes are spread in a rectangular shape covering a significant part of the plate center, approximately 10 cm by 6 cm, with moderate thickness—likely about 2 to 3 cm. Mashed potatoes have a dense but slightly aerated texture. Using the plate diameter roughly as a scale of about 25-27 cm and comparing the size of the carrots and meat pieces, the mashed potatoes portion visually fits a medium serving. Considering typical density (about 0.9 g/cm3) and the portion volume estimation (roughly 10 cm x 6 cm x 2.5 cm = 150 cm3), the estimated weight for the purée de pdt is approximately 130-150 grams.

Multiplying 12 berries by an average weight of about 1.2 grams gives a range of 12-16 grams. Considering possible blueberries slightly hidden or partially seen but not counted, a plausible weight range would be 14-18 grams. The portion is medium-sized but the blueberries cover a small area on the porridge. I estimate the total weight of the blueberries as approximately 16 grams.\",\n  \"myrtilles\": 16\n}",

The image depicts a black plate holding two dessert portions: a tiramisu on the left and a forêt noir on the right. I focus on the tiramisu portion. It is a moderately sized slice with visible layers of soaked sponge and creamy mascarpone. The dimensions seem approximately 8 cm long, 4 cm wide, and about 3.5 cm high. This corresponds to a roughly rectangular slice. Considering the density of tiramisu, which is creamy yet soft, the weight per volume will be relatively dense but less than solid cake. A typical tiramisu of this size usually weighs between 120 and 160 grams. Given the moistness and some slight compression visible, I estimate the tiramisu slice shown to be around 140 grams. This is consistent with the nearby forêt noir portion which appears somewhat similar in mass on the plate, supporting the plausibility of this estimate.\",\n  \"tiramisu\": 140\n}",

Comparing the banana to the visible texture and size of the surface beneath it, it appears to be about 10 cm in length. A medium banana typically weighs between 120 to 150 grams with the peel. Since this banana is peeled and about half the size of a whole medium banana, the weight is likely less, around 60 to 80 grams. Considering some moisture loss and the visible density, I estimate this peeled banana piece to weigh about 70 grams.\",\n  \"banane\": 70\n}",

The image shows a plate of pâtes carbonara topped with a noticeable pile of grated gruyère cheese. The pasta portion is moderate, spread out enough to cover a small-to-medium plate area. The pasta pieces appear cooked al dente with sauce and bacon bits, typical for carbonara, and the visible volume suggests a reasonable portion size. The grated gruyère cheese on top looks like a generous sprinkle, roughly the volume of a small handful of cheese granules. Considering that cooked pasta weighs less than it appears due to water content but is dense when sauced, the pasta sauce and bacon contribute density as well. A small to medium cooked pasta portion is usually around 150-200 grams without cheese. The grated gruyère cheese volume estimated visually corresponds to about 20-30 grams. Therefore, for the pâtes carbonara portion alone (excluding the cheese), the estimated weight is about 170 grams, with a plausible range of 150-190 grams. This makes sense relative to the plate size, visible pasta quantity, and cheese topping volume. I thus estimate the weight of the pâtes carbonara to be 170 grams.\",\n  \"pâtes carbonara\": 170\n}",

Given its diameter relative to the fork and plate, it measures approximately 20-22 cm across, which is common for such wraps. Galette wraps of this size generally weigh between 60-70 grams. Since this wrap shows no visible signs of being thickened, folded, or doubled, and appears similar to typical weights recorded for Swiss galette wraps, I estimate the weight around the middle of the typical range at 65 grams.\",\n  \"galette wraps\": 65\n}",

There are about seven medium-sized strawberry halves visible, and some red currants embedded in the cream. The strawberries are relatively dense but not very heavy individually; a medium strawberry half weighs about 10-12 grams, thus the seven halves weigh roughly 70-85 grams in total. The creamy filling below appears substantial and covers the entire crust slice, which itself is quite thin but extends around the base. The crust and cream can be estimated at around 60-80 grams combined for this piece, given its thickness and volume compared to the strawberries. Adding these components together, the portion looks like a medium-sized slice typically weighing between 130 and 165 grams.

The butter portions appear thinly spread, likely about 5-8 grams. The chestnut cream layer is also moderately thin but covers most of the bread, suggesting around 15-20 grams. Combining these components, the total weight of the tartine with chestnut cream and butter is approximately between 45 and 55 grams.

The piece is about the length of the smaller croissant on the plate and appears to be about 12-14 cm long, roughly 2-3 cm wide and 1.5-2 cm thick. Gruyère is a dense cheese, so even a small piece can weigh noticeably. Considering typical density and size for such a cut of cheese, the weight is likely between 60 and 90 grams. The size looks medium for a cheese portion, leaning towards the average serving size. Therefore, a reasoned estimate of the weight of this bout de gruyère is approximately 75 grams.\",\n  \"bout de gruyère\": 75\n}",

Considering a normal serving of sauce with roast in a Swiss context, the sauce portion likely weighs between 40 and 60 grams. Given the visible volume and typical density of cooked onion sauce, and the fact that it is spread mostly around the meat and partly on the plate, the estimated weight is about 50 grams.

The kidney beans appear to be cooked and loosely piled occupying roughly one quarter of the plate, and each bean is plump and visible. Considering standard serving sizes, a typical portion of cooked kidney beans is dense and weighs about 120-150 grams for a moderate portion. Given the amount visible here, the beans appear to be a medium portion, with about 60-80 individual beans visible. After visual assessment, a reasonable range would be 110-140 grams.

A standard freshly baked croissant au chocolat from a European bakery typically weighs between 70 and 90 grams due to the layered buttery dough and chocolate filling. Given that this croissant is mostly intact, medium size, and dense with nuts and chocolate, the weight estimate should be around 80 grams.

Based on the smooth surface and size compared to the olives (which are about 3-4 cm each), the mozzarella ball is roughly the size of a typical 100g mozzarella ball often sold in Swiss markets. The thickness and height confirm it is not a large portion like 125g or 150g, nor is it a tiny piece. A reasonable weight range would be 90-110 grams.

The tuna is in small to medium flakes and pieces mixed evenly throughout the salad. The container appears to be a medium-sized meal prep container, about 15 cm wide and roughly 6-7 cm deep. Considering the volume occupied by the tuna relative to the couscous and cucumber pieces, the tuna likely accounts for about one fifth to one quarter of the total mixture by weight. Tuna is dense, so even these flakes contribute significantly to the weight. Given that cooked couscous weighs about 120-130 g per cup and the container seems to hold about 2 cups of the salad mixture total (roughly 250-270 g total), the tuna portion could be estimated reasonably around 50-70 grams.

Considering a typical slice of Swiss semi-hard cheese like Emmental or Gruyère, a thin finger-sized slice typically weighs around 8-12 grams. Given the number of strips and their thinness, the total cheese on this sandwich looks like a small to medium portion. I estimate the total cheese weight to be between 45g and 60g.

Considering the volume spread and the typical density of fresh kiwi (high water content but solid texture), the total amount of kiwi corresponds to about one medium kiwi fruit. A medium kiwi generally weighs between 70 and 90 grams when peeled and cut. Since this appears to be nearly one full kiwi's worth of pieces, a reasonable estimated range would be 70-90 grams.
