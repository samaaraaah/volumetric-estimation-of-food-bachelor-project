The 'salade de pâtes' is the serving of pasta salad on the bottom left portion of the plate. The salad appears to be made with short, spiral pasta (likely cooked), some visible vegetables (corn, green bell pepper, red pepper), and a creamy dressing. Evaluating the visible quantity, it covers a modest section of the plate and forms a small mound with moderate depth. For reference, a typical Swiss portion of cooked pasta is 120-150g, but for a side salad, the weight is usually less. Visually, this looks like about 1/3 to 1/2 of a main portion, especially considering other items on the plate (filet de canard, sausage, carrot salad), so it is not the main dish. Estimating the plausible range: the mound of salad likely weighs between 55 and 80 grams. The volume appears slightly above 1/3 cup, which aligns with about 65g for a pasta salad side serving. Therefore, the most plausible estimate is 68 grams.\",\n  \"salade de pâtes\": 68\n}",

Estimating by the typical Swiss slice size and comparing with the plate, the slice seems moderately sized—not a large restaurant portion, but not tiny. A standard slice of fruit tart (1/8 of a 24cm tart) weighs around 120-160g depending on the density of the fruit, cream, and crust. Here, the slice is fairly thick and loaded with strawberries, which increases the weight but is balanced by the lightness of the cream. Visually, the strawberry amount appears to be about 55-65g, the filling around 50-60g, and the base around 30-40g. So a plausible total range is 130-165g.

Given that this is a composed bowl often associated with healthy/vegan eating, such oils are usually added in small quantities, typically as a drizzle over the vegetables, grains, or overall bowl. Standard Swiss drizzles for finishing oil are about 1 to 2 teaspoons per portion. One teaspoon of oil is approximately 4-5 ml, and a Swiss portion as a dressing is nearly always about 1–2 teaspoons (so 4–10 ml). The oil is not visibly pooling or creating sheen on the veggies, which suggests a light hand. Estimating on the lower end due to the absence of evidence of pooling: a plausible range is 4-8g, as oil (density ~0.92g/ml) is quite light but caloric.

The slice has visible fruit pieces and a firm crust, indicating some density but also typical tart airiness. Comparing the slice size to the knife and fork, it seems a bit larger than a typical Swiss dessert portion, but not by much. For tarts, a standard portion is usually 110–140g per slice for fruit tarts in Switzerland. This slice looks slightly above average in terms of area and thickness. Estimating a plausible range of 120–150g, the most reasonable mid-value based on visible thickness and filling is about 135 grams.

A medium Swiss bell pepper weighs about 150-180g whole (with seeds), but half (prepared and sliced) is usually 60-80g. The strips cover an area similar to the chicken pieces next to them but are thinner and less dense. Estimating visually, there's likely 11-14 thin strips, probably corresponding to half or slightly less than half a pepper after trimming. Internal minimum-maximum range: 40g (if it's less than half, very thin) to 70g (if it's a dense half). The visual fullness places it slightly above the middle, so I estimate around 55g.

For plain or crunchy muesli, typical density is about 35-40g per 100ml. If the bowl holds around 125 ml and is almost full (but with cluster voids), a realistic minimum is about 40g, and a plausible max for packing like this is about 60g. The weight likely sits near the middle of this range, as the muesli is in chunky clusters but does not appear super densely compacted. Therefore, the best estimate is 50 grams.

Each tomato wedge appears typical in size for medium salad tomatoes. Comparing to the surrounding utensils for scale, the plate is not enormous but is quite full. A typical medium tomato weighs 110-130g, and here I can see the equivalent of about 4-5 whole tomatoes when accounting for overlap and layering. This results in a tomato total between 440g (4 x 110) and 650g (5 x 130). Some space is taken up by the seeds and greens but mostly this is tomato. For a typical large Swiss-style salad, a serving is often 250-400g, but this portion is distinctly larger, likely intended as a main dish or for sharing.

Counting the visible pieces, there are about six to seven cubes, each about 1 to 1.5 cm per side, suggesting they are cut from a block and are not sliced thinly. A standard cheese cube of this size weighs about 5-7 grams due to the density of hard cheese. With 7 cubes, that gives a range of 35g (5g x 7) to 49g (7g x 7), but these pieces are not large and look uniform and moderately sized. Estimating more closely, the total visible weight for the Maréchal cheese cubes is likely around 40 grams, given the visual density, context as a salad topping, and the Swiss tendency for modest cheese portions in salads.

Judging by the visual density, the sprouts seem somewhat sparse, forming a thin layer rather than a thick, packed portion. The majority lie centrally, with some minor spread to the left and top of the bowl. For context, the bowl is also filled with a generous layer of fresh spinach and several falafels—for size comparison, the falafels likely weigh around 25 g each. The sprouts appear to occupy an area no larger than one small handful, and visually seem airy and very light, not densely packed. When compared to a standard Swiss portion (side portion on a salad typically 10–20 g, while a dense salad mix might be up to 30 g), this portion is on the milder side. My internal range is 11–18 grams, as the sprouts barely cover the greens, and would likely weigh less than a typical small apple wedge but more than just a few decorative strands.

The fullness of the cup and the visible packaging size are consistent with a 125g standard serving, which is the most common for plain yogurt. The yogurt appears to be full and unaltered, and there is no sign that any has been removed. The container is not especially short or squat, so 100g would look visibly smaller in this form factor.

The container appears to be a standard meal prep box (approx. 13x13 cm), and the vegetables fill about half its volume, with a loose, chunky texture. Courgette and onions lose considerable water when cooked, which reduces visual density, but here the mixture is not overly watery, and the vegetable pieces are still visibly chunky, not collapsed. Estimating the height of the layer, it looks like a moderate but not thick portion, around 1–1.5 cm deep. For cooked vegetables, a full serving for a meal is typically 200–300g, but the amount here, filling only half of a medium meal box, would plausibly weigh less. Based on visual assessment, the volume likely translates to a weight between 110g (minimum for sparse cooked vegetables) and 160g (if it is more packed). The box provides useful scale anchoring.

Each galette looks to be roughly 4-5 cm in diameter and about 1.5 cm thick. Based on visual density, ingredients (millet, black beans, corn), and their crumbly appearance, each likely weighs 25-30 grams. Four patties would thus be about 100-120 grams. Given this and comparing with the left-hand courgette/onion portion (which appears larger and more watery), the weight range for all patties would plausibly be 90-120g, midpoint around 105g.

The pasta is fusilli, tightly packed and occupying about half of the main compartment. Given the depth of the tray, it appears to be a full but not heaping serving, suggesting a moderate to small Swiss portion. Relative to the chicken strips and green beans, the pasta takes up a dominant share of the tray, but is not mounded high. Swiss cooked pasta portions are typically around 120-150g, but since this serving looks substantial (but not excessive), and considering the visible density (not spread thin, not packed tightly), I estimate the plausible range to be 120g (minimum, if it’s shallower) to 160g (if the tray is filled deeper).

Estimating visually, the approximate minimum is 55g (if thinnest) and maximum about 90g (if denser than appears), but the most likely value for this visible serving is about 72g.

For Swiss grains like cooked spelt, typical portions are similar to rice (about 100-130g per serving), but this appearance closely resembles generous side portions sometimes found in meal preps. Given the visual comparison with the scrambled eggs and aubergine, both of which look substantial and knowing that cooked spelt is well hydrated and thus relatively dense, we can estimate the volume. The visible portion of spelt here fills about a third of the 700-900 ml standard prep box (likely 800 ml based on the glass container size), giving around 250-300ml by volume. At approximately 1g per 1ml for cooked spelt, this would yield 250-300g, but the spelt section isn't packed to maximum density and leaves some air space. A reasonable minimum-maximum would be 130g (if shallow and less dense) up to 190g (if densely packed). The most plausible weight, centered between those, is about 160g.

In Swiss and European breakfast bowls like this, chia is usually added in modest amounts because a little goes a long way (they absorb a lot of liquid and expand). Standard home recipes for a bowl of this sort typically use 1 to 2 teaspoons (about 5–10g) of chia seeds per bowl.

The image shows a standard small cardboard punnet filled with cherry tomatoes ('tomates cerises'), some still attached to the vine. Each tomato appears to be normal sized, about 20-25g each per Swiss reference. I count approximately 20 cherry tomatoes in the punnet. Multiplying 20 tomatoes by an average of 22g gives about 440g. Punnets sold in Switzerland for cherry tomatoes are most commonly 250g or 500g, but this punnet looks nearly fully filled and more in line with a 500g size when accounting for gaps and vine weight (the vine itself may add 10-15g, but it's included visually in the produce sold as 'tomates cerises'). For a plausible range, I'd estimate between 410g (if the tomatoes are on the smaller side and gaps) to 480g (larger, tightly packed).

One single stick of Kinder Bueno (not the full pack, just one segregation) typically weighs 21.5 grams according to Swiss and European packaging. The size, visible thickness, and shape all match this standard size, and only one stick is present.

Blevita is a well-known Swiss cracker brand, and these appear to be the standard individually portioned crackers (not mini or broken pieces). The typical weight for a single Blevita cracker of this type is 6 grams, as confirmed by product packaging on Swiss market. Since all four crackers are fully visible and appear intact, the total weight is 6g x 4 = 24g. Typical Blevita portion packs are 3 or 4 biscuits, so this fits as a plausible serving.

The molasses is applied on the top slice, mixed with butter. Visually, the molasses covers much of the slice but in a thin, patchy layer. For such light and sticky spreads, an average serving is 7–12 grams per slice when used sparingly. Here, the amount is on the lighter side, as it’s only a thin, uneven layer, not fully covering or thick. Taking into account the spread density, visible coverage, and partial blending with butter, my plausible range is 6–10 grams.

Judging from the plate size and comparing the salad to the risotto portion, the salad occupies roughly one third of the plate and is somewhat voluminous but clearly not densely packed. The salad leaves appear airy and not tamped down. Based on Swiss portion references, a plated portion of leafy salad usually ranges from 70g (small) up to 150g (generous). In this image, the salad mound looks moderate and not tightly packed; it seems to be a standard accompaniment, not a meal-sized bowl. Using both the visible volume and the plate’s relative size, a realistic range would be 75-110g, with the visible salad closer to the lower-middle of that range as it's not overflowing or exceedingly stacked up.

These typically weigh between 23 and 25 grams per bar according to packaging information. The entire bar is visible above the wrapper and not broken, indicating the full portion. Using the standard product reference for this well-known Swiss snack and given that the visual size matches the typical 'branche,' I estimate the weight as 25 grams, which sits at the highest end of the plausible range (23-25g), to avoid underestimation.\",\n  \"branche de chocolat\": 25\n}",

The image shows a white plate with four large pizza slices topped with mushrooms (champignons), olives, and courgettes. The slices appear to form a substantial but incomplete pizza (roughly half a typical Swiss whole pizza, probably 8 slices in total if whole). Visually, the crust and toppings appear of regular thickness (not deep-dish), and the pizza style is typical of thin to regular European pizzas. A standard Swiss pizza (thin crust, 32 cm diameter) typically weighs between 350-400g when whole, depending on toppings, with each slice then averaging about 45-50g for an 8-slice pizza. Here, the four slices take up over half the plate and look consistent with this sizing, but the slices are not perfectly uniform—one is somewhat larger and one slightly smaller, suggesting the weight is closer to half of a medium pizza. I estimate the total visible portion at around 190-225g, given the apparent density of cheese, vegetables, crust, and toppings. My plausible range is therefore 190g (if the slices are thinner/lighter) to 225g (if they are thicker/doughier or have more toppings).

Visually, the salad covers about a third to almost half of the plate, consisting of a mix of leafy greens (lettuce), visible strips of carrot, and some diced avocado. The dressing with oil and vinegar adds negligible mass, so we focus mainly on the vegetables. Swiss portion sizes for salad typically range from 250 to 400g for a full main course, but here, the portion is moderate as it shares the plate with two eggs and a large piece of bread, indicating it is a side salad. The salad appears loose and airy, not densely packed: the leafy greens are voluminous but light, and though there are visible carrot strips and bits of avocado, the majority by volume is lettuce. Considering the visible depth and spread across the plate, I estimate the plausible range is 80g at minimum (if very loose) to 140g at maximum (if the volume is deceptive), with a midpoint of about 110g.

The layer is a single, loose layer with some overlap, not heavily piled. Judging by the size of the lid (roughly 17x12 cm based on standard lunchbox lids), the amount of kohlrabi could cover about half to three-quarters of a whole medium kohlrabi. A whole medium kohlrabi, peeled, weighs approximately 220-250g. Visually, the pieces likely sum to about 120-150g (taking into account visible volume and density). For calibration, raw kohlrabi is quite dense, similar to apple or potato in weight. The plausible range is about 120g (minimum) to 160g (maximum), with a midpoint estimate of about 140g.

Visually, the spinach covers the entire bottom of the bowl, with leaves both underneath and intertwined with other salad ingredients. The volume appears to be moderate—not overly packed, but clearly present in sufficient quantity for a salad base. For leafy greens like spinach, weight is much less than volume: a large handful is generally about 30g. Here, there looks to be about 2-2.5 large handfuls (covering the full bowl with a loose but not sparse layer), indicating a total between 55 and 80g. Typical Swiss salad portions are 40-60g for one handful, but here the volume (considering the visible distribution and some leaves underneath the toppings) suggests slightly more than a small salad, but not a heaping amount.
