    "99": "{\n\t\"reasoning\": \"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The tomme de savoie is located in the bottom center of the plate. It is a wedge-shaped piece of cheese with a creamy white interior and a slightly darker rind. Based on its size relative to the other cheeses and the baguette slice, it appears to be a small portion. The wedge is approximately 5 cm long, 3 cm wide at the base, and about 1 cm thick. Tomme de savoie is a semi-hard cheese, so it is denser than soft cheeses like brie. Considering its dimensions and density, I estimate the weight of this piece to be around 25 grams.\",\n\t\"tomme de savoie\": 25\n}"
