The specified food item is 'salade (salade verte, carottes, avocat, 1cs huile d'olive, 1 cs vinaigre)'. In the image, the salad is clearly visible on the right side of the plate. It consists of lettuce (salade verte), shredded carrots, and small pieces of avocado, with a dressing of olive oil and vinegar. The salad appears to be a medium portion, covering a significant part of the plate but not piled very high. Lettuce is low in density, while carrots and avocado add some weight. The dressing (1 tablespoon each of olive oil and vinegar) also contributes slightly to the weight. Based on the visual volume and typical densities of these ingredients, I estimate the total weight of the salad to be approximately 150 grams.\",\n\t\"salade (salade verte, carottes, avocat, 1cs huile d'olive, 1 cs vinaigre)\": 150\n}",
    "98": "{\n\t\"reasoning\": \"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plastic container with raw kohlrabi ('colrave crue') cut into medium-sized slices. The slices are relatively thick and appear to be densely packed on the plate. Based on the size of the container and the volume of the kohlrabi slices, I estimate the total weight of the kohlrabi to be approximately 200 grams. This estimation considers the density of raw kohlrabi and the visible portion size.\",\n\t\"colrave crue\": 200\n}",
    "99": "{\n\t\"reasoning\": \"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'épinards frais' (fresh spinach). In the image, the spinach is spread across the bottom of the bowl and forms the base of the salad. The leaves are fresh, raw, and not tightly packed, which means they have a low density. Based on the visible volume of spinach in the bowl, it appears to be approximately 2-3 handfuls of loose leaves. A typical handful of fresh spinach weighs around 20-30 grams. Given the amount visible, I estimate the total weight of the spinach to be around 60 grams.\",\n\t\"épinards frais\": 60\n}"
