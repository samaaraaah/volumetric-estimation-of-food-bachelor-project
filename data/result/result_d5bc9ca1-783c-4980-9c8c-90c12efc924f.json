The fresh spinach (épinards frais) is visible as the base layer of the salad, covering the bottom of the bowl. The leaves are whole and not chopped, and they appear to be loosely packed. Based on the size of the bowl and the visible volume of spinach, I estimate that there are approximately 50-70 grams of fresh spinach. Fresh spinach is lightweight and takes up significant volume, so I will estimate the weight at the lower end of this range to account for the loose packing.\",\n\t\"épinards frais\": 60\n}"
