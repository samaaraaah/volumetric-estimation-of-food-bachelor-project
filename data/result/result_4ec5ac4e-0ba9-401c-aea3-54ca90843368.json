Visually, it is located at the bottom left section of the plate and consists of pasta spirals mixed with visible pieces of vegetables such as corn, cucumber, and tomato. Regarding volume, the portion of pasta salad occupies roughly a third of the plate's diameter and appears to be a moderate scoop with some height but not piled very high. The plate is a standard dinner plate (about 25-27 cm diameter) giving scale. Given the pasta shapes and some vegetables, density is moderate, less than plain cooked pasta for an equal volume because of the vegetables and dressing likely present. A typical Swiss portion of pasta salad in such serving size would be approximately 120-160 grams. Considering this, a weight estimate near the middle of this range is reasonable. After a plausibility check, 140 grams is a balanced estimate that fits the visible volume and density cues.\",\n  \"salade de pâtes\": 140\n}",

The specified food item is 'tarte aux fraises,' visible in the image as a slice of strawberry tart on a plate. The tart slice includes a base (likely a pastry crust), a creamy filling, and a generous topping of whole and halved strawberries, plus some red currants. The plate's diameter can be roughly estimated around 20-22 cm based on typical dish sizes, and the tart slice occupies about one-sixth to one-eighth of a standard 20 cm tart. The crust thickness is thin but solid, and the cream layer appears moderately thick. The strawberries, being dense and fresh, add weight. Strawberries typically weigh around 12-15 grams each. There are approximately 6 visible strawberries on top, plus some red currants. The creamy layer likely weighs similarly or a bit more. Taking the crust, filling, and fruit into consideration, the weight range is plausibly between 120 grams (if lighter on cream) and 160 grams (if cream and fruits denser). A midpoint estimate is about 140 grams. This aligns with a typical Swiss-sized slice of strawberry tart of this appearance and volume.\",\n  \"tarte aux fraises\": 140\n}",

Typically, oil portions are small and not visually prominent in mixed dishes since they are liquid and often used as dressing or cooking medium. In the image, the oil is not distinctly visible as a separate entity, suggesting it is likely mixed in with other foods or lightly drizzled. Given the size of the plate and the other portions, a reasonable estimate for linseed oil used in a meal like this would be about 1 tablespoon (roughly 15 ml). The density of linseed oil is close to 0.93 g/ml, so 15 ml corresponds to approximately 14 grams. A plausible range is 10-20 grams considering possible minimal drizzling or mixing in. Therefore, the final estimate is 14 grams for huile de lin.\",\n  \"huile de lin\": 14\n}",

The tart slice is relatively thin, approximately 1.5 to 2 cm thick, with visible rhubarb chunks on top and a pastry base. Rhubarb is a low-density vegetable, but the tart has added custard or similar, increasing density slightly. Typical rhubarb tart slices range from 100 to 150 grams for this size slice. Given the size, thickness, and the apparent density of the filling and crust, the plausible weight range is 110 to 140 grams.

The target food item is 'poivron' (bell pepper), which is the red sliced strips on the plate. Visually, the poivron portion appears to be about one small bell pepper sliced into thin strips, arranged neatly on the plate. Compared to the pieces of chicken and tomato slices nearby, the poivron occupies a modest area but with moderate thickness. A small bell pepper typically weighs about 100 to 150 grams whole. Given this is sliced and some loss from trimming is likely, the visible portion corresponds to approximately two-thirds to three-quarters of a small bell pepper. Therefore, I estimate the poivron weight to be in the range of 65 to 110 grams. The midpoint would be around 85 grams. This makes sense given the portion size relative to other food items and the plate. Hence, 85 grams is a reasonable and plausible estimate.\",\n  \"poivron\": 85\n}",

Given the loose structure and typical density of muesli granola clusters, the volume is approximately 250 to 300 ml. Considering an average density of around 0.5 to 0.6 grams per ml for chunky muesli, this yields a weight range of 125 to 180 grams. Selecting a value near the middle of this range for accuracy, I estimate the muesli weighs about 150 grams.

The tomato slices are thick and numerous, covering almost the whole plate surface with some overlapping but not piled high, suggesting a relatively flat layer about 1.5–2 cm thick. Considering a medium tomato weighs approximately 120–150 grams, and visually estimating about 3 to 4 medium tomatoes sliced and arranged here, the total quantity should be around 400 to 600 grams. Accounting for the density and moisture of tomatoes, which are quite dense and juicy, and the coverage on the plate, a plausible weight range is 450–550 grams.

Cheese is dense, approximately 1 gram per cm³. The total volume for 4 cheese cubes, estimated at about 1.5x1.5x1.5 cm each, is roughly 4 x 3.375 cm³ = 13.5 cm³. This corresponds to about 13 to 15 grams of cheese. Considering some margin for slight variation in cube size and density, a plausible weight range is 12 to 18 grams.

Given their roughly 7-8 cm spread and sparse layering, the volume corresponds to about a handful of sprouts typically weighed around 20-40 grams. Considering the visual density and the area covered, a plausible weight range is between 25 and 40 grams. The midpoint at about 32 grams fits well with their observed mass relative to the size of cherry tomatoes and spinach leaves on the plate.

From the image, the yogurt is in a small plastic container commonly used for individual yogurt portions in Switzerland and Europe. Such standard single-serve yogurt containers typically hold about 125 grams. The yogurt appears nearly full without excessive air space. Therefore, the total weight of the yogurt content is close to the container's standard filling. Comparing with the apple next to it (which is about 75-100 grams), the yogurt container volume aligns with a typical 125g yogurt portion. The plausible range is from around 110 to 140 grams due to slight variability in fill level and container size, so the final estimate near the midpoint is 125 grams.\",\n  \"yaourt nature\": 125\n}",

The vegetables appear to be cooked and chopped into bite-sized pieces, spread loosely but visibly filling around half of the container's left side. The container is roughly 15 cm by 15 cm square. The vegetable portion does not look very dense, given the mix of courgettes and onions which have high water content and cook down to a soft texture, reducing volume and weight. Given the visible volume, depth (about 3-4 cm in the container), and typical density for cooked courgettes and onions, the weight could be estimated between 150 g and 220 g. A midpoint estimate around 185 g seems reasonable and plausible, considering the portion size and density observed. This also aligns well with the comparative size of the millet and bean patties on the right, which are denser but occupy a somewhat smaller visual volume.

These galettes are dense with millet, black beans, and corn, which all contribute to a somewhat compact but not very heavy texture. Each galette likely weighs roughly between 40 and 50 grams given their size and density. For five galettes, the total weight range would be around 200 to 250 grams. Given the visual fullness, the galettes appear to be packed but not overly thick or heavy. Thus, a reasonable estimate near the midpoint is about 225 grams. This estimate aligns well with the relative size of the container and the adjacent courgette and onion portion.

The pasta is visible on the right side of the metal container, cooked fusilli covered partially with a moderate amount of grated parmesan. The portion fills roughly half of the container's area. Using the chicken strips and green beans on the left as size references, the metal container seems to be a standard meal tray approximately 20x15 cm in size. The pasta layer looks to be about 2.5 cm thick, judging by the volume and the way it sits relative to other foods. Cooked pasta typically weighs around 130-150 grams per 100 ml volume. Given the estimated volume (~20 cm x 7.5 cm x 2.5 cm = ~375 cm³), and considering some space within pasta is air, the weight would be about 125-160 grams. Therefore, a reasonable range is 125-160 grams with a midpoint estimate near 140 grams. This fits the visible portion size well, aligning with Swiss meal portion norms.\",\n  \"pâtes\": 140\n}",

The salad portion appears to be small and consists mainly of leafy greens with some small bits of other vegetables or dressing. The size relative to the risotto and knife gives a good scale: the salad occupies a compact area roughly 6 cm by 4 cm, and the leaves are layered but not piled very thick—about 1 to 1.5 cm thick. Given that lettuce and similar greens have low density (about 0.2 to 0.3 g/cm³), the volume estimated is approximately 6 cm x 4 cm x 1.5 cm = 36 cm³. Multiplying by an average density of 0.25 g/cm³ results in about 9 grams. Considering slight dressing and small additional vegetables, it is reasonable to give a range of 8-12 grams. The midpoint would be around 10 grams. This is consistent with the small visible portion on the plate and the typical weight of such a salad amount. Therefore, the best estimate for the salad weight is 10 grams.\",\n  \"salade\": 10\n}",

Considering the density of cooked vegetables, which is approximately 0.7 to 0.9 g/cm³ due to water content and softness, the weight range would be around 37 to 47 grams. Given the visible quantity and considering some mixing with fish pieces, the final estimate near the midpoint would be 42 grams. This aligns well with the portion size on the plate, which is moderately sized but not dense or piled high.\",\n  \"légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)\": 42\n}",

Comparing to the gnocchi pieces on the right and the cauliflower florets on the bottom left, the eggs look like a moderately sized portion of about one large egg equivalent, broken up and cooked. A single large egg weighs approximately 50 grams before cooking, and scrambled eggs can lose a bit of water but remain roughly the same weight in the cooked state due to absorbed fat or milk. The visible volume looks like approximately 1.5 eggs (scrambled), but not excessive piles. Estimating a range, from about 60 grams (small portion) to 90 grams (larger portion) makes sense given the portion size on a medium plate. The midpoint and most reasonable estimate is around 75 grams.

The spaghetti is served on a medium-sized black plate, covering most of the plate surface, with a moderate pile height. Comparing the size of the spaghetti strands to the nozzle of the lighter in the background, the pile appears to be around 15 cm in diameter and about 3-4 cm high. Spaghetti cooked typically has a density around 0.7-1.0 g/cm3 due to water absorption. Estimating the volume: approximate a cylinder shape with roughly 15 cm diameter and 3.5 cm height. Volume = π * (7.5 cm)^2 * 3.5 cm ≈ 620 cm3. Using a density of 0.9 g/cm3 (middle ground), weight = 620 * 0.9 = 558 g. However, this seems high because the spaghetti is loosely piled and not densely packed. Considering the loose nature and air gaps, a more realistic effective density for the piled pasta on a plate might be lower, around 0.5-0.6 g/cm3. Recalculating with 0.55 g/cm3: 620 * 0.55 ≈ 341 g. Based on visual cues and common Swiss plate portion sizes, a cooked spaghetti serving around 300-350 g is quite reasonable. The minimum plausible weight might be about 280 g and the maximum about 370 g for the given volume and density context. Hence, the best estimate is near the midpoint: approximately 330 g.

The waffle is of medium thickness, about 1.5cm to 2cm thick, with an airier (less dense) texture common to waffles. Considering typical density and size, such a waffle usually weighs between 60 to 90 grams. Given the visual thickness and size, an estimate around the midpoint of 75 grams is reasonable. The apple compote covering it does not impact the waffle's weight.

The pasta pieces appear to be cooked and lightly coated with dressing or herbs. The amount visible covers only a small central area of the plate, with some pasta pieces separated around, so the portion is definitely less than a full serving. Considering the plate size and the average density of pasta salad ingredients (relatively dense cooked pasta, some light vegetables), the visible amount looks like roughly 8-10 penne pieces plus some vegetable bits. A typical full portion of pasta salad in Switzerland might weigh around 200-250 grams, but here it's clearly a leftover fraction. Based on volume and density, the visible quantity seems to be roughly 50 to 70 grams. Splitting the difference, the best estimate is around 60 grams.

The context (other foods of known volume) doesn't affect the egg size. The egg halves occupy a small section of the plate relative to the comparatively larger bulgur and ratatouille portions, confirming this is a single egg.

The target food item is a 'branche de chocolat,' a chocolate-covered bar with visible nut pieces or crisps. The chocolate bar appears to be a small-sized snack bar held in a hand, which serves as a good size reference. The visible length of the bar is roughly the same as the width of two fingers, suggesting a length around 7-9 cm. The thickness is about 1.5 cm, and width about 2-2.5 cm. Considering the dense nature of chocolate and added crunch inclusions inside, the estimated volume is roughly a small candy bar size. Typical chocolate bars of this size usually weigh between 30-50 grams. Given the visual size and density, a plausible weight range would be approximately 35-45 grams.

The pizza is cut into four slices, and appears to be a medium-thin crust with typical toppings. The diameter of the whole pizza is roughly 22-24 cm based on the plate size and slice proportions. Cooked vegetables like mushrooms and courgettes add some moisture and weight but not excessively dense. Olives are small but denser and add some weight as well. The pizza is moderately topped but not heavily overloaded. A whole medium pizza of this type typically weighs around 300-400 grams. Since there are four slices present, the total pizza is about 350 grams estimate, so each slice is roughly 87 to 90 grams. The image shows portions consumed with some crust and toppings intact, and all four slices present.

The specified food item is the salad, which includes lettuce, carrots, avocado, olive oil, and vinegar. Visually, the salad portion takes up about one third of a standard dinner plate, with visible leafy greens, thin carrot strips, and some chunks of avocado. The lettuce is leafy and low density, the carrots are thin slices, and the avocado pieces add some density. The salad is lightly dressed with oil and vinegar, which would not add notable weight. Estimating volume based on the plate size (approximately 24 cm diameter), the salad portion looks to be around 150-200 ml in volume considering leaves and other components. Taking density into account: lettuce ~0.15 g/ml, carrots ~0.6 g/ml, avocado ~0.95 g/ml (medium density), and averaging for mixed salad, a density estimate around 0.4-0.5 g/ml is reasonable. Multiplying volume (~170 ml midpoint) by density (0.45 g/ml), the estimated weight is about 75-85 grams. A plausible range would be from 70 grams (lighter, more leaves) to 90 grams (more avocado). The midpoint estimate will be 80 grams.

The specified food item is 'colrave crue', which appears as peeled and sliced kohlrabi pieces on a small white plastic tray. The pieces are relatively thick and cover most of the tray's surface area. Given the typical size of such trays (approximately 15-18 cm long) and the fact that the kohlrabi slices are about 1-2 cm thick on average, we can estimate the volume. Kohlrabi has a density similar to other bulbous vegetables—somewhat dense and crunchy. The total volume of the slices looks similar to about one medium kohlrabi, which generally weighs around 200-300 grams. Considering some variability in thickness and size of the pieces, a plausible weight range is 220-280 grams, with a midpoint around 250 grams.

The fresh spinach (épinards frais) is visible as loose leaves covering a significant portion of the bowl. The bowl is roughly 20 cm in width judging by the comparison with the cherry tomatoes and falafels. The spinach leaves look fresh and not densely packed, lying flat and stacked up to about 1-2 cm depth overall. Fresh spinach leaves have a low density, roughly 30-40 grams per 100 ml. The volume appears to be around 150-200 ml of loosely piled leaves. This suggests a total weight range of about 45 to 80 grams (considering the light leafy nature and loose layering). A midpoint estimate of about 60 grams is reasonable and aligns with the visual volume without overestimating the weight given the loose and fresh leaves. Therefore, 60 grams is a well-grounded estimate for the quantity of fresh spinach visible in the bowl.\",\n  \"épinards frais\": 60\n}"
