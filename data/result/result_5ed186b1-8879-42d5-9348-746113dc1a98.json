The salade de pâtes (pasta salad) is a portion of spiral pasta mixed with some visible vegetables such as pieces of tomato, corn, and green vegetables. The quantity of pasta salad on the plate occupies a moderate section, not heaped but visibly covering a small part of the plate. Given that cooked pasta Swiss portions typically range from 120-150g but this portion looks smaller than a full standard serving, I estimate the visible amount to be slightly below a typical serving. The portion appears to be around two-thirds of a standard small serving, considering the size relative to the duck and sausage. Thus, a reasonable weight range would be about 80g to 110g, with a final estimate close to the midpoint at around 95 grams. This accounts for the density of the pasta and the small amount of added vegetables without overestimating the portion size based on volume alone.\",\n  \"salade de pâtes\": 95\n}",

The piece appears to be a standard dessert slice, approximately one-sixth or one-eighth of a whole tart. The strawberries on top are dense and fresh, roughly five whole strawberries cut in halves or quarters, and there is a visible layer of creamy filling and a thin crust base. Considering the density of the custard or cream and crust together with the strawberries, the total weight should be moderate. A typical full tart weighs about 400-500g, so a single slice would weigh approximately 60-80g. Given the visible size and volume, I estimate the slice weighs about 75g, with a plausible range of 65-85g to account for filling thickness and berry amount.\",\n  \"tarte aux fraises\": 75\n}",

The target food item is 'huile de lin' (linseed oil), which is typically used as a dressing or finishing oil and appears here as a small amount that is either absorbed or lightly drizzled on the other components, not a visible portion by itself. Since linseed oil is a liquid and usually served in controlled, small amounts (around 5-15 ml, roughly 4.5-13.5 grams given the density close to 0.9 g/ml), and no visible pool or bottle is present, it's most reasonable to estimate a typical portion size in such a plate setting. Given the visible amount presumably drizzled over the salad or other items, a logical estimate is around 10 grams. This fits with typical culinary usage for a dish of this portion size without excessive oil.\",\n  \"huile de lin\": 10\n}",

Typical rhubarb tart slices weigh less than dense meat or pasta dishes. Given the visible size relative to the fork, the tart slice appears to be about 15-18 cm long on the longest side and has moderate thickness. The rhubarb pieces are not dense but contribute to the weight. The crust, filling, and fruit together suggest a weight range of approximately 120-160 grams for this slice. Midpoint estimation is around 140 grams. This fits well within typical dessert portion sizes and corresponds visually to the size of the slice and the contained ingredients.\",\n  \"tarte à la rhubarbe\": 140\n}",

The poivron (red bell pepper) is located in the middle bottom left of the plate, cut into thin strips, approximately 8-10 pieces in total. These strips are cooked or sautéed as indicated by their softer texture and slight browning. Considering the volume the pepper strips cover and the typical density of cooked bell pepper, this portion is moderate but not large compared to the other food items on the plate. Swiss portions for cooked vegetables typically range from 200-300 grams, but this serving is visibly smaller and more like a side vegetable portion. Hence an internal weight range of roughly 50-80 grams would be plausible. The poivron slices do not fully cover a large surface and are relatively thin, so the midpoint estimate of about 65 grams fits well. This estimate also aligns with the size relation to the chicken pieces and tomato slices which have similar moderate volumes. Thus, the estimated weight of the poivron is 65 grams.\",\n  \"poivron\": 65\n}",

The bowl appears to be filled with roughly 16-18 clusters of muesli, each about the size of a small walnut piece. Considering that muesli clusters are typically light but dense, and estimating the cluster size and bowl volume, the total weight looks moderate. Standard portions of dry muesli range around 40-60 grams. Given the quantity and visual fullness of the bowl, the weight appears closer to the upper side of this range but not excessively full.

The plate is of average size with a standard cutlery set next to it for scale. The tomato slices are moderately thick and densely arranged, covering the entire plate. Taking the size of the plate and the tomato slices into account, the volume corresponds roughly to 4 medium-sized tomatoes. Typical medium tomatoes weigh about 120-150g each, but the tomatoes here are sliced and slightly interspersed with seeds and dressing that don't significantly add to the mass. Considering dressing and seeds add a small negligible weight, the estimated total weight is about 480-600 grams.

The cheese cubes look to be of standard small size, roughly 2-3 cm per side. There are about 5 cubes visible in total. Given that typical cheese cubes of this size weigh around 15-20 grams each, and considering the density of semi-hard cheese, each cube likely weighs about 18 grams on average. Multiplying by 5 cubes gives an estimated total weight range between 85-95 grams. Considering some variation in size and density, a plausible range would be 80-100 grams, with a midpoint estimate of about 90 grams.

The sprouts are lightly spread and occupy a relatively small volume compared to the other ingredients. Given their low density and that they consist mostly of water and air, the mass is not very high despite the visible volume. Typically, a handful of such sprouts in a salad might weigh between 20 and 40 grams. Considering the portion size visible here and comparing it to the more dense neighboring elements, a plausible weight range is around 25 to 35 grams.

Visually, the cup is full and the yogurt appears smooth and dense, consistent with a typical natural yogurt portion. The apple beside it helps confirm the scale: the yogurt container is about the same height as the apple but with a smaller diameter container, which aligns with a 125g yogurt cup. Therefore, considering the visible container and typical Swiss portion packaging, an estimate of 125 grams for the 'yaourt nature' is appropriate.\",\n  \"yaourt nature\": 125\n}",

Considering the container size relative to the millet galettes on the right (5 small pieces) gives a sense of scale: the container is approximately 12-14 cm wide. The vegetable portion occupies roughly 6 cm width with a moderate depth. Given cooked vegetable density and volume, this portion likely weighs between 130g and 180g. Choosing a midpoint for final estimation yields about 155 grams.\",\n  \"courgette et oignons\": 155\n}",

The patties are compact, roughly round, and each appears to be about 5-6 cm in diameter and about 1.5-2 cm thick. Considering their density as a combined grain and bean pattie, they are likely to be denser than a cooked vegetable but less dense than pure meat. Each patty is visually about the size and thickness of a small savory cake. In Swiss portion terms, a single serving of such a grain and legume patty might be around 120-150g in total. Given we see five patties but they are small and stacked closely with little height, I estimate each patty to weigh about 25-30 grams. Multiplying for five patties gives a range of 125 to 150 grams. To finalize, I choose the midpoint weight of approximately 138 grams as a reasonable estimate of the total weight for all galettes present.

The pasta portion occupies roughly one-third of the container's area but is slightly less dense, with visible grooves from fusilli type pasta. The grated parmesan is a light topping and does not add significant weight. Considering the Swiss typical cooked pasta portion for a meal is about 180-250g, but noting the pasta is a side portion alongside chicken and vegetables, the portion should be smaller. Visually, the volume of pasta appears moderate, likely around 140-160 grams cooked weight. The container size and the relative portion to the chicken also support this. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the pasta weight is approximately 150 grams.\",\n  \"pâtes\": 150\n}",

Considering that cooked salad portions in Swiss contexts typically range from 200-300g for a main serving and this is clearly a side portion, a much smaller weight is expected. Visually, the salad looks like about a quarter or less of a typical side serving. Estimating a plausible range around 40-60 grams based on density, volume, and comparison to the risotto portion which looks moderate-sized, I place the final estimate around 50 grams.

Considering the Swiss portion reference of 200-300g for cooked vegetables, and noting this is a side dish alongside rice and fish, a smaller portion is expected. Visually, the vegetables occupy a reasonable volume but are not piled high, suggesting a weight toward the lower-middle of the range. A plausible range would be 120-180 grams, and choosing a midpoint, an estimate of approximately 150 grams is appropriate.

Compared to the other foods on the plate (gnocchi and cauliflower), the eggs portion is moderate in size but not overly dense. A typical Swiss portion of scrambled eggs would roughly range between 100-150 grams. Given the visual volume and the plate size, the scrambled eggs here seem to be about three-quarters of a standard portion, as the pile is wide but shallow. The realistic portion range is approximately 90-120 grams, and positioning the estimate near the middle, I conclude a weight around 105 grams.

The image shows a black plate of cooked spaghetti with a dollop of green pesto on top and grated gruyère cheese sprinkled around. The spaghetti portion appears moderately sized, loosely piled without compactness. Given the size of the plate, the pasta occupies roughly half to two-thirds of the plate’s surface, and considering typical portion depth, the volume looks consistent with a single serving. Swiss reference portions for cooked pasta range approximately 180-250g for a full serving, but visual observation suggests this portion is slightly less than a full serving, likely representing around 150-180g. The pesto and cheese contribute minimal weight and are not included in this weight as the target is spaghetti only. Comparing with the nearby fork handle and scale plate gives a reliable size context. Thus, estimating a weight range for the spaghetti at 140-180g, I select a midpoint estimate of about 160 grams, which suits the visual evidence and portion size context without overestimation.\",\n  \"spaghetti\": 160\n}",

From the image, we see two slices of pain bis, each about the size of a typical sandwich slice, average thickness, and with some spread of mayonnaise and toppings. A typical slice of pain bis weighs roughly between 40 and 60 grams depending on thickness and density. Since the slices appear standard-sized and not overly thick or thin, the likely weight for one slice is near the midpoint of this range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the pain bis slice to be approximately 50 grams.

There is some applesauce ('compote pomme') spread over part of the waffle, but since the target is the 'gaufre' only, I exclude the sauce weight. The waffle has a moderate thickness and density typical of a Belgian-style or workshop waffle, not overly thick or thin. Considering the size and visible volume, a reasonable weight estimate is around 85 grams.

Considering the size of an average dinner plate (about 25-28 cm diameter), the amount of sauce covers approximately 40-50% of the visible pasta surface. The depth of the sauce seems modest, likely around 1-2 cm. Swiss portion reference for meat or meat-based sauce serving is about 120-180g. Given that this is a sauce on pasta rather than a standalone meat portion, the quantity might be on the lower to medium side of that range. Taking into account that pasta with sauce generally has a sauce portion slightly less than a standalone meat portion, I estimate the sauce bolognese weight in this portion to be between 110g and 140g, with a midpoint estimate of around 125g.

Based on the number and size of spears, the total weight is likely around 70-85 grams. Considering a slightly denser cooked texture and the visible portion size, a reasonable estimate would be near the midpoint, around 78 grams.

Tiramisu is a dense dessert with creamy and moist texture, so it weighs more than it looks for its volume. A standard Swiss portion for tiramisu ranges close to 100-150 grams. Given that this slice is fairly generous but not overly large, a reasonable weight range would be 110-140 grams.

Considering the chips' airy texture and typical serving presentations, the pile looks like about one standard snack portion roughly the size of a standard 28-30g bag serving. The individual chip sizes are moderate, and the pile is not very thick, meaning it likely isn't more than one standard portion. Therefore, based on visual volume, texture, and standard snack portions for similar bean chips, I estimate the weight to be around 28 grams, with a plausible range of 25-32 grams to account for slight variation in pile thickness and chip size.\",\n  \"chips vaya beans\": 28\n}",
