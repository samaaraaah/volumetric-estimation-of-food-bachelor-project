First, I identified the grated carrot ('carotte') in the bowl; it occupies roughly one third of the upper part of the bowl, mostly on the right side. The carrot is grated and creates a textured, somewhat fluffy pile, which can make it look larger than its actual weight. For volume comparison, the carrot covers a substantial area and appears slightly piled, creating an internal depth. Based on the size of the bowl (comparable to a standard Swiss salad bowl of about 16-18 cm diameter) and visual comparison with the cucumber and tomato pieces, I estimate the grated carrot portion would come from a medium-sized carrot or a bit more. Grated carrot tends to have a density of about 45-50 grams per 100 ml tightly packed, and here the carrot is moderately packed. The volume seems about 1 to 1.5 Swiss handfuls, roughly 100-130 ml. Therefore, a reasonable estimation for the weight of the grated carrot is approximately 60 grams.\",\n  \"carotte\": 60\n}",

They are the three orange-brown patties, visibly containing millet grains, black beans, and corn. Step 1: I locate three galettes, stacked and overlapping but separate enough to see their boundaries. Step 2: Each galette is about the size of a large cookie, approximately 6-7 cm in diameter and about 1-1.5 cm thick. Comparing to the size of the mushrooms and salad leaves next to them, each one is compact and dense. Step 3: Millet and black beans are relatively dense, similar to cooked grains and legumes, so their apparent size will underestimate the true weight. Step 4: For portion calibration, a standard homemade vegetable/legume patty this size in Switzerland typically weighs 35-45g each. For three, that produces a visual range of 105-135g. These do not look overly large or small so the portion is around the middle of the range. Step 5: Cross-check that not much is hidden under other foods; only a little overlap is present and no significant hidden volume. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the galettes millet haricots noirs maïs to be 120 grams.\",\n  \"galettes millet haricots noirs maïs\": 120\n}",

There are several clear pieces of green asparagus mixed into the rice salad, distinguishable by their color and typical long, slender shape. Counting methodically, there are about 4 to 5 visible segments, each around 4-6 cm in length, and some pieces may be partially hidden under the rice. Asparagus is denser than leafy greens but still relatively light and absorbs some water during cooking; each visible segment could weigh about 7-10 grams. Considering their size and possible hidden portions, the total bulk of asparagus on the plate seems to comprise a small handful. For a salad portion of this type, and given the Swiss context (not overly large), I'd estimate a range of about 25-40 grams. Since asparagus is distributed across the dish, and accounting for potential hidden segments, I will select 33 grams as a visually justified, conservative medium estimate.\",\n  \"asperges\": 33\n}",

There are several parsnip pieces spread throughout the dish, with visible chunk thickness and length. Comparing to plate size and other vegetables, the visible parsnip pieces look like roughly 1/5 of the total mound of food. Taking into account the density—parsnips are similar in density to potatoes and denser than eggplant/cooked beetroot—I visually gauge all visible parsnip pieces together would weigh about as much as a small handful, likely in the 40-60g range. Given the Swiss context (modest portions) and the fact that some parsnip may be hidden beneath other vegetables, a reasonable estimate lands in the middle of the range.

First, I visually identify the 'pâtes' (pasta) as the penne and fusilli forming the base layer in the bowl, topped with a fresh tomato-based sauce. Next, analyzing the portion: the pasta fills the center of a standard shallow soup/pasta bowl, with its outline visible under the sauce. Pasta is semi-stacked, not completely flat, and there is visible empty space around the heap, suggesting a moderate Swiss portion. In terms of depth, considering the central pile and a slightly thinner edge, I estimate about a double-layer height, appearing roughly as a medium serving. Pasta is a dense, cooked food, usually heavier than it looks, and Swiss portions are typically more conservative than American ones. Comparing with common measured servings (Swiss restaurant or home context for pasta), a visible portion of this size typically weighs 120-140g for a main, less if it's a sidedish. Since the plate is not fully covered and there is considerable open white space, but the pasta is still moderately heaped, I will select a value at the lower-middle end of a standard main portion range.

Visually, it evenly covers the upper surface of two small slices of rustic bread. The layer appears relatively thin but is not transparent, indicating a true spread rather than a light smear. Next, I compare the slices with standard bread dimensions for the Swiss context—the slice size is about half a regular tartine (likely 6-7 cm wide each). Estimating coverage area to be about 12 x 7 cm total, and the spread thickness about 2 mm. Crème de marrons is dense, about 1.1 g/cm³. Calculating the approximate volume: 12 cm x 7 cm x 0.2 cm = 16.8 cm³. Multiplying by density gives about 18.5 grams.

Step 1, visual identification: there is only one pear, and it appears whole with skin intact. Step 2, dimension analysis: the pear is fairly large, filling the palm of an adult hand and extending from the base of the fingers to above the hand, which typically suggests a size of about 12-14cm length and approximately 7-8cm at the widest girth. Comparing to the visible hand and reference objects in the background (watch, plate), its girth is consistent with a large, typical European pear. Step 3, density considerations: pears are relatively dense fruits, more so than apples but less dense than bananas, and the skin is included as it's fully visible. Step 4, portion size calibration: the pear looks larger than average for Swiss portions, suggesting a weight toward the upper end of standard pear ranges (usually 140–220g). Step 5, cross-validation: there are no hidden or missing parts of the fruit, and the size fits well with what is typically seen for large Comice or Conférence pears. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this pear to be approximately 200 grams.\",\n  \"poire\": 200\n}",

The image shows a rectangular stainless steel container with one large wrap (galette) that appears to be cut into two pieces. The focus is only on pain/galette, so only the tortilla/wrap bread should be estimated, not the filling. Step 2: Dimension Analysis. The wrap appears to be of standard tortilla/galette size, covering most of the long side of the container. Comparing its size to typical Swiss serving wraps, the total length is about 22-24 cm, and its width is 14-16 cm, with a typical thickness for wraps. Step 3: Density Considerations. The bread is dense and compact but not as heavy as filled foods; processed wraps are standardized in weight, usually lighter than they appear but denser than sliced sandwich bread. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration. Standard galette wraps (for burritos/tacos) in Switzerland are almost always 45-60 grams each. These pieces together appear to make a single wrap, rolled and cut, so we estimate one whole galette. Step 5: Cross-Validation. No hidden sections are visible, and this matches expectations for a single full-size wrap. Standard size in Switzerland is typically 50 grams when plain.

The dish appears to be a lunchbox containing tagliatelles (pasta), omelette aux tomates (egg with tomatoes on the left), gruyère râpé (grated cheese, on top), and tomato sauce ('sauce tomate'). The tomato sauce is visibly coating the tagliatelles and mixed into some areas with cheese, with a reddish-orange appearance streaked through the noodles and slightly pooling underneath. Based on the amount visible, it looks like the sauce is lightly but evenly distributed over the pasta, not a thick or heavy layer. For Swiss portion context, sauce is typically more reserved compared to US servings. Considering the sauce is not gathered as a pool but clings thinly to the pasta, I estimate the sauce forms a moderate coating of perhaps 2 to 3 tablespoons (about 30-45g), but I need to adjust upward for the portion size and hidden sauce underneath the noodles, likely increasing this to 50-60g. Based on the coverage, bowl area (medium lunchbox), and pasta density, a reasonable estimate for the tomato sauce is 55 grams.\",\n  \"sauce tomate\": 55\n}",

Only the chocolate tartlette half is relevant. Assessing portion size, this is not a whole tartelette but precisely half of one, as each tart is cut in two. A standard individual tartelette in Switzerland is usually 7-8 cm in diameter and weighs about 70-80 grams when whole, including pastry shell, ganache, and decorations. This chocolate one appears dense with ganache, nuts/flakes at the edge, and a thick chocolate layer—denser than fruit tarts. Since only half is present, the estimate must be split accordingly. A whole would be in the 75 g range, so half would be 37.5-40 g, but the chocolate layer is substantial, and some edge decorations increase density. Adjusting slightly upward within the plausible half-range, the best estimate for the visible tartelette aux chocolats half is 40 grams.\",\n  \"tartelettes aux chocolats\": 40\n}",

Comparing the slices to the size of the grains of blé and the container itself (this looks like a Swiss-style square glass lunch box, approximately 12x12 cm), the tomato slices seem to come from a medium-sized tomato. The tomato pieces are stacked closely together, with the visible volume suggesting about one whole tomato (not a large one). A typical medium Swiss tomato weighs between 90g and 110g when whole. Adjusting slightly downward for the core cut out (which is missing), the total visible edible slices are likely in the 85g to 100g range. Based on the compactness and thickness of each slice, and the overall portion size seen, I estimate the weight of the tomato slices to be 95 grams.\",\n  \"tomate\": 95\n}",

Gâche is a type of brioche-like bread, and in this image, there are two slices on the table, each with chocolate spread ('pâte à tartiner au chocolat') on top. Only the bread is being estimated, not the spread. Step 1: There are 2 slices present. Step 2: For dimension analysis, each slice is roughly square shaped and appears slightly thicker than regular toast, about the size of a typical palm. Based on the nearby glass and keys for reference, each slice seems to be about 11x11 cm and about 1.5-2 cm thick. Step 3: Gâche is quite dense and buttery, similar to brioche, so it will be heavier than standard white toast. A typical thick brioche slice of this size weighs about 35-40 grams per slice in Swiss context (smaller than some French or US versions, but still substantial). Step 4: There are two slices, both appear full-sized, so that's 35-40g per slice x 2 = 70-80g. Step 5: Double-checking for hidden food or underestimated thickness, the slices are not extremely thick, so the estimate should stay mid-range. Therefore, the estimated weight for the gâche (bread only, both slices) is about 76 grams.\",\n  \"gâche\": 76\n}",

For dimension analysis, I note the cookie appears homemade and is relatively thick with a rough, craggy texture. Compared to the granite background, it appears to be about 8-10 cm in diameter and about 1.5-2 cm thick, suggesting a substantial volume. In terms of density, cookies are relatively dense due to their ingredients (flour, butter, sugar, chocolate), especially thick ones like this. For portion calibration, Swiss portions are often a bit smaller, but this cookie looks like a typical bakery-style American cookie, not a miniature; nevertheless, it doesn't look oversized. Based on standard weights of similar thick chocolate chunk cookies, which generally range 45-70 grams depending on exact size and thickness, and factoring in this one's medium-to-large size for a single, I estimate its weight at 60 grams.\",\n  \"cookie\": 60\n}",

The slice is about one-sixth of a standard tart, judging by the curvature and surface area, and it nearly spans the plate's diameter. Comparing to the utensils, the slice is approximately 12-14 cm at its longest edge and about 8-9 cm at the base, with a visible depth of roughly 2.5 cm. Step 3: Density considerations. The tart slice consists of a pastry base, a fairly thick rhubarb custard layer, and generous chunks of rhubarb, making this a moderately dense dessert; heavier than a dry cake but lighter than a dense meat pie. Step 4: Portion size calibration. A standard whole Swiss rhubarb tart typically weighs 900-1100g. For one large slice (about 1/6th of a tart), a plausible range is 140-185g, with average density. Given the visible size and fullness of toppings, this piece should be at the medium-to-upper end of that range. Step 5: Cross-validation. No container weight is included, and depth is clearly visible. The estimation falls in line with Swiss-sized tarts (not oversized).

Now, regarding the dimensions: each bread slice is approximately 10-12cm long which is typical for Swiss bread, and both slices are nearly fully covered with jam on the upper surface. Comparing to the known area of a slice of rustic bread and considering the thickness of the jam (an average of 2mm, slightly chunkier and prominent in some places), I estimate each slice has around 15-18g of jam. Together, this results in a total range of 30-36g.

There appear to be some concentrated clusters and a lighter scattering elsewhere. For dimension analysis, the sunflower seeds are small, around 1-1.5 cm in length each; there are many visible, but none piled very thickly, and the actual coverage across the salad suggests a modest handful. Comparing to the size of the egg and the salad leaves, the serving looks like a typical sprinkle for texture, not a bulk topping. In density considerations, sunflower seeds are dense (similar to nuts), so a small amount by volume is heavier than it appears. A standard Swiss portion, when sprinkled on a salad as this, usually ranges from 10 to 20 grams. Visually, this looks like a small handful — not overly generous. For calibration, I'd classify this as a small-to-medium portion based on the sparse coverage and comparing with typical restaurant salads. Cross-validating, I note that people sometimes underestimate small seeds, but in this case, the layer is visibly thin and doesn't build up to a pile.

The pastry appears puffy but not very thick through the center. Step 3: Density considerations – puff pastry is light and airy, but the addition of tomato sauce adds a bit of weight. Such a feuilleté is less dense than bread, more dense than chips. Step 4: Portion size calibration – a standard Swiss apéritif feuilleté of this size generally weighs between 11 and 16 grams (based on bakery listings and comparative context); this one leans on the smaller side, so I select towards the middle-lower end.

There are no obstructions, but some rice is covered by the ratatouille, so I must estimate the total volume. Next, I compare the rice's portion size to the eggs and plate size: this appears to be a medium-sized dinner plate. The visible rice portion looks like roughly a piled segment taking up approximately 1/4 of the plate, with additional rice under the ratatouille. The mound of rice is thicker than a mere surface layer, with height comparable to the ratatouille heap, suggesting significant depth/density. Considering the density of cooked white rice (relatively dense and compact), a standard Swiss portion for rice is about 120g (for a small portion) to 160g (medium) or even 180g (large). Given the visual volume, accounting for hidden rice beneath the sauce and the mound By cross-referencing against standard objects (like the large fried eggs and general plate size), I'd classify this as a medium-to-large portion.

Step 3: Density considerations. Apples are dense, high-water fruits. A whole medium apple, including its core, typically weighs about 140-160g in Swiss context. The core and seeds are intact here. Step 4: Portion size calibration. Only one half of the apple is visible and considered; typically, this half would be 70-80g because the average Swiss apple is about 150g (for the whole apple), subtracting nothing since the core remains.

Given that this is a typical Swiss meal (smaller portion), and considering visual density from the cream and distribution, a normal serving would include 2 to 3 tablespoons of sauce, likely weighing 35–50 grams. Cross-referencing with the total visible volume and the sauce coverage, and knowing that thick cream-based sauces can be denser than they look, the likely total is on the lower-middle range. Therefore, the estimated weight of 'sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon)' is 43 grams.\",\n  \"sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon)\": 43\n}",

The sandwich appears to be made with a small Swiss-style baguette, much shorter and thinner than a standard French baguette (Swiss portions are smaller). Comparing to the parchment paper and the apparent absence of a plate, I estimate this baguette to be about 18-20 cm long and quite slender, probably 5-6 cm in width and around 4-5 cm in height/thickness. Step 3: Density consideration. The composition is classic bánh mì: baguette, visible slices of pickled daikon and cucumber, fresh herbs (cilantro), shredded carrot, and likely a modest serving of cooked beef (not heavily filled). The bread is crusty and airy, the filling includes both dense (beef) and light (vegetables, herbs) ingredients. The sandwich appears lighter than a densely filled sub, and the beef is not the predominant component visually. Step 4: Portion calibration. For a small Swiss-style bánh mì with modest beef and a good amount of vegetables, a reasonable weight range is 140-180g. This sandwich looks like a typical Swiss takeaway portion (smaller than US or Parisian versions), so I will use the lower-middle of the range. Step 5: Cross-validation. Considering that the baguette alone likely weighs around 75-80g, and with the visible modest vegetables and a probable 30-40g of beef, my total estimate is around 155 grams, reflecting a standard Swiss lunchtime sandwich portion.\",\n  \"sandwich bahn mi au bœuf\": 155\n}",

Visually, the pasta portion appears to fill about half of a standard metal bento lunch box. Using the visible spirals (fusilli), I can see that the layer is not just superficial; it appears to be about 2-3 cm deep and densely packed. Comparing the size of the pasta portion to the other items (chicken fillets and green beans), this looks like a substantial but not oversized serving, appropriate for a Swiss portion (smaller than US sizes). For a packed lunch, such a volume is typically 130-170g cooked weight.

Given the plate’s known size (Swiss plate, likely about 22-24 cm diameter), this wedge occupies a modest area, suggesting a small to medium Swiss portion. From density considerations, cheesecake (fromage blanc-based) is moist and denser than a sponge cake but lighter than a baked cheesecake. In Swiss context, small slices from an average 22 cm cake weigh about 70–110g. Given the visible slice size, thickness, and lack of heavy crust, this is not an oversized serving.

Eggs and tomatoes both have moderate density, and the omelette here appears fluffy but still substantial rather than thin. For a 2-egg omelette with tomato, the typical raw starting weight is 2 eggs (approx. 50g each) + about 40-60g of tomato, yielding a total uncooked weight near 140-160g; after cooking, there is some moisture loss, but tomatoes retain some liquid.

Peeled carrots lose only a small part of their weight compared to whole carrots. For Swiss portions, carrots are typically smaller than those seen in the US. The density of a raw carrot is fairly high (~0.9-1g/cm³). For this size, standard Swiss peeled carrots would weigh between 90 and 120 grams.

Brownies are dense due to a high content of chocolate, butter, and nuts, so the apparent volume likely underestimates the actual weight. For a piece of this size, and using the Swiss context (smaller portions), a dense brownie this size typically weighs between 50 and 70 grams.

Based on the visual size and airiness, a portion this size (Swiss context: moderate, not overly generous) would typically weigh in the range of 110-140g. Given the apparent volume (fairly large for soufflé but not a double portion) and its airy structure, I will select a point toward the middle of the range, accounting for both crust and interior.

The épautre layer looks slightly loose but substantial, and I can see some grains layered underneath at the sides, suggesting there might be a bit more depth than is directly apparent. Step 3: Spelt is a dense, cooked whole grain and maintains a moderate weight per visual volume, similar to cooked barley. Step 4: Portion calibration — in a Swiss context, a standard cooked grain serving in a lunchbox is usually 80–120g, but this is a generously filled segment, above the smallest portion but not overflowing, so I’d set a range of 100-140g. Since the épautre takes up around a third of a full lunchbox and appears about medium-full, I will estimate towards the mid-high of that range.

For reference, a typical Swiss grilled sausage of this size (slightly smaller than the typical bratwurst) generally weighs between 40g and 60g, with this specific sausage at the lower end of a standard serving. Taking into account Swiss portion sizes (smaller than US), the sausage appears to weigh around 50g.

Standard medium hard-boiled eggs in Switzerland typically weigh about 53-55 grams each including the yolk and egg white, after peeling. Since there are no shell remnants and both eggs are intact, I will multiply the average weight by two: 2 eggs × 54 grams = 108 grams.

Each cashew nut appears to be of average size; cashews typically weigh about 1.2-1.5 grams per nut. The hand size suggests these are standard cashews, not jumbo. Step 3: Density considerations. Cashews are a dense, processed nut, so their size corresponds closely to their weight — no fluff or air gaps. Step 4: Portion size calibration. With 12 pieces, multiplying the average individual weight (assuming 1.3 grams per nut for a Swiss portion) gives a range of 14.4 to 18 grams. For this moderately filled handful, I select a midpoint: 16 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation.

Lettuce is very light and airy, often leading to overestimation if one judges only by volume. Comparing the bowl to the nearby tortilla wrap, it is a standard single-serving salad bowl. In the Swiss context, a typical serving of green salad in such a bowl is between 30g (light) and 60g (very full and compressed); this looks solid but not pressed down tightly.

Comparing its volume to the asparagus spears—each roughly finger-sized—it looks like a rounded, moderately generous portion but not excessively large. A typical heaped tablespoon of mayonnaise weighs about 20-25 grams. Given the Swiss portion context (smaller portions), and the fact that it doesn't seem overly large, I lean toward a slightly smaller end of this typical range.

For portion dimension analysis, the tomato chunks collectively fill about 1/3 of the medium bowl, which is a common Swiss salad portion size. Given the bowl's reference size (standard, roughly 12cm diameter), this equates to roughly the yield from half a medium tomato (about 60g) or slightly more. Tomatoes are moderately dense and somewhat juicy, so their apparent volume is close to their true weight.

The pieces are small to medium-sized, fitting comfortably on a medium plate with extra space. Considering Swiss portion sizes tend to be modest and comparing the pieces to the plate, each whole strawberry would weigh around 12-15 grams. For 6 strawberries, the estimated weight would thus be in the range of 72-90 grams. Accounting for the variation in strawberry size (some seem a bit larger, others smaller), and given their density (not overly light or dense), I will select a value near the center of the range.

Comparing these to the slice of baguette and the mergez sausage on the same plate, each beef cube is about 3 cm per side and looks dense and cooked through (not overly shrunk by cooking). For beef, a cube of 3x3x3 cm weighs approximately 25-30 grams due to its high density. With three such pieces, the total estimated raw weight would be about 75-90 grams, but as it is cooked, some water content is lost. In Swiss portion context (typically conservative), and based on visual volume confirmation, I estimate each cube at about 23 grams (total 69 grams), slightly adjusting downwards to account for the cooking shrinkage which makes them denser.

Both slices look like they are from a medium-sized avocado, and there are no other obvious pieces of avocado mixed with the other vegetables. Step 2: Dimension Analysis. Both avocado slices together make up about 1/4 to 1/3 of a whole avocado when compared to the other foods and the standard size of a lunchbox compartment. The slices are thick, about 1.5 cm in depth, with a combined length of around 8-9 cm. Step 3: Density Considerations. Avocado is a dense and creamy fruit, and appears heavier than it looks. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration. A full medium Swiss avocado typically weighs 180g with skin and pit, or about 120g edible portion. Since we see about 1/4 to 1/3 of a whole, that's between 30g and 40g. These are generous slices, but not more than a third. Step 5: Cross-Validation. Comparing the avocado volume to the other foods (especially the cubes of tofu for reference), my estimate is toward the higher end for 1/4 to 1/3 of a medium avocado.

Step 3: Density Considerations – Strawberries are less dense than cooked grains but have significant water weight. One medium strawberry (whole) typically weighs about 12-15g. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration – Estimating at 8-10 whole strawberries gives a range of 96g (8x12g) to 150g (10x15g).

For dimension analysis, a standard dinner plate in Switzerland is typically about 25cm wide, and the millet mound covers a section roughly 9cm by 9cm, with an uneven, loose depth. The millet is not tightly packed but not extremely fluffy either, suggesting a medium density similar to cooked couscous, which is about 1.1 g/ml. Visually, the mound seems about 1.5-2 cm deep on average. Approximating the shape to a rough cube: 9cm x 9cm x 1.5cm = ~120ml volume. Multiplying by typical cooked millet density, that's 120ml x 1.1g/ml ≈ 132g.
