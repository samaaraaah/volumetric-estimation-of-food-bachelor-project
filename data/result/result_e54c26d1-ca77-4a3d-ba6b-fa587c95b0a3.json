The image shows a small transparent blue bowl held in a hand, with the crème caramel inside. The amount of crème caramel is somewhat shallowly filled in the bowl, covering the base but not piled up. Considering the bowl's diameter appears to be similar to the width of a hand and estimating volume visually, the portion looks like a small homemade serving. Typically, such a serving in a small bowl ranges from 100 to 150 grams. Based on the visible depth and spread of the crème caramel, I estimate the weight to be around 120 grams, which lies near the midpoint of this range and is plausible given the creamy, dense texture of the food.\",\n  \"crème caramel\": 120\n}",

The biscuit layer looks moist but not very thick, and the cream topping is quite thick and smooth, with visible raspberries and blueberries on top that add to the total weight. Given the size relative to the plate and the density of the components, this slice likely weighs less than a typical full dessert portion but is consistent with a reasonable slice size. Considering typical Swiss dessert portion sizes and the visual appearance, I estimate the weight range to be roughly between 100g and 140g, with a midpoint near 120g. This accounts for the biscuit base, the cream, and the fruit in a compact but sufficiently filled slice. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'délice des dieux' slice is approximately 120 grams.\",\n  \"délice des dieux (biscuit, fruits rouges, séré+mascarpone)\": 120\n}",

Sweet potato waffles are denser than standard waffles but not very heavy. Each quarter appears moderately thick and compact. Judging by the size compared to the plate and the visible texture, one full waffle would likely weigh between 120 and 160 grams. Since the photo shows the whole waffle cut into four pieces, the total weight of the waffle should be about 140 grams, making each quarter roughly 35 grams. The estimation is for the entire waffle before additions like sauce or smoked salmon. Therefore, the estimated weight for the gaufre à la patate douce is around 140 grams based on visual observation and typical density of sweet potato waffles.\",\n  \"gaufre à la patate douce\": 140\n}",

Based on the size and volume of these tomato chunks and visual comparison to the cucumber, the tomato portion appears moderate but not large. Typically, a small side salad portion of tomatoes arranged like this would weigh between 50 and 90 grams. Judging by the thickness and number of tomato pieces, the total weight is probably closer to the middle of this range.

The pieces of cervelas are medium-sized cubes within a thick sauce with visible kidney beans. Considering the plate is a standard size (about 25 cm diameter) and estimating the volume of the chili portion as moderate but dense, the amount looks substantial but not overly large. Swiss meat portions suggest 120-180g of meat/fish per serving, and chili contains both protein and beans. Taking the density of the sauce and beans into account, the total chili mass including cervelas and beans would be larger than just the meat portion alone. Estimating minimum-maximum weight around 200-280g, with a midpoint near 240g is reasonable. This accounts for the protein content plus beans and sauce volume.

Given the visible dimensions and typical density of cooked zucchini and onions (which are mostly water), this portion looks like a modest side dish rather than a main. Swiss typical cooked vegetable portions range between 200-300 grams, but this portion appears slightly smaller than a full serving. An internal plausible range would be around 140-180 grams considering the container size and fullness. The midpoint of this range, about 160 grams, is a reasonable estimate for this amount of cooked courgette and onions in the container.

Considering the plate size and the relative volume, the mashed potatoes cover a roughly 10 cm by 12 cm area with a thickness of about 1.5 to 2 cm. Mashed potatoes have a moderate density but are not heavy like meat. Typical single Swiss servings of mashed potatoes range between 180-250 grams. Given this portion looks like a moderate side portion accompanying stew meat and carrots, it likely weighs less than a very large serving but more than a small spoonful. I estimate a plausible range of 150-200 grams for the mashed potatoes in this dish, with a final estimate close to the midpoint, about 175 grams.

Blueberries generally weigh approximately 0.5 to 1 gram each depending on size. These appear medium sized and fresh, so each is likely close to 1 gram. Therefore, the total weight of the blueberries is roughly between 10 and 12 grams. Considering the visible volume and spacing, as well as calibration with the other foods in the bowl, the best estimate is around 11 grams.

The typical Swiss portion for tiramisu as a single serving is roughly around 120-150 grams, but this piece appears somewhat smaller than a full dessert slice, possibly due to it being cut smaller or partially eaten. Considering the size relative to the plate and the forêt noir piece, the tiramisu is likely between 90 and 130 grams. Midpoint estimation yields about 110 grams. This accounts for the creamy, moist texture which adds some weight without being overly dense like cake.

The pasta appears to be a mix of penne and another shell-like pasta, coated with a creamy sauce. The Swiss reference portion for cooked pasta is around 180-250g, but this serving looks slightly smaller than a full average serving, likely because it is plated alone without sides. The gruyère cheese topping is roughly a tablespoon or slightly more, appearing as grated small granules. Typically, one tablespoon of grated cheese weighs around 8-12g. Estimating the pasta carbonara alone at around 140-170g based on volume and sauce coverage, and the gruyère at about 10g, the cheese portion is relatively small. For this task, focusing on the gruyère weight, the estimated weight is near 10 grams.

The wrap appears thin and flexible with visible texture typical of a whole grain or rye galette. Standard galette wraps typically weigh around 60-70 grams for this size and thickness. There is no visible folding or extra layers, so we consider one single wrap.

Comparing the slice to the plate diameter and the size of strawberries, the portion looks like a standard single serving slice of tart. Typically, a slice like this would weigh less than a full large tart but still contain the fruit, cream, and crust. Based on the appearance and portion size, an estimated plausible weight range is about 80-120 grams.

The tartine appears to be a bite-sized or small piece of bread, with a relatively thin but uneven layer of chestnut cream and butter, not heavily piled. Typical small slices of toasted bread weigh about 20-30 grams. The spread of chestnut cream along with butter adds a small additional weight, estimated around 10-15 grams total for both spreads given the coverage and thickness. Combining these estimations, the total weight of the tartine with crème de marrons and butter is likely in the range of 30 to 45 grams. Choosing a midpoint estimate, I place the total at about 38 grams.

Judging by the size of the bread pieces and the slices of meat nearby, this piece of gruyère appears to be about 2 cm thick, and roughly 12 cm long with a narrow width of around 2-3 cm. Gruyère is a dense cheese, so the volume corresponds closely to weight. A typical density for firm cheese like gruyère is about 1.1 grams per cubic centimeter. Estimating the volume approximately (length x width x thickness) = 12cm x 2.5cm x 2cm = 60 cubic centimeters, this gives a weight around 66 grams. Considering some slight visual margin of error, a plausible range would be 60-70 grams.

Judging from the coverage and pooling, the sauce volume looks moderate, enough to coat the meat and some surrounding area, but it is not a thick or heavily ladled portion. Typically, onion sauce serving to accompany roast meat ranges around 30-70 grams depending on the liquidiness and amount. Visually, this sauce portion corresponds roughly to a medium sauce pour, not a small drizzle or a large boat portion. Considering the visible spread, the sauce likely weighs around 50 grams.

The portion appears moderately sized—covering roughly a quarter of the plate area and piled around 1.5 to 2 cm thick. Considering the density and water content typical of cooked kidney beans, and comparing their size to the curved pasta and the plate's diameter (standard dinner plate ~25 cm), the portion seems substantial but not overly large. Swiss portion size for beans in a meal is often around 100-150g per serving, but visual evidence here suggests it is somewhat smaller than a full portion because the plate contains three different main components and the beans portion is smaller compared to the pasta amount.
