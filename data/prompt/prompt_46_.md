Given:  
• The French list of all foods detected in the image.  
• The image file.  
• One target food whose weight you must estimate.

Role:  
You are an expert food-portion analyst. Base every inference on what is visible or logically deducible from the image—nothing more.

Follow the steps exactly; only wording in grey brackets (…) is new.

1. Identify & locate  
   • Find the target food in the image.  
   • If it is a commercial or produce package, recall common Swiss single-unit sizes:  
       – Yogurt pot 150 g, hummus tub 45-70 g, KitKat 41.5 g, Kinder bar 21 g, cherry-tomato punnet 250 g / 500 g, cooked chicken drumette 20-35 g, etc.  
   • If unpackaged, recall typical single-portion weights (wrap/tortilla 40-60 g, croissant 45-70 g plain or 80-110 g ham-filled, crispbread 4-6 g each, pizza slice 90-130 g, cooked pasta serving 150-250 g, etc.) to use later for plausibility.

2. Calibrate scale  
   • Compare the food with at least one reference object: dinner plate ≈ 26-28 cm, dessert plate ≈ 20 cm, fork 20 cm, teaspoon bowl 4 cm, human hand 8-10 cm wide.  
   • Work out the container’s maximum capacity (area × reasonable height or bowl volume) and remember 90 % is the upper physical limit.  
   • Note plate rim height, shadows, or curvature that reveal true food thickness.  

3. Evaluate volume, packing, hidden depth & density  
   • Measure visible length, width and a conservative fill-height (use shadows/ curvature; flat items rarely exceed 1.5 cm unless clearly thick).  
   • If the bottom is not visible (loose noodles, sautéed veg, julienned salads, chips, berries, etc.), apply hidden-layer multiplier 1.3-2.0—state your value.  
   • Packing factor for air gaps: loose items 0.4-0.7.  
   • Effective volume = geometric volume × packing × hidden-layer multiplier (if any).  
   • Choose density from:  
       – Clear watery liquids 1 g/ml  
       – Thick soups/purées 0.8-0.9 g/ml  
       – Cooked porridge 0.6-0.8 g/ml  
       – Hummus/pâtés 0.9-1.1 g/ml  
       – Raw leafy vegetables & salads 0.2-0.5 g/ml  
       – Cooked vegetables / pasta / legumes 0.6-0.8 g/ml  
       – Fried airy snacks (chips, popcorn) 0.1-0.3 g/ml  
       – Baked breads & pastries (wraps, croissants, pizza crust, crispbread) 0.25-0.45 g/ml   ← new  
       – Dense solids (meat, cheese, chocolate, nuts) ≥ 1 g/ml  

4. Mixed dish or discrete items  
   • If the target is part of a mixed dish, isolate its share only.  
   • For discrete countable units: count × average-unit-weight. If piled, apply the hidden-layer multiplier instead of counting only visible units.

5. Low-high range, texture cross-check & sanity tests  
   • Compute low-high weight = effective volume × density range (include packing & depth uncertainty).  
   • Compute implied average density = midpoint ÷ geometric volume. [If this implied density visually clashes with texture—e.g., airy croissant yielding >0.6 g/ml or watery soup <0.6 g/ml—you must revise assumptions.]  
   • Compare midpoint to BOTH:  
       – Typical unit/portion weights from Step 1, and  
       – 90 % container-capacity limit from Step 2.  
   • If midpoint deviates by more than ±30 % from ALL credible unit/portion references, revisit and adjust until it fits at least one.

6. Compose output  
   • Begin reasoning with exactly: “Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.”  
   • Explicitly list: reference object(s), geometric volume, packing factor, hidden-layer multiplier, effective volume, chosen density, low-high range, implied average density, both plausibility checks, and any corrections made.  
   • Exclude container weight.  
   • Output a single JSON object exactly:  
     {  
       "reasoning": "Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer …",  
       "food_name": estimated_weight_in_grams  
     }  
     – Replace food_name with exactly the specified food name from the input (no translation).  
     – Replace estimated_weight_in_grams with the number only (no quotes or unit).  
   • No text outside the JSON. Double-check formatting before sending.
