xjvrtk,tomates cerises,500.0,270,230.0,13.646612080218345,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/5ccbcf64-3631-48df-9e8a-85fb33dbf912,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'tomates cerises', or cherry tomatoes, which are clearly visible in the image. They are contained in a shallow cardboard tray, filling it almost completely. There appear to be about 18 cherry tomatoes in the container. Each cherry tomato is roughly spherical with a diameter estimated visually to be around 2.5 to 3 cm. Cherry tomatoes generally have a density similar to water but slightly less due to their flesh and skin structure. Typical weight of a cherry tomato of this size is approximately 15 grams. Multiplying 15 grams by 18 tomatoes gives us 270 grams. The tomatoes sit on a textured cloth and their relative size can be confirmed compared to the open book and the rim of the tray, supporting this size and count estimation. There is no other food mixed in or significant empty space to reduce the total mass substantially. Considering visual cues and realistic volume, this estimation is plausible for a Swiss context. Therefore, the total estimated weight of the cherry tomatoes is about 270 grams."
p8a2w5,pillons de poulet,112.0,330,218.0,2.897353743918358,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/bdb25c53-2eb7-4a81-b33e-6d28997d0183,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with four chicken drumsticks (pillons de poulet), along with two types of bread, two salads (one green with carrots and vinaigrette, one tomato, mozzarella and cucumber). The drumsticks are moderately sized, appearing cooked with visible spices. Comparing their size to the bread slices and vegetables, each drumstick is roughly the size of a medium finger. A typical cooked chicken drumstick weighs around 80-100g, but these seem slightly smaller than average supermarket sizes, more consistent with Swiss portions. Given four drumsticks on the plate, the total visible weight is likely between 280 and 340g. Considering the visible size, I estimate 90g per drumstick on average, giving a total weight of 360g. However, that seems slightly on the higher side for the visible portions. Adjusting for slight uncertainty and to be precise based on visual cues and Swiss portion sizes, the best estimate is 330g total for the four chicken drumsticks on the plate."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,210,207.0,10.24314702741189,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'salade de tomates'. Visually, the salad contains sliced tomato pieces arranged on a medium-sized plate, with visible dressing of balsamic vinegar and sprinkled flax seeds. The fork and knife next to the plate help gauge scale: the plate is a standard dinner plate approximately 25-27 cm in diameter. The tomato slices cover most of the plate, indicating a substantial volume. Each tomato slice appears to be around 1 cm thick and about 6-7 cm long. There are roughly 12 to 15 slices in total. Tomatoes have a high water content but their density is slightly less than water, about 0.9 g/ml. The visible dressing and flax seeds add negligible weight in comparison. Estimating the total volume of tomato slices as roughly a single medium-large tomato (approximate diameter 7 cm, height 5 cm sliced and slightly spread out) corresponds well with a weight of about 200-220 grams for the tomatoes. Given the arrangement and typical tomato density, 210 grams is a precise and plausible estimate for the 'salade de tomates' portion present in the image."
wrah5h,pâtes,148.0,350,202.0,3.547644476088762,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/115dbd14-27ca-4200-a232-fa9f3eb9bad7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The food item to estimate is 'pâtes' (pasta). In the image, the pasta is located on the right side of the container, appearing as a small spiral-shaped pasta covered partly with tomato sauce and topped with a light layer of grated parmesan. The pasta portion occupies about half of the container's right side and forms a relatively dense, compact pile approximately 10 cm wide and 8 cm deep into the container. The container size appears to be a standard meal prep tray, roughly 20 cm by 15 cm, with the pasta occupying about half the length (around 10 cm). The depth of the pasta is about 3-4 cm, judging from the container and the thickness of the chicken pieces nearby, plus shadows and the dimensions of the container. Pasta once cooked is dense and heavier than solids like green beans but lighter than dense meats. The pasta shape and sauce add a little to the weight and moisture. Considering the portion volume (10 cm x 8 cm x 3.5 cm approx.), the volume of pasta is about 280 cm³. Cooked pasta density is approximately 1.3 g/cm³ due to water absorption and sauce, so multiplying volume by density gives roughly 364 grams. Given the visual estimate and typical Swiss portion sizes which tend to be a bit smaller, I adjust slightly downward to around 350 grams to avoid overestimation. Therefore, the estimated weight of the pasta in the image is approximately 350 grams."
8japfq,"pizza champignons, olives, courgettes",183.0,360,177.0,3.8437166251334993,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/9ac9736b-e0d1-4862-9981-1f47f8109d18,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows four slices of a pizza with toppings: mushrooms (champignons), olives, and courgettes (zucchini). The pizza slices appear to be from a thin-crust pizza, with moderate amounts of cheese and toppings. The olives are whole black olives, about 2-3 per slice, and the mushrooms are sliced moderately thick. The courgette slices are thin and scattered over the pizza. The pizza slices are on a standard-sized large dinner plate, about 26-28 cm in diameter. The four slices cover about two-thirds of the plate, indicating it's most of a pizza of roughly 26-28 cm diameter, suggesting that the total pizza mass would be around 350-400 grams based on thin crust and toppings. Considering the visible amount of toppings spread evenly, the total weight of the pizza is estimated around 360g. Since the food described is the entire pizza portion shown (four slices), the estimated weight corresponds to all four slices combined on the plate. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'pizza champignons, olives, courgettes' shown is approximately 360 grams."

The specified food item is 'courgette et oignons'. In the image, this corresponds to the left portion of the container, showing chopped zucchini and onions cooked together. The container is a square glass dish roughly 12 cm wide judging by the size of the lid clip visible. The courgette and onions occupy about half the container's area, with moderate height—approximately 2.5 cm deep—based on the visible thickness of the pile and the container depth. The courgette and onions are sautéed, likely moderate density, mostly water content but slightly softened and cooked down. We see a generous layer but not heaped. Estimating the volume: about 12 cm by 6 cm by 2.5 cm = 180 cm³. Given that cooked courgette with onions is about 0.9 g/cm³ density (less than water due to air spaces), this yields approximately 160 grams. Considering visual cues and some leafy/light density, I estimate around 160 grams of courgette et oignons here. This is plausible for a cooked portion in a Swiss setting and fits the container size and fill level observed in the image."
r3bub9,pain bis,35.0,170,135.0,0.5606977572089712,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/r3bub9/dish_media/b1cddb5b-7db0-4fb4-9340-d84cd4187243,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'pain bis'. There are two slices of pain bis (brown bread) visible in the image. Each slice appears to be of a typical sliced bread size, roughly 10-12 cm long and 6-7 cm wide, with a moderate thickness typical for sliced bread. The bread is dense, with visible seeds and grains, indicating a slightly heavier weight than white bread but similar volume. Typical densities for dense wholegrain bread are about 250-280 g per 1000 cubic centimeters. Given that each slice is about 1.2 cm thick on average, we can estimate each slice to be about 80-90 g. As there are two slices, the total approximate weight of the bread is between 160 and 180 g. The bread appears intact and not compressed, so no major adjustment is needed. Considering the size and density visible in the image and the typical portion size of pain bis in Switzerland, estimating about 170 g in total for the two slices is a plausible and precise estimate."
xjvrtk,galettes millet haricots noirs maïs,155.0,275,120.0,2.207191171235315,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'galettes millet haricots noirs maïs', which are on the right side of the glass container. There are five small, dense patties made mainly of millet, black beans, and corn. The patties appear compact, with visible grains and beans, and are roughly uniform in size. The container is a standard glass food storage box on a wooden table. Using the cooked courgette and onion portion on the left as a visual balance, the patties are thicker and denser, about 2-3 cm thick each, with diameters around 6-7 cm. Given the density of millet and beans, and the visible size, each patty likely weighs about 50-60 grams. Five patties together therefore weigh approximately between 250 and 300 grams. Considering visual density and the fact the patties are tightly packed without obvious air gaps, a precise estimate is about 275 grams total. This is plausible for a compact, homemade cooked dish in Switzerland, neither too large nor too small."
xjvrtk,myrtilles,200.0,100,100.0,2.373323840037973,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/4d153e2f-e2dc-478b-80de-472793d5b51e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small bowl filled with fresh blueberries (myrtilles). The bowl is handheld, providing a clear scale reference. The size of each blueberry is typical, about 1.5 to 2 cm in diameter. The bowl looks densely filled with blueberries, roughly forming a volume corresponding to a small cup (about 150 ml). Since blueberries have a density close to water but slightly less due to air spaces, we estimate roughly 100 grams of blueberries per cup. Considering there might be slight gaps between the berries, and the bowl is full to the edge, the total weight of these blueberries is approximately 90 to 110 grams. Choosing a precise figure within that range, 100 grams is a solid estimate for the amount of blueberries shown."

The specified food item is 'pâtes' (pasta). The pasta is visible in the bottom half of the plate, taking up a significant surface area. The pasta consists of spiral-shaped cooked pasta (fusilli), loosely piled. The plate size and nearby items provide scale: the kidney beans and green beans portions seem moderate, and the mozzarella is a dollop approximately 3-4 cm in length. The pasta portion is spread in a relatively thin but voluminous layer. Considering the cooked fusion shape, pasta density once cooked is dense but not extreme. The pile is roughly 10 cm wide and 3-4 cm deep at the thickest point, with most of the pasta appearing about 2 cm in depth. Estimating the volume of pasta as roughly 10 cm x 8 cm x 2 cm = 160 cm3. Cooked pasta density is approximately 1.3 g/cm3 due to water absorption and compactness. Multiplying volume by density: 160 cm3 * 1.3 g/cm3 = 208 g approximately. Visually, this aligns as a moderate pasta portion, smaller than a large restaurant serving, consistent with a home-cooked plate in Switzerland. Therefore, the weight estimate for the visible pasta is about 210 grams."

The specified food item is 'croissants au jambon'. In the image, there are two small croissants that appear to be filled with ham. Each croissant is roughly the size of a small palm, and typical croissants from Swiss-style portions are smaller than commercial bakery sizes, weighing around 50-60 grams each when plain. These are ham-filled, which adds weight, but given the thin visible ham layer, the addition is moderate. The two croissants are similar in size and look dense due to the ham filling. Visually, the croissants are not overly thick or heavy, and the comparison to the baguette slices and other items supports a portion size consistent with around 55 grams each. So, the total weight for the two croissants au jambon will be roughly 110 grams. This estimate considers appearance, size, and typical Swiss portion considerations without overestimating thickness or density."

The specified food is the salade composed of salade verte, carottes, avocat, with 1 tablespoon each of olive oil and vinegar. Visually, the salad portion covers roughly one third of the plate. The green leaves (salade verte) appear to be fresh but not densely packed, typical leafy salad density is low. The carrot is julienned or thinly sliced, spread evenly over the leaves, adding slight volume and density but still light. The avocado is visible in chunks dispersed through the salad, which increases the density compared to a leafy salad alone. The addition of olive oil adds some weight but is liquid and minimal, vinegar is negligible in weight. Compared to the fried eggs and bread (common references), the salad portion is medium sized and not heaped. Considering the sandwich-sized bread portion and the plate diameter (typical of ordinary household plates), the salad’s depth appears around 2-3 cm. The avocado pieces and carrots contribute to a moderate density, so I estimate a density around 0.7 to 0.8 g/cm3 for the salad, slightly denser than leafy salad alone due to avocado. The surface area of the salad on the plate approximately measures about 14 cm by 9 cm (~126 cm2). With a depth around 2.5 cm, total volume is about 315 cm3. Multiplying by 0.75 g/cm3 density gives roughly 236 grams. This aligns with the visual portion size, not seeming too large or too small for this salad composition and plate setting in a Swiss context. Thus, the salad weight is estimated at about 235 grams."

The specified food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries) which are visibly mixed within the mixture of cereals and blood orange yogurt in the bowl. The bowl is medium-sized (judging by the spoon and typical table setting scaling). The mixture appears relatively dense, with a creamy consistency from the yogurt and substantial cereal flakes. The blueberries are dispersed throughout the mixture, and approximately 10 to 15 whole blueberries are visible on the surface and slightly beneath the mixture. Each blueberry is roughly around 1.5 cm in diameter, which typically weighs about 1 to 1.5 grams. Considering some blueberries might be partially covered or mixed inside the bowl, it is reasonable to estimate a total visible and embedded blueberry count around 20. Multiplying 20 blueberries by an average weight of 1.3 grams per blueberry gives approximately 26 grams. Given the estimation variability and some hidden berries, rounding slightly upwards to account for depth but not overestimating, the weight of myrtilles in this portion is approximately 25 grams. This estimate is consistent with typical blueberry portions in such bowls in Switzerland and does not seem unusually high or low."
xjvrtk,épautre cuit,160.0,230,70.0,1.329061350421265,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/02911570-1e99-4b2c-9ad0-469321a8a342,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item to estimate is 'épautre cuit' (cooked spelt). In the image, the container has three compartments filled with cooked spelt, scrambled eggs, and baked eggplant. The cooked spelt occupies roughly one-third of the container, visible as a dense grain mixture. The container is a typical medium-sized glass meal prep container, roughly 15x15 cm in area and about 4-5 cm in height. The spelt appears to fill the compartment about 3 cm deep, with a dense cooked grain structure that is moist but not overly compacted. Based on grain size and visual density, cooked spelt weighs approximately 220-240 grams per cup (about 240 ml volume). The measured volume of the spelt portion here is estimated at around 1 cup (about 240 ml). Given this visual assessment, the cooked spelt portion weighs approximately 230 grams. This is plausible for a Swiss meal portion that provides a dense grain side, consistent with the visual volume and texture observed. Therefore, the best estimate for the weight of 'épautre cuit' in this image is 230 grams."
2ahgvr,salade de pâtes,112.0,45,67.0,0.8904711047822476,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a1dcaa3e-bad0-4d16-a8e3-c6217544e407,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'salade de pâtes' visible on a white plate. The portion shown is quite small, with roughly 15 penne pasta pieces mixed with small bits of corn, tomato, and herbs. The pasta pieces are dry penne, not large or thick — typical cooked density applies. The salad looks like a light dressing—no heavy cream or cheese visibly increasing density. The pasta pieces average about 4-5 cm in length and about 1 cm in diameter, so the volume is small, roughly fitting into around 1/4 to 1/3 of a small bowl's worth when plated loosely. Compared to usual pasta servings of 150-200g cooked, this is visibly much less than a standard single serving. The scattered arrangement and small pile suggest closer to a small side portion or leftover. Estimating individual pasta penne weight of about 2-3g per piece and approximately 15 pieces gives around 30-45g for pasta alone. Adding the small volumes of vegetables and dressing adds roughly 5-10g total, so the overall weight estimated is about 40-50g. Considering it's a light salad with low density ingredients, I settle on 45 grams as a precise estimate."

The image shows four strawberries (fraises) in a small green bowl. Based on the size of the bowl relative to the wooden tabletop, and the typical size of strawberries, these strawberries are large. One strawberry is quite large and the others are medium-sized. A typical large strawberry weighs around 25-30 grams, and medium-sized ones around 15-20 grams. Given the four strawberries' visible volume and shape, and accounting for their density and the green leafy tops still attached, the total weight is approximately the sum of one large strawberry (~30g) plus three medium strawberries (~18g each). This results in about 30 + (3 x 18) = 84 grams. This estimate is plausible for this portion size and typical strawberry density in a Swiss context."

The specified food item is ""légumes (courgette, oignon, 1 cs d'huile d'olive)"". In the image, the vegetables are sautéed courgette and onion slices, occupying roughly one third of a standard dinner plate. The courgette pieces are medium thin slices with some sautéed onion strips mixed in. The thickness of the vegetables is consistent with lightly cooked slices, which reduces their volume somewhat but retains density. The olive oil is mentioned as 1 tablespoon (cs), which adds a small amount of additional weight and moisture. Based on the size of the plate and the relative volume of the vegetables, this looks like a moderate vegetable side portion. Given the visible quantity, the vegetables likely weigh around 120 grams: courgettes are dense but watery, onions have similar density, and the oil adds some weight but not dramatically so. This is plausible for a typical Swiss meal portion of sautéed vegetables. Therefore, the estimated weight of the légumes is 120 grams."

The specified food item is 'pousses de graines', visible in the center-left part of the plate. These sprouted seeds form a loose pile intermixed with spinach leaves and cherry tomatoes. The bowl is square and shallow, approximately 20 cm wide based on comparison with the typical size of the cherry tomatoes (about 3-4 cm long) and the fallafels (about 3 cm diameter). The sprouts appear to cover an area roughly 8-10 cm in diameter and about 1.5-2 cm deep, forming a light fluffy mass. Sprouts are low density but still heavier than leafy greens due to their water content and density. Assuming a density slightly lower than water (around 0.6-0.8 g/ml) due to air space, and estimating the volume roughly as a flattened cylinder (approximate diameter 9 cm, height 2 cm) gives a volume of around 127 ml. Multiplying by the lower density (0.7 g/ml) results in approximately 90 grams. This estimate fits well within expectation for a generous handful of sprouts mixed in a salad. It is neither too low nor excessively high. Thus, the estimated weight of the pousses de graines is about 90 grams."

The specified food is 'galettes millet haricots noirs maïs'. Visually, these are the three roughly round patties located centrally in the bowl. Each galette looks dense and compact, composed of millet, black beans, and corn, which are dry and dense ingredients. The patties have a height approximately equal to that of the chopped mushrooms next to them, which look about 1.5-2 cm thick. Considering the surface area of each patty, roughly 7-8 cm in diameter, and the visible thickness, these patties have a substantial volume. Given their density and the compactness of the grains and beans, an individual galette would likely weigh around 80-90 grams. Since there are three galettes, the total weight is about 250-270 grams. The mid-range estimate of 260 grams balances visual volume and plausible density. Nearby items, such as the leafy green salad and purée, help confirm scale - the bowl is a typical medium salad bowl approximately 18-20 cm diameter. The patties fill about a quarter of the bowl's volume, which matches the weight estimate. This aligns with typical Swiss portion sizes and does not seem overly large or small. Thus, the total weight for the three galettes millet haricots noirs maïs is estimated at 260 grams."

The given food item is 'tarte aux fraises' (strawberry tart). Visually, the tart slice is on a standard dessert plate (about 20 cm diameter) which helps gauge size. The slice occupies roughly one sixth to one eighth of a typical tart size. The tart appears to have a base crust, a thick cream or custard layer, and fresh strawberries on top. The strawberries are quite large and dense, with about 7 halved or whole pieces visible. The cream layer looks dense and thick, with some currants or seeds embedded. The crust is crumbly but thin. Considering the overall visible thickness and volume, this slice seems like a typical dessert portion in Switzerland. For such a tart slice with visible fillings and strawberries, a typical weight would be between 90 g and 120 g. Given the visible size, thickness, and density of components, I estimate the weight closer to the middle of this range, about 105 grams. This is plausible and consistent with the visible amount and avoids overestimation or underestimation."

The specified food item is 'légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux).' Looking at the image, the sautéed vegetables portion consists mainly of sliced carrots and chopped leeks. They occupy roughly one third of the plate, adjacent to the rice and fish. The vegetables are cooked, soft, and appear moist but not soggy, suggesting a moderate density greater than water but less than dense cooked starch. Given the spread and volume on a standard plate (~22 cm diameter) and comparing to the rice portion and fish, the depth and volume of the vegetable portion is around 2-3 cm high, with a moderate density. Estimating the volume roughly as a segment about 10 cm by 6 cm by 2.5 cm (150 cm³), adjusting for some air spaces. Vegetables like carrots and leeks with water content density about 0.8-1.0 g/cm³ leads to a weight estimate between 120-150 grams. Considering moderate cooking and visible volume, a weight of 140 grams is a precise estimate for this portion in the Swiss dietary context. This fits typical portion sizes and does not seem unusually high or low."

The ravioli have a moderate thickness and are lightly covered with some seasoning which does not add weight. The overall pile is relatively flat, indicating a reasonable portion rather than a heaping pile. Given the typical density of cooked pasta filled with squash (moist yet dense filling), the estimated weight per ravioli would be about 30-35 grams. Multiplying by 6, the total estimated weight is approximately 180-210 grams. Considering the visual portion size and Swiss portion norms, the middle estimate around 200 grams is reasonable and plausible."
p96w4a,asperges,73.0,130,57.0,0.4937700249199003,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/0513b8db-8592-4ef7-aacf-c117d4030b25,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'asperges' (asparagus). Observing the image, there are about 8 green asparagus spears on the plate. The asparagus spears appear to be medium thickness and typical length (around 15-18 cm). Given the plate size and the relative size of the asparagus to the potatoes and ham, the asparagus is likely cooked and slightly softened but not shrunk heavily. A single medium asparagus spear typically weighs about 15-20 grams when raw; cooking reduces water content, but the visual bulk remains similar in weight. Here, 8 spears likely weigh approximately 120-160 grams raw; considering cooking weight loss, a realistic estimate is about 130 grams. The asparagus fill the plate without overlapping too thickly, consistent with this portion size. This fits a plausible Swiss portion for asparagus. Therefore, the estimated weight for 'asperges' on this plate is 130 grams."

The specified food item is 'viande' (meat). The meat portion is located on the left side of the plate and appears to be a cooked ground meat patty or steak. Judging by the visible portion size relative to the plate, the nearby potatoes, and the salad portion, the meat piece is approximately 12 cm long, 5-6 cm wide, and about 1.5 cm thick. Considering its density is higher than vegetables and close to cooked ground beef density (~1 g/cm³ to slightly more), the volume can be estimated around 12 cm * 5.5 cm * 1.5 cm = approximately 99 cm³. Meat density slightly above water suggests around 1 g/cm³, so the weight is just under 100 grams. The irregular edges and slight charring reduce actual volume somewhat but the thick center compensates. The visible cooked meat piece plausibly weighs around 90-110 grams. Estimating precisely, I assign 100 grams to this portion of viande. This aligns well with typical Swiss portion sizes for a single meat serving on a home meal plate without being too large or too small."
wrah5h,tiramisu,72.0,125,53.0,0.4528301886792453,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/7b0475df-5b02-4072-abb9-ef75acf0f031,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two pieces of dessert on a plate: one slice of tiramisu and one slice of forêt noir. The tiramisu piece is rectangular with visible layers of soaked sponge cake and creamy mascarpone topping dusted with cocoa powder. The size of the tiramisu piece is roughly similar in length to the forêt noir slice but appears less dense. Assessed by visual comparison to the forêt noir and plate dimensions, the tiramisu piece is about 10 cm long, 4 cm wide, and about 3.5 cm thick. Given the visible texture, the tiramisu has a medium density between a mousse and a sponge, probably around 0.9 g/cm³. Volume estimation: 10 x 4 x 3.5 = 140 cm³. Applying density: 140 x 0.9 = 126 g. Doing a plausibility check, 126 grams for this size and density of tiramisu is reasonable for a Swiss dessert portion served at a café or home. Therefore, the estimated weight of the tiramisu slice is about 125 grams."

The specified food to estimate is 'salade de carotte, mais, tomates'. This salad is located at the top center of the plate. It consists of shredded carrot, corn kernels, halved cherry tomatoes, and some leafy greens (likely spinach). The portion is spread loosely but has some volume, indicating a moderate density combining shredded vegetables and corn, which add some weight. The salad occupies roughly a circular area of about 8 cm diameter with moderate thickness, around 1.5 cm, as estimated using the pizza slices and plate size for scale. The plate is around 26-28 cm diameter (standard dinner plate). Given the density of mixed moist salad ingredients, it's heavier than leafy alone but lighter than cooked dense food. Comparing with typical weights and using the visible volume, an estimate around 70-90 grams is reasonable. Cross-checking, the amount does not appear excessively small or large for a side salad portion in a Swiss context. Therefore, a precise estimation is 80 grams, reflecting the visible volume and ingredient composition accurately."

The specified food item is 'pomme' (apple). In the image, the apple is red, medium-sized, and placed next to the croissant for scale. The apple appears typical for a Swiss apple, with a height around 8-9 cm and diameter around 6-7 cm. Its density is typical of fresh apples, which are mostly water with some fiber, giving roughly 0.8 to 0.9 g/cm³ density. Visually, it is about the average size for a medium apple. Comparing to known sizes of apples without relying on standard portion sizes, the apple looks slightly smaller than a large apple but larger than a small one, which fits a range typical of 150 to 180 grams. Considering the visual cues of its dimensions and the nearby croissant, an estimate of approximately 160 grams is both plausible and precise for this particular apple. This estimation is consistent with typical sizes of apples found in Switzerland and looks reasonable for this apple's size in the image."

The specified food to estimate is 'poulet' (chicken). Visually, the chicken piece is a cooked breast portion with visible sauce or jus underneath. It is placed on a standard-sized plate, next to fries and a green salad with visible chopped hard-boiled eggs. The chicken breast appears to be boneless and skinless, with the typical thickness and size of a medium portion. Comparing the length and width to the fries and salad helps gauge size: the chicken breast is roughly 12-15 cm long, about 2-3 cm thick, and roughly oval in shape. This corresponds to a medium portion of chicken breast. Typically, a cooked chicken breast piece of this visible size weighs around 140-160 grams. Given the visual size and that some juices are present but not an excessive thickness or volume, an estimation of about 150 grams is plausible. This aligns with a common medium Swiss portion size and matches the visual cues accurately without overestimating. Therefore, the estimated weight for the 'poulet' on this plate is 150 grams."

The image shows sliced raw kohlrabi (colrave crue) pieces arranged on a small disposable tray lid, which provides a scale reference. The individual pieces are roughly 3 to 5 cm wide and relatively thin, with thickness about 0.5 to 1 cm. The total quantity appears to fill the tray lid without significant piling, suggesting a shallow but spread portion. Kohlrabi has a firm, dense texture, so the volume corresponds reasonably well to the mass. Considering the size of the pieces, the density, and the apparent overall volume, the total weight is likely between 150 to 200 grams. Given the spread and thickness without compression or layering, a careful middle-value around 170 g is appropriate and plausible for this visible portion in a Swiss context. This estimate avoids overestimation given the moderate total volume and nature of the vegetable."

The specified food item is 'pain' (bread). There are three slices of rustic bread on a plate, each slice approximately 1.5 cm thick and roughly 9 cm long by 6 cm wide. The bread is a dense, seeded variety, typical of European bread which tends to have a firmer crumb and crust than soft white bread. Comparing the size of bread slices to the plate's diameter (estimated around 24-26 cm) helps confirm the slice dimensions. Each slice appears to be of medium thickness and density, with no significant missing parts except for one small piece cut away. A typical Swiss rustic bread slice of this size weighs around 40-50 grams. Since there are three slices, and based on visual thickness and density, a reasonable per-slice weight estimate is about 45 grams. The total weight is therefore approximately 135 grams of bread. This matches the visual volume and appearance without over or underestimating. Hence, the estimated weight of the 'pain' visible in the image is 135 grams."

The specified food item is 'galette millet maïs haricots noirs', which corresponds to the two small round patties in the middle-lower section of the container. They appear to be dense and contain visible black beans and maize kernels bound with millet, suggesting a compact texture. Each galette is roughly the diameter of a large coin, approximately 6-7 cm across, and about 1.5 cm thick. Using the visible container size as a reference, the patties are slightly smaller than the palm of a hand and are denser than leafy vegetables but less dense than cheese. Comparing with the adjacent softness of cheese and shredded beetroot/carrot salad, the galettes seem to be compact but not solid. Standard estimation for similar bean and grain patties of this size would be around 60-70 grams per piece. Since there are two patties, combined weight is estimated between 120-140 grams. Given the visual thickness and density, I estimate approximately 65 grams per galette, totaling 130 grams. This aligns with Swiss portion sizing which tends to be moderate and avoids overestimation. The patties are fully visible, so no need to adjust for partial volume. Therefore, the best estimate is 130 grams for both galettes together."

The specified food item is ""pain/galette,"" which in this context refers to the flatbread or wrap visible in the image. There are two wraps shown, one completely rolled and one partially eaten and open on one side. The wraps have a diameter of roughly 18-20 cm (typical for such flatbreads) and appear to be of the thin and soft type, with some char marks. The container holding the wraps is a standard metal food tray, which provides scale—an edge length of approx 20-22 cm. The thickness of the flatbread is around 2-3 mm, as typical for galettes of this kind. The density of the wrap (mostly flour, water, cooked on a griddle) is light but denser than air-filled bread. Given the total visible area and typical weight per unit area of such flatbread, one full wrap of 18-20 cm diameter and 2-3 mm thickness usually weighs around 70-90 grams. Since two wraps are present, and the partial wrap is slightly smaller due to the eaten part, a reasonable estimate is about 80 grams per full wrap and approximately 50 grams for the partial one. Adding these gives around 130 grams total weight of the pain/galette visible in the image. This estimation is visually grounded on size relative to the tray, the thinness of the wraps, and the visible portion eaten, which reduces the total weight accordingly."

The specified food item is 'pomme,' which is an apple. The image shows one whole apple placed on a flat surface. The apple appears to be small-sized, judging by the visible texture and stem proportion, and there are no other objects for direct size comparison, but the surface (likely a table) and the shadow suggest a typical small apple form. Considering Swiss apples tend to be moderately sized, and this apple looks smaller and somewhat rounded rather than large and elongated. The apple skin looks dense and firm, suggesting a typical density for an apple. Given this, estimating the weight directly from visual scale and form, a small apple usually weighs between 120 to 150 grams, but this one looks slightly on the smaller side. Therefore, a reasonable and precise estimation would be closer to 130 grams."

The waffle is about the size of a typical adult palm, roughly 10 cm by 7 cm, with a thickness visible at the edges of about 1.5 cm. The waffle texture indicates it's light and moderately aerated, so not very dense. A typical homemade or shop-bought rectangular waffle of this size likely weighs around 70-80 grams due to its thin and porous structure. Given the visible proportions and the typical density of waffles, I estimate the weight of this waffle at 75 grams. Since the task is to estimate only the weight of the specified food item 'gaufre' and not the 'compote pomme,' the compote weight is excluded."

The specified food is 'poivron' (red bell pepper), located in the image as thinly sliced red strips placed near the center bottom of the plate. These strips appear cooked or sautéed because of their glossy surface. Comparing the size of these pepper strips to the nearby chicken pieces and tomato slices, plus the whole plate size typical for a Swiss meal, the volume of pepper slices is roughly equivalent to about half a medium-sized red bell pepper. A medium bell pepper typically weighs around 150-180 grams raw, but here the pepper is sliced and cooked, which reduces water weight and overall volume slightly. Taking that into account, the visible amount of poivron likely weighs about 70 grams. This estimation is plausible considering the portion size and visual density relative to other items on the plate."

The plate shows two slices of bread, each roughly half the size of a typical slice of European-style rustic or country bread. Judging by the typical size and thickness of such bread, a whole slice would weigh about 50-60 grams. Here, we see each piece is about half a slice, so the total bread visible is approximately one full slice split into two parts. Considering the density and the visible air pockets inside the bread, the weight should be near 50 grams total for the visible bread on the plate. There is no evidence of additional bread beyond these two portions, so it isn't necessary to adjust beyond the visual content. This is a reasonable estimate for a Swiss context portion of a slice of artisanal bread."

The image shows a plate of spaghetti with a visible portion of sauce bolognese spread on top. The sauce covers roughly a central area of the pasta mound and appears moderately thick and dense, typical for a meat-based bolognese sauce. The portion of sauce appears to be approximately 10 cm by 8 cm in surface area, and the thickness seems to be around 1 to 1.5 cm based on shadows and the relative height compared to the pasta strands and cheese on top. Given this volume and the sauce's density, estimated slightly above water due to meat and vegetable chunks, the volume corresponds roughly to 80-120 ml. Using a density estimate of about 1.0 to 1.1 g/ml for a bolognese sauce with meat and tomato base, the weight should be around 90-130 grams. Considering the sauce's visual distribution and moderate coverage, a value near the middle of this range is plausible. Thus, the best estimate for the weight of the sauce bolognese on this plate, based strictly on the observed visual portion and density, is approximately 110 grams."

The specified food items are galettes millet, haricots noirs, and maïs, which are combined in the small fritter-like patties on the right of the bowl. There are five patties visible, each approximately the size of a small palm, around 6-7 cm in diameter. The patties are relatively thin, about 1 cm thick. Given the visible texture, including bits of corn (maïs) and black beans (haricots noirs), the density of these patties is moderate. Millet tends to be cooked and compacted in these patties, contributing to a moderate weight. For a patty of this size and density, a typical weight range should be about 40-50 grams each. Five patties at roughly 45 grams each yields about 225 grams total. Considering slight irregularities and some charring which does not affect weight but may slightly reduce moisture, 225 g remains plausible. This aligns with Swiss portion sizes and the plate size reference (a medium bowl) supports this volume and weight estimation. Therefore, the estimated total weight of the combined millet patties with black beans and corn is 225 grams."

From the image, the carrots are sliced thinly and are mixed unevenly throughout the pasta. The visible carrot slices are relatively small and scattered mainly on the top right and some underneath the pasta. The container is a typical plastic bowl, roughly 15 cm in diameter. Comparing the size of the carrot slices to a typical pasta width and the bowl's interior, the carrots cover a small portion of the bowl with thin slices. The visible carrot pieces are about 2-4 grams each, and there appear to be about 3-5 slices clearly visible plus some partially hidden underneath. Because they are thin slices, their density is moderate, and the total volume they occupy is limited. Estimating total carrot mass in the portion considering some hidden slices mixed with pasta, a reasonable weight estimate for the carrots would be about 15 grams. This value is plausible for a small mixed side portion in a Swiss meal setting."

The plate provides a good scale reference: a typical dinner plate is around 25-27 cm in diameter. The chips visually cover a moderate area of the plate but are loosely piled, suggesting a relatively light and airy density. Chips made from beans tend to be less dense than corn chips, given the visible air pockets and texture. The chips are quite thin, so the overall volume of food is moderate. Given the portion size, appearance, and typical density of bean-based chips, a reasonable weight estimation for this amount is around 40 grams. This fits common snack portion sizes and aligns with the visual bulk and thinness of the chips on the plate."

The specified food item is a 'barre de chocolat kinder,' and the image shows one intact Kinder chocolate bar on a wooden surface. The chocolate bar appears to be the well-known Kinder Bueno or similar type, which has a characteristic size and shape: the bar has five segments, each with a layer of white chocolate and milk chocolate. The bar is lying on the wooden surface with no visible wrapper, allowing a good understanding of its size. Using the texture of the wood and the grain pattern on the tabletop as a size reference, the bar appears to be of typical length for Kinder bars, around 10-12 cm. A standard Kinder Bueno bar weighs approximately 43 grams, which fits the visual size, thickness, and density observed here. Since the bar is whole and no part is missing, the full weight corresponds to the visible portion. Thus, the best estimate is the standard weight of a single Kinder chocolate bar, 43 grams. This estimation is fully based on the visible size and common knowledge of this specific processed packaged food item's typical weight, as allowed in the instructions."

The image shows two slices of bread with spreads: one slice has beurre (butter) and mélasse (molasses), the other has beurre and Nutella. The food item to estimate is 'pain' (bread). The slices appear to be standard French-style rustic bread, about 12-13 cm long, 6-7 cm wide, and about 2 cm thick. The bread has a light airy crumb, typical of artisan bread, so it is not very dense. Each slice looks like a medium-thick slice rather than very thick or very thin. Generally, such a slice from a baguette-style or rustic bread weighs around 30-40 grams depending on thickness and density. Given the size, thickness, and visible volume, each slice is approximately 35 grams. There are two slices on the plate. Since the food item is just 'pain', it is reasonable to consider the total bread portion visible in the image, both slices combined, as these slices are listed only as 'pain' in the list. So 2 slices x 35 grams = 70 grams total. This estimation is consistent with typical Swiss portion sizes and the relative size visible compared to the plate and other items in the image. Therefore, the total weight of the bread ('pain') visible is about 70 grams."

The specified food item is 'maréchal', which is the cheese cubes on the plate. Visually, there are four small cubes of cheese each about 2 cm on each side, giving a rough volume of around 8 cm³ per cube. Cheese density (semi-hard variety like Maréchal) is roughly 1.1 g/cm³. Multiplying 8 cm³ by 1.1 g/cm³ gives 8.8 g per cube. With four cubes, total estimated weight is 4 x 8.8 = 35.2 g. Depth and size are confirmed relative to the eggs and salad leaves around. The cheese portion is small but solid, so this estimation is plausible for Switzerland portion size."

The 'salade verte' is the green leafy salad visible on the right side of the plate. It appears as several pieces of lettuce with some dressing, covering a small to medium portion on the plate. The pieces are thin and not densely packed, typical for leafy greens which have low density. The portion size corresponds visually to about a handful of leaves, roughly 1.5 to 2 cups in volume. Comparing it with the adjacent items like the rice salad and the carrot salad, the volume is smaller and less dense. The lettuce leaves' light density suggests a low weight despite the moderate volume. Considering the plate size and other items for visual scale, this portion likely weighs around 40 grams. This weight is plausible for a side salad portion in a Swiss meal context and consistent with the observed volume and density."

The specified food item is ""salami,"" which is visible as a small pile of sliced pieces on the plate, to the right of the radis and below the piece of bread with jambon. The salami slices are thin and small, with some broken pieces visible. The slices look about 3-4 cm in diameter, roughly the size of typical sliced cured sausage pieces. There are approximately 7 slices and fragments on the plate. By judging scale relative to the bread slice (about 10 cm wide) and the radis (radishes) next to it, these slices occupy a small volume. Salami has a fairly dense texture, so weight is strongly related to visible volume. Each slice likely weighs about 5 grams on average considering thickness and density, meaning the total pile is around 30 to 35 grams. This is consistent with a small snack portion of salami in a Swiss context and matches the visual size. The pieces are not piled thickly but spread out somewhat, so the estimate is moderate and plausible."

The specified food is 'avocat' (avocado). Visually, there are two slices of avocado on the wrap, each about 6-7 cm long and about 2 cm wide and relatively thin (approximately 0.5 cm thick). The avocado slices cover roughly a 12-14 cm by 2 cm surface area with thinness reducing volume. Avocado is dense and creamy with an approximate density slightly less than water but not by much. Considering the dimensions, the volume is approximately 12 cm x 2 cm x 0.5 cm = 12 cm³. Avocado weighs about 0.9 g/cm³, giving approx 11 grams. There are two slices, so total weight is roughly 20–22 grams. Given visual cues and the Swiss portion size context, a precise estimate is 21 grams. This fits well with the visible size of the avocado slices compared to the wrap (about 20 cm diameter), tomatoes, shredded carrots, and ham slice. The estimation avoids overestimating thickness or trying to picture unseen avocado underneath."

The image shows four Blevita crackers stacked on a wooden surface. Blevita crackers are processed packaged foods with a known approximate standard weight per cracker. Typically, one Blevita cracker weighs about 9 grams. Since there are four crackers visible, the total weight would be 4 times 9 grams, equaling 36 grams. There is no indication that these crackers are significantly larger or smaller, nor broken, so using the standard weight per cracker is justified and reliable."

The specified food is ""pain"" (bread). Observing the image, the bread slice appears rustic with a thick crust and an airy crumb. The size of the bread slice can be visually compared to the plate's pattern and the typical size of a bread portion. The bread slice is roughly 10 cm long and about 5 cm wide, with a thickness of approximately 2.5 cm. Density of bread is lower than dense foods; the crumb is porous and weighs less compared to the same volume of dense food. Given the shape and size, the volume of bread can be roughly estimated as a rectangular prism: 10 cm × 5 cm × 2.5 cm = 125 cm³. Bread typically weighs about 0.25 to 0.30 g/cm³. Using 0.27 g/cm³ as an average density for this type of artisanal bread, the bread piece weighs approximately 125 cm³ × 0.27 g/cm³ = 33.75 grams. Rounded to a practical precise estimation, this gives approximately 34 grams. This is reasonable given the visual size of a medium piece of sliced bread in a Swiss portion context. No other reference objects contradict this estimate."

The specified food item is 'tomates'. There are three tomato slices on the wrap, each approximately 3-4 cm long and about 1-1.5 cm thick. They appear to be standard fresh tomatoes, cut into wedges. Compared to the fork and the other ingredients, the size is relatively small. Each tomato slice likely weighs around 15 grams given their size and density (fresh tomatoes typically have near water density). Three slices would therefore weigh about 45 grams in total. The tomatoes are not overly thick or large and appear fresh and juicy, making this estimate plausible for the portion shown on the wrap in a Swiss context."

The specified food item is 'carotte'. Visually, the carrots are cut into slices approximately 1.5 to 2 cm thick. There are about 15 visible slices arranged in a single layer on the plate. Typical carrot slices of this thickness and diameter (approx. 3-4 cm diameter as estimated by comparison with the quinoa and plate size) weigh roughly 10-12 grams each, given carrot's density and size. Multiplying 15 slices by an average of 11 grams per slice results in approximately 165 grams. The carrots appear fully cooked (so moist), which affects weight slightly but not significantly. The overall amount looks reasonable and not unusually large or small for a Swiss meal serving. Thus, 165 grams is a plausible, visually grounded estimate for the carrots present on the plate."

The specified food item is 'sauce vinaigrette'. Looking at the image, the vinaigrette sauce is lightly drizzled on top of the tofu à la mangue and some of the vegetables. The sauce presence is minimal and it appears mostly as a thin, glossy layer or small droplets without substantial pooling. This suggests a small quantity, likely less than a tablespoon total. Given the container size (a typical stainless steel lunchbox about 15x10 cm) and comparing the size of droplets and coverage area relative to other ingredients like tofu cubes (about 2-3 cm pieces) and shredded carrot, the vinaigrette likely amounts to approximately 10-15 grams, because vinaigrette is mostly liquid with a density close to water but slightly higher due to oil and vinegar. The portion is consistent with a typical light dressing application in such a meal context in Switzerland. A larger quantity would create visible pools of sauce, which are not seen here. Hence, an estimate of 12 grams is reasonable and precise."

The food item to estimate is 'beurre' (butter). The image shows four slices of bread with a visible layer of butter under the strawberry jam. The butter is spread thinly but covers most of the bread surface. Each slice is roughly 8 cm long and 5 cm wide; the butter layer looks about 1-2 mm thick on average. Butter is dense (about 0.9 g/cm³). Estimating each slice has about 5 grams of butter spread evenly, for 4 slices this totals approximately 20 grams of butter. This estimation aligns well with typical spread thickness for toast in a Swiss context. The butter layer is clearly visible but not thick, so the estimate is both visually and contextually plausible."

The food item to estimate is 'poire' (pear), visible as several cut pieces in a transparent plastic container. From the image, the container appears to be a small food storage box, typical for homemade snacks or meal prep, with a capacity likely around 0.5 liters or slightly less. The pear pieces fill roughly half to two-thirds of the container volume, with visible skin and white flesh. The pieces appear thick and dense, typical for ripe pear flesh. There are about six medium-sized chunks of pear, ranging in size but collectively representing parts of approximately one medium pear. Considering a medium pear generally weighs around 150 to 180 grams including skin, and factoring volume and moisture content visible, the total weight of the pear pieces is close to one medium pear. The flesh density and size of the pieces align well with this estimation. Therefore, an estimated weight of around 160 grams is a reasonable and precise approximation for the pear pieces in this container."

The specified food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries) on the plate. Visually, there are about 11 whole blueberries visible. Each blueberry is about 1.5 to 2 cm in diameter, comparable to the size of a fingernail, confirmed by close size comparison with the strawberries and raspberries on the plate. Blueberries are dense but relatively light single-fruit items averaging roughly 1 to 1.5 grams each. Judging by this portion size and the visual density and size of the blueberries, the total weight of the blueberries on the plate is around 13 to 16 grams. The plate and other fruits help scale and confirm that these are normal-sized blueberries. The plausible weight estimate is therefore about 15 grams, which fits the visual volume and prevents overestimation. This is consistent with typical blueberry weights and the shown portion."

The image shows a slice of tarte à la rhubarbe on a plate, with a fork and a knife nearby for size reference. The plate is a standard size, and the knife is a typical kitchen steak knife, which helps gauge the slice dimensions. The slice occupies roughly one-sixth to one-eighth of a full tart, assuming a normal tart size around 24 cm in diameter. The slice thickness is moderate, with visible pieces of rhubarb that appear fresh and cooked within a creamy filling and a typical pastry crust. Rhubarb is quite fibrous but with significant water content, and combined with the pastry and filling, the overall density is medium, typical of fruit tarts. Comparing the volume visible, and judging from similar slices and typical tart weights, this slice appears to weigh approximately 110-130 grams. Considering the knife length (around 20 cm) and the slice dimensions, the best estimate converges near 120 grams. The weight is not unusually high or low for such a slice in a Swiss portion context, and the tart being homemade or artisan style is typical. Therefore, the final estimation for the slice of tarte à la rhubarbe is 120 grams."

The specified food item is 'oeufs brouillés' (scrambled eggs). On the plate, the scrambled eggs appear as yellow fluffy curds occupying approximately one-third of the plate space. The plate is a standard medium-sized dinner plate (approx. 24 cm diameter) as indicated by the size of the gnocchi pieces and cauliflower florets. The eggs are fluffy but somewhat dense, with visible volume and slightly irregular texture indicating light cooking without excess moisture. Comparing the scrambled eggs portion to the gnocchi amounts (about 20 pieces), which are dense and compact, the eggs are less dense but occupy a similar volume. A typical fluffy scrambled egg portion made from about 2-3 large eggs weighs around 120-150 grams, given typical moisture content and cooking method. The amount on the plate visually corresponds to roughly 2 large eggs worth. Therefore, estimating the weight of the scrambled eggs at about 130 grams is reasonable and aligns with typical Swiss portion sizes and the visual portion size on the plate."

The specified food item is 'salade.' Visually, the salade portion is a small cluster of leafy greens mixed with some visible bits of vegetables or dressing on a large red plate. The salade occupies roughly 1/6th of the plate's area, but it is not piled high, appearing rather flat and loosely packed. Comparing the salade with the adjacent risotto, the risotto mound is considerably larger and denser. The size of the knife handle serves as a reference for scale: the salade portion is roughly 7-8 cm across and about 1 to 1.5 cm thick. Leafy salad is light and less dense than cooked grains or rice, so its weight per volume is low. The salade contains visible leafy greens with some dressing or small bits of other vegetables, not a dense salad like potato or pasta salad. Given the modest volume and low density, a plausible estimate for the salade portion is around 30 grams. This fits typical Swiss small side salad servings and visually aligns with the portion shown on the plate."

The leaves are relatively loosely packed and cover about one third of the plate's surface. The plate size appears to be a standard dinner plate roughly 25-27 cm in diameter. Considering the salad's volume and density (leafy greens are light), the salad layer is thin without significant layering or compacting. The sunflower seeds slightly increase the density but only marginally. Comparing the salad to the risotto portion on the right gives a good scale: the risotto is dense and compact, while the salad is airy and spread out. Given the plate size and volume of greens, a typical loose green salad portion without heavy dressing or added dense ingredients like cheese or nuts usually weighs between 40-60 grams. Here, the salad appears slightly on the smaller side but with some seeds. Thus, a reasonable estimate for the salade's weight on this plate is approximately 45 grams, acknowledging typical Swiss portion sizes and visual cues."

The image shows a small bowl containing a creamy mixture which is a combination of 'séré maigre', 'graines de chia', and 'purée de noisettes'. We need to estimate only the weight of 'séré maigre' in this mixture. The spoon and bowl provide scale, indicating the volume is moderate, approximately 150-200 ml total content volume. The texture looks dense and creamy due to the combination, so not light like a liquid. Assuming the total mixture weighs around 170 grams, 'graines de chia' seeds are dispersed but only present in small quantity (about 10-15 grams max), as they absorb liquid and swell. 'Purée de noisettes' (hazelnut puree) is visible mostly in small swirls, likely about 20 grams. Subtracting these from the total, the remainder is the 'séré maigre'. Hence, estimating 'séré maigre' at around 130 grams is plausible and consistent with the container fill and visible composition in a Swiss context. This avoids overestimation since the bowl is not filled to the rim and the mixture is smooth and dense, not piled up."

The specified food item is 'salade grecque' which is visible in a white rectangular plastic container on a wooden table. The container is about the size of a typical small food storage container, roughly 15 cm long, 10 cm wide, and around 8 cm deep. The salad includes diced cucumbers, red and yellow bell peppers, onions, olives, and pieces of feta cheese with visible salad dressing. The salad pieces are diced small, filling roughly one-third to half the container. Considering the density of the ingredients (vegetables and cheese with dressing), the overall volume of salad is roughly 600-700 ml, but since the container is only filled partway, we estimate around 300 ml of salad volume. Given the mix includes denser cheese and dressing that slightly increase density beyond water, I estimate approximately 1.1 g per ml density, resulting in about 330 grams. This weight fits the visible portion without overestimating the depth or density, and complies with typical Swiss portion sizes and container volumes. Therefore, the weight estimate for the 'salade grecque' is 330 grams."

The specified food item is 'demi croissant'. The image shows a half croissant piece with some visible texture and crumb structure typical of a croissant, along with a spread of butter and apricot jam on top. The croissant piece appears to be about half of a standard croissant. A typical Swiss croissant weighs about 50-60 grams whole. Since this is half a croissant, the weight should be roughly half of that, around 25-30 grams. The visible portion looks fairly dense and typical for a croissant without being abnormally thick or thin. There are no other prominent objects on the plate to change this estimation, and the crumbs size and spread also indicate a standard-size croissant half. The added butter and jam have weight but the task is to estimate only the 'demi croissant' portion itself, excluding spreads. Therefore, the most accurate weight estimate for the half croissant piece shown, given the visible size and typical Swiss croissant portion, is 28 grams."

The container is a rectangular plastic box approximately 15 cm long and 10 cm wide, judging by relative size to a standard kitchen counter tile visible around it. The sliced tomatoes take up roughly one-third of the container lengthwise. The tomato slices are medium thickness, about 0.5 to 1 cm thick on average, with about 6-7 slices visible. The tomato slices are fresh, juicy, and not overly dense like cooked or stewed tomatoes. Given the dimensions, the volume of tomato occupies roughly 1/3 of 15x10 cm base area = approximately 50 cm² area, multiplied by slice thickness (average ~0.75 cm), total volume estimated around 37.5 cm³. Tomatoes have a density close to water but slightly less due to air pockets and structure, roughly 0.95 g/cm³. So, estimated weight = 37.5 cm³ * 0.95 g/cm³ = about 35.6 g. Rounding slightly for minor visual volume uncertainties, the estimated tomato weight is approximately 36 grams, which is plausible for a portion this size in Switzerland.

The specified food item is 'muesli nature'. From the image, the muesli is in a small orange bowl, filled close to the top with clusters of granular cereal. The muesli pieces are chunky but not dense like cooked grains—they are dry and light. The bowl is about the size of a small dessert bowl, approximately 10 cm in diameter, similar in size to a small ramekin. The muesli does not fill the bowl densely due to the air gaps between clusters. A visually comparable volume of loose dry granola generally weighs around 30-40 grams per 1/4 cup (about 30 grams). Given this bowl appears to hold roughly about 1 to 1.5 times that volume, the likely weight ranges between 40 and 60 grams. Since the bowl is piled but not overly dense-packed, and accounting for air gaps, 50 grams is a balanced estimation. This estimate aligns with typical serving sizes in Switzerland for muesli portions, and the visual volume supports this as plausible."

The plate shows a full serving of cooked spaghetti, loosely piled. Comparing the spaghetti to the size of the plate and to the visible spoon in the background, the volume appears typical of a moderate meal portion. Cooked spaghetti is dense and heavy, and the strands have some thickness and volume. The plate is about 22-24 cm in diameter judging by the surrounding objects, and the spaghetti covers the center completely with a height of roughly 2-3 cm of noodle pile, estimating a volume of around 250-300 ml. Cooked spaghetti density usually ranges around 0.8 to 1 g per ml. Given all this, the spaghetti weight is estimated at about 230 grams. The pesto and cheese are not included in this estimate.

Using the plate size as reference (standard dinner plate roughly 25 cm diameter), the mayonnaise portion occupies a space about 4-5 cm across and is about 1.5-2 cm in height with a smooth, dense texture typical of mayonnaise. The thickness and creaminess indicate a high density, close to or slightly above 1 g/ml. Visually, the volume of the mayonnaise is approximately that of a heaping tablespoon, around 15 ml. Given the density and volume, the mayonnaise weight can be estimated at about 15 grams. This estimate fits Swiss portion norms for a small serving of mayonnaise as a condiment on a meal plate and is consistent with the visual appearance in the image."

The image shows two slices of rustic bread with spread toppings on a plate. The bottom slice is specified as 'tartine mélasse + beurre.' The slice is about 12 cm long and approximately 5 cm wide. Given the rustic bread thickness visible (around 2 cm) combined with butter and molasses spread, we can estimate the weight. Bread of this type is dense but porous, with roughly 250-270 g per 1000 cm³ density. Calculating the volume approximately as a half-cylinder: length 12 cm, width 5 cm, thickness 2 cm, gives volume ~ (12*5*2)/2 = 60 cm³. Bread density ~0.26 g/cm³ yields about 15.6 grams for the bread itself. The butter layer appears spread moderately thin, roughly 5 grams. The molasses layer is light and glossy, maybe 5 grams maximum due to thin spreading and liquid density somewhat above water (about 1.4 g/cm³), but very thin volume. Adding these: 15.6 (bread) + 5 (butter) + 5 (molasses) = approximately 25.6 grams. Given the thickness and coverage, a round figure of 26 grams is a precise, visually grounded estimate. This is plausible for a typical Swiss small slice of bread with butter and molasses. The weight includes all components on the slice but excludes the plate or surrounding items."

The image shows a single slice of pizza with visible mushroom toppings, tomato sauce, and a crust. The slice is placed on a typical dinner plate, allowing estimation of size. The slice is about one-quarter or slightly less of a regular medium pizza size, which commonly weighs around 250-300 grams whole. Given the visible thickness of the crust and toppings, and the fact that mushrooms have a moderate density, the slice looks to be roughly 1/6 to 1/5 of a medium pizza portion. The plate and fork provide scale, confirming the slice is not very large. Therefore, estimating the slice weight around 70 grams is reasonable, as it accounts for dough, sauce, cheese, and mushrooms without overestimating volume or density. This is consistent with typical Swiss portions of pizza slices, neither unusually high nor low."

The specified food item is 'salade de pâtes' (pasta salad). Visually, the pasta salad portion is on the bottom left quadrant of the plate. Comparing it with the other items, the pasta salad seems to occupy a moderate space on the plate. The pasta pieces are medium in size (cavatappi or similar), and the salad includes some visible vegetables such as green pepper, corn, and tomato, adding slight volume but not significant density beyond the pasta. The pasta is cooked and somewhat dense, typical pasta density plus small added vegetables leads to slightly increased weight per volume over plain cooked pasta. The portion is roughly as big as the adjacent carrot salad, but carrot salad (grated) is less dense than the pasta salad. The pasta salad thickness on the plate is about 1.5 to 2 cm, and it covers an area approximately 7 cm by 5 cm. This suggests a volume of roughly 50-70 cubic cm. Given cooked pasta density near 1 g/cm3, plus the vegetables, an estimate around 60 grams is plausible. The portion is clearly not very large, consistent with a side serving. Cross-checking with the sausage and duck filet nearby, the pasta salad portion weight being around 60 grams is reasonable within this context for a Swiss meal portion. Thus, the best estimate for the 'salade de pâtes' weight is 60 grams."

The specified food item is 'pain' (bread). In the image, there is one slice of whole grain or brown bread placed on a small black plate alongside two portions of tomato omelette. To estimate the weight of the bread slice, I will analyze its visible size and thickness in relation to the plate and the omelette. The slice of bread appears to be of average thickness (about 1.5-2 cm), and covers roughly one-third of the plate's surface area. The plate is small, suggesting the slice is a single standard piece of bread, not very thick nor thin. A typical slice of this type of bread in Switzerland usually weighs about 30 to 40 grams, depending on density and moisture. This slice looks denser than airy white bread but not very thick. Given its size, thickness, and density, 35 grams is a precise and plausible estimate. It is unlikely to be below 30g given the thickness, and above 40g would imply a very thick or large slice, which is not evident. Therefore, 35 grams is a reliable estimation for the slice of bread shown."

The specified food item is 'épinards frais' (fresh spinach). In the image, the spinach leaves form the base of the bowl and cover a large portion of the plate. The bowl has a typical size and the spinach leaves are spread out relatively flat, but slightly layered. Compared to the size of the cherry tomatoes (around 3-4 cm each) and the falafel balls (around 3-4 cm diameter each), the spinach quantity covers a comparable area but is relatively light and not densely packed. Fresh spinach leaves are light and have a high water content, typically around 30 g per loosely filled cup (about 30-50 g for a bunch of leaves). Here, the volume corresponds visually to about 1 to 1.5 cups of fresh spinach leaves, considering the depth of the bowl and the layering. Given the visual volume, density, and context, I estimate the weight of the fresh spinach to be around 40 grams. This seems reasonable and typical for a fresh spinach salad base without overpacking or wilting."

The specified food item is ""oeufs"" (eggs). In the image, I see two fried eggs placed on top of a bed of cooked pasta with ketchup drizzled on the eggs. To estimate the weight of the eggs, I note that these are whole fried eggs of typical size. The average medium egg weighs about 50 grams when raw. Cooking (fried) will cause slight water loss, but the weight won't drastically change. Each egg is fully visible, including both yolks and the white, so I am confident both eggs are entirely on the plate. Since there are two eggs, I estimate the total weight to be approximately 100 grams (2 eggs x ~50 grams each). The eggs appear standard in size and thickness relative to the pasta underneath and the plate size. No parts of the eggs are missing or hidden. Therefore, an accurate estimate is 100 grams of eggs in total."

The dish includes three main components: grilled salmon, brown rice (riz complet), and a carrot and corn salad. The plate is fairly standard size and the rice portion occupies a compact mound on the plate. The rice grains are cooked and dense, filling an area approximately 10 cm by 7 cm with a modest height around 1.5 cm, leading to a volume estimate near 105 cubic centimeters. Cooked brown rice has a density slightly less than water due to air gaps, around 0.85 g/cm3, so the rice portion weighs roughly 105 x 0.85 = 89 grams. This seems plausible given typical Swiss portion sizes, and considering the rice mound is moderately compact but not piled high. It is neither very small nor overly large. Therefore, the estimated weight of the riz complet on this plate is about 90 grams."

The specified food item is 'glace noisette', which is hazelnut ice cream. In the image, there is a single scoop placed in a small bowl. The bowl has a known pattern size which can be used to estimate the scale. The ice cream scoop appears moderately dense with some rough surface texture typical of semi-soft ice cream. The size is roughly equivalent to a small to medium ice cream scoop, approximately 7 cm long, 3.5 cm wide, and about 2.5 cm thick. Ice cream has a density roughly around 0.6-0.7 g/ml considering air content, but since this is visually more solid and dense, I will use about 0.65 g/ml to approximate. Calculating volume as a rough rectangular prism size (7 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm = 61.25 cm³). Multiplying by 0.65 g/cm³ gives approximately 40 grams. This is consistent with typical single scoop ice cream weights in Swiss portions, slightly smaller than a commercial scoop that is often about 50 g or more. Therefore, the estimate of 40 grams is both visually grounded and plausible."

The hummous is located on the bottom left of the plate; it appears as a creamy spread with a rough texture typical of chickpea-based hummus. To estimate weight, I consider the spread portion relative to the plate size and other items. The plate is a standard dinner plate (approximately 25 cm diameter), and the hummous portion covers a small area, roughly the size of a heaped tablespoon or a bit more, about 4-5 cm across and around 1.5 cm thick. Given the density of hummous is somewhat dense and thick compared to liquids, this volume corresponds roughly to 45-55 grams. Comparing to the other portions, this feels consistent and not exaggerated. Therefore, I estimate the hummous portion weight at about 50 grams."

The specified food item is 'biscuit.' In the image, the biscuit appears as thin, layered, light golden pieces placed on top of the ice cream and next to the meringue. The biscuit covers roughly the surface area above the scoop of ice cream but is not densely packed or thick. Since the biscuit is broken into pieces, the total volume is about 2-3 standard thin biscuit layers, with visible gaps. Comparing size with the glass diameter (about 7-8 cm) and the meringue, each biscuit piece is roughly 5-6 cm wide and thin. A thin wafer or biscuit sheet of this size typically weighs about 5-10 grams per piece. Given there are approximately 2 to 3 such pieces, the total biscuit weight is estimated at around 15 grams. This is plausible for a decorative and crunchy topping on an ice cream dessert in Switzerland, neither overly large nor too light."

This container is common in Swiss retail for individual yogurt servings, typically around 125 grams in volume. The yogurt appears full to the brim without visible air pockets or dips, indicating the container is filled to its standard capacity. Given the typical density and packaging size of natural yogurt sold as single servings in Switzerland, the weight is very close to the volume in grams, about 125 grams. This aligns with the standard individual yogurt pot size that matches the observed container and visual fill level. Therefore, the weight of the 'yaourt nature' is confidently estimated at 125 grams."

The specified food item is ""graines de chia"" (chia seeds) in a mixed dish that includes blanc battu, flocons d'avoine, graines de chia, and miel. The dish is served in a medium-sized bowl, with a creamy white base (blanc battu), oatmeal flakes, visible scattered black chia seeds, and a light drizzle of honey. The chia seeds are well dispersed throughout but do not form a dense layer. Compared to other ingredients, chia seeds typically weigh much less for the same volume because they are tiny seeds. Visually, the chia seeds cover roughly the surface and some depth within the mixture but are not the primary bulk. Given the volume of the mixture and the visible concentration of chia seeds, it looks like approximately 1 to 1.5 tablespoons of chia seeds, which corresponds to around 12 to 15 grams. This volume is consistent with a typical homemade portion of chia seeds mixed into such a dish. The visible plate and objects nearby (like the lighter) support the scale of the bowl, confirming this size estimation. Therefore, the most accurate estimate for the weight of the chia seeds, based on visual assessment and volume relative to the whole portion, is 14 grams."

The specified food item is 'branche de chocolat,' which is clearly visible in the image held in a hand. The chocolate branch is a thin, elongated chocolate bar with small crunchy bits embedded in it. Using the size of the fingers and the wrapper dimensions as a scale reference, the chocolate appears to be about 10 to 12 cm long and roughly 2 to 3 cm wide. The thickness is approximately 1 cm, judging by the visible edges and the fingers holding it. Given that solid chocolate bars of this size with added nuts or crisped rice typically weigh between 25 to 40 grams in Swiss commercial standards, and considering the apparent size and density of this bar, a weight estimate near 30 grams is reasonable. The chocolate is not large or thick enough to warrant a higher weight, nor is it small or thin enough to justify a lower weight. The visible packaging matches typical pre-packaged chocolate sticks sold individually."

The specified food item is 'crème de marrons,' which is visible as a spread on a piece of bread. The bread piece is small and the spread covers the surface with a moderate thickness, appearing smooth and dense. The bread slice itself is about 7-8 cm long and around 3-4 cm wide. Considering the spread thickness is roughly 2-3 mm and its texture is dense (similar to a thick purée), its density is higher than water and typical of chestnut cream. The spread covers the bread unevenly but fully across the visible surface. Estimating the volume of crème de marrons: length 7.5 cm x width 3.5 cm x thickness 0.25 cm = about 6.5 cm³. Given the density is somewhat higher than water (~1.2 g/cm³), the weight is approximately 6.5 cm³ x 1.2 = 7.8 grams. Rounded and accounting for slight variability in thickness, an estimate of about 8 grams is appropriate. This is a reasonable weight for a thin layer of chestnut cream on such a piece of bread."

The specified food item is 'toast'. The image shows two small slices of toast with a light spread of fromage frais on top. The toast appears to be of a standard size, roughly comparable to small sandwich bread slices commonly found in Switzerland. Each slice is lightly toasted and not overly thick. The total volume of the two slices is small, and they are placed on a medium-sized plate giving a good scale reference. Considering the typical density and weight of toasted bread slices of this size, each slice likely weighs around 25g. Thus, two slices together would be about 50g. The fromage frais is spread thinly and would weigh only a few grams per slice, but since the task is to estimate only the weight of 'toast', we exclude the fromage frais. The weight estimate is consistent with the typical portion size and visual clues in the image, not unusually high or low for Swiss portions. Therefore, the total weight of the toast present (two small slices) is estimated at 50 grams."

The image shows a serving of risotto aux asperges, parmesan on a plate. The risotto with asparagus appears dense and creamy, typical for risotto, and contains visible asparagus pieces distributed throughout. The portion size covers a small central area of the plate, approximately 12 cm in diameter. The risotto seems to be about 1.5 to 2 centimeters thick when considering the volume and density. Parmesan is integrated into the risotto, likely melted and mixed rather than in solid shavings, so the weight includes both risotto and parmesan combined. Given the typical density of cooked risotto with cheese and vegetables, I estimate about 1.35 grams per cubic centimeter. The volume of the risotto is roughly estimated as a shallow mound about 12 cm diameter and 1.7 cm height, yielding a volume of roughly π * (6 cm)^2 * 1.7 cm ≈ 192 cm³. Multiplying 192 cm³ * 1.35 g/cm³ gives approximately 260 grams total. As parmesan is part of this mixed dish, and no separate parmesan portion is visible, the weight of parmesan alone cannot be separately quantified and is thus considered part of the total risotto weight. Since the user specifically requested the weight of 'parmesan', which visually cannot be isolated or separated from the risotto in the image, the best estimation is that the parmesan portion is a small fraction of this total weight, typically about 5-10% in such a dish. Choosing a conservative estimate of 7%, the parmesan weight would be approximately 18 grams. This is a reasonable amount given the visible integration and typical dairy cheese content in risotto of this size in Switzerland. Final plausibility check: 18 grams of parmesan for one serving risotto is plausible, not overly high or low. Therefore, the parmesan estimated weight is 18 grams."

The butter piece appears to be solid, with a size approximately similar to a small butter pat from a standard butter dish, roughly about 5 cm long, 2 cm wide, and around 1 cm in thickness based on comparison with the bread slices and slices of meat nearby. Butter density is around 0.95 grams per cubic centimeter. Calculating volume roughly as length x width x height: 5cm x 2cm x 1cm = 10 cm³. Multiplying by density 0.95g/cm³ ≈ 9.5 grams. Given the uneven shape and some missing parts visible, it is reasonable to estimate slightly under 10 grams as served here. This is typical for a small butter portion in a Swiss meal context and visually consistent with the image. Therefore, the estimated weight is 9 grams."

The specified food item is 'oeuf' (egg). In the image, there is a half of a boiled egg visible on the plate to the upper right side of the dish. The egg half includes both the white and the yolk. Considering the size of the plate (standard dinner plate of approximately 25 cm diameter) and the size of other items such as cherry tomatoes and corn kernels, the egg half appears to be a standard boiled egg half. A whole boiled egg typically weighs around 50 grams, so half of this would be approximately 25 grams. The egg seems to be fully cooked with a slightly firm yolk and the white intact, indicating no loss of water weight or texture. Therefore, the weight estimation for the visible egg portion is about 25 grams. This value is plausible in the Swiss context for a single half boiled egg portion and correlates properly with the relative size of the other food items on the plate."

Its volume covers a small mound roughly 6-7 cm in length and 3-4 cm in width, with modest height (about 2-2.5 cm). Comparing the mozzarella size to the pasta spirals and kidney beans nearby, the portion looks to be about a heaped couple of tablespoons in volume. Fresh mozzarella is dense but not heavy like cooked pasta; density is approximately 1 g/ml. The estimated volume is around 45-55 ml, so the weight should be very close to that volume. This gives a confident estimate around 50 grams. This portion size is consistent with what is typical in Switzerland for an accompaniment of fresh mozzarella on a plate of this size. Therefore, the best estimation for the mozzarella portion here is 50 grams."

The bread seems moderately thick, approximately 2-3 cm in height. The texture looks like a regular white bread, somewhat airy but dense enough. A typical slice of this type of bread from a small roll weighs about 30-40 grams. Given the thickness and size visible in the image, I estimate this particular piece to weigh around 35 grams. This estimation excludes the weight of the butter and pâte à tartiner, as requested. This value also corresponds well with typical Swiss bread portions for this type of bread shape and size, making it a plausible and accurate estimation."

Considering the size of the bread slices (roughly standard slice size), the butter layer is thin and uneven, covering most of the visible bread surfaces. Typical thin butter spreads on such slice sizes range from about 5 to 10 grams per slice. Given that the total visible butter on both slices is not thick and does not pool significantly, an estimate closer to the lower end but considering it's on both slices is around 8 grams total.

The bowl seems to be a small cereal or snack bowl, about 15 cm in diameter, judging by common proportions and the visible part of a plastic bottle nearby for scale. The oat flakes are dry, loosely piled, with slight uneven thickness showing a shallow depth, likely about 0.6 cm thick. Given the oat flakes' density as dry flakes, they are light but still have a measurable weight per volume. Estimating the surface area occupied in the bowl as about 40 cm², and multiplying by the depth (0.6 cm), gives an approximate volume of 24 cm³. Dry oat flakes have a density around 0.4 g/cm³. Multiplying volume by density: 24 cm³ * 0.4 g/cm³ = 9.6 grams. For such a small pile, weighing 9 to 10 grams is plausible and consistent with typical dry oat flake small servings.

The surface texture is irregular, implying it has inclusions such as nuts or crisped rice beneath the chocolate layer, which adds volume and density. Given its shape (stick-like and dense with inclusions) and size, its weight is likely between 25 and 35 grams, as standard similar Swiss chocolate snack sticks are roughly in that range.

The image shows two slices of bread on a plate. The slice on the top has a spread of butter and jam, and the slice at the bottom has Nutella and butter. The task is to estimate the weight of the butter (beurre) only. Focusing on the butter layers, the butter is spread thinly on both slices, not in thick pats but lightly covering parts of the bread. Given the size of the bread slices, about 10 cm wide and roughly 8 cm high, and the butter spread thinly (about 1-2 mm thickness with some unevenness), the volume of butter is small. Butter is dense, around 0.9 g/cm³, but the volume here is quite small. I estimate about 3-5 grams of butter per slice considering the visible spread, as the butter is patchy and mixed with Nutella or jam on each slice. Combined, the total butter visible in the image is about 7-8 grams. Since the user asked for butter (beurre) in general, I will give the combined butter weight on both slices, which is roughly 7 grams. This is plausible for a light spread on two slices of bread typically seen in Switzerland. No overestimation or underestimation is needed since butter portions tend to be small when spread thinly and used with jam or Nutella."

The specified food item is ""beurre"" (butter). On the plate, the butter is the pale rectangular block near the fork. Visually, it appears to be a typical table butter portion cut from a larger block. Comparing it to the slice of baguette nearby and the size of the fork, the butter piece is roughly 4-5 cm in length, about 1.2 cm wide, and approximately 1 cm thick. These dimensions give an estimated volume of about 5-6 cubic centimeters. Butter has a density close to 0.9 g/cm³, so to estimate weight, multiply volume by density. Taking volume as approximately 5.5 cm³, 5.5×0.9 = 4.95 grams. Given the small portion size, about 5 grams is a precise and plausible estimate for this butter serving in a Swiss context without over- or under-estimating portion size."

The specified food is 'barre de chocolat kinder,' which is visible in the image as a single Kinder chocolate bar. The standard size of a Kinder chocolate bar (such as a Kinder Bueno bar or similar classic variants) typically weighs around 20-25 grams. The bar shown is a single, unbroken piece and is typical in size for an individual serving. There are no additional pieces or packaging included in the image, so the estimation is just for the visible bar. Given the context and visual appearance compared to the wooden surface (which gives a size reference), the weight is very likely to be close to 22 grams, which is typical for these chocolate bars in Switzerland and Europe."
xjvrtk,huile de lin,8.0,7,1.0,0.0009493295360151893,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/d15f25db-272a-4f8a-a0ae-225438cf4b70,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'huile de lin' (linseed oil). In the image, no visible liquid or oil container is clearly identifiable, and oil is typically served in very small amounts as a dressing or finishing touch. Given the absence of a separate oil puddle or visible shiny surface indicating a noticeable quantity of linseed oil on the plate, it is likely only a small drizzle has been used, absorbed partly into the other foods. Usually, the amount of oil served directly on a salad plate or bowl in a home-prepared dish is about 5 to 10 grams. A higher quantity would create visible pooling or shine, which is not apparent here. Considering the other food items' moist and textured appearances and that linseed oil is a dense, viscous liquid, the plausible estimate is closer to 7 grams. This fits typical Swiss small portion usage and visual cues. Therefore, the estimated weight of the linseed oil is 7 grams."
p96w4a,tomme fleurette,14.0,13,1.0,0.0016613266880265813,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/a11463a4-ab51-4b83-a55f-d4edfb527b13,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'tomme fleurette'. On the plate, there are several cheeses distinguished by their color, texture, and shape. The 'tomme fleurette' is a semi-soft French cheese with a washed rind, generally lighter in color and creamier in texture, appearing here as one of the three cheeses at the bottom right of the plate. It is the middle piece among those three cheeses, identified by its soft creamy interior and washed rind. Comparing size with the baguette slice, which is about 12-13 cm long, and using the knife and fork as reference for scale, the portion of tomme fleurette appears to be roughly a triangular slice about 4 cm by 3 cm at the base, with a height (thickness) about 1 cm. Given the density of soft semi-hard cheese is approximately 1.1 g/ml, its volume is roughly 4cm x 3cm x 1cm = 12 cm³. Multiplying by density yields approximately 13 grams. This size and weight matches a small cheese tasting portion. The weight seems plausible considering the portion is fairly small and visually consistent with common serving sizes in Switzerland. Therefore, the estimated weight of tomme fleurette on the plate is approximately 13 grams."

The specified food is 'salade de céleri,' which is located at the bottom right of the plate. It consists of shredded celery root with what appears to be a light dressing. Based on the plate size and the volume comparison with the other food items, the celery salad has a moderate pile, approximately the size of a small fist. The thickness of the pile is about 2-3 cm, and its spread is roughly 6 cm by 5 cm in area. Considering the density of shredded celery root mixed with dressing (denser than leafy salad but less than pure dense vegetables), the salad's density can be estimated around 0.6 to 0.7 g/cm3. Calculating volume (6 cm * 5 cm * 2.5 cm average thickness) gives about 75 cm3. Multiplying by density 0.65 g/cm3 gives approximately 49 grams. This seems plausible for the visible portion and typical Swiss portion sizes, not too large or small. Thus, the best estimate for the 'salade de céleri' on this plate is about 50 grams."
p96w4a,mélasse,6.0,6,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/b0979eb7-5126-4d9e-9058-64093ecde7e0,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is mélasse (molasses) spread on a slice of bread. The image shows two slices of rustic bread on a plate: the upper slice is topped with a thin layer of butter and a thin spread of mélasse, while the lower slice is topped with butter and a much thicker layer of Nutella. The bread slices appear to be about 1 cm thick with a rough rustic crust, and the plate has a diameter roughly comparable to a standard small plate (about 20-22 cm). The mélasse coverage is thin and patchy, covering roughly 60-70% of the top surface of the bread slice. The distribution is uneven and somewhat translucent, indicating a thin layer rather than a thick paste. Molasses is viscous but dense; however, given the thinness of the spread, the total volume of mélasse is quite small. Estimating the top surface area of the bread slice as approximately 12 cm by 7 cm (84 cm²), and assuming an average thickness of the mélasse spread around 0.5 to 1 mm (0.05 to 0.1 cm) over about 70% of this area (approx. 59 cm²), the volume is roughly 59 cm² * 0.07 cm = ~4.1 cm³. Molasses has a density close to 1.4 g/cm³, so the approximate weight is 4.1 cm³ * 1.4 g/cm³ = about 5.7 grams. Considering some variability in spread thickness, a reasonable precise estimate would be around 6 grams. This estimate aligns with the visual thinness and coverage of the molasses on the bread slice, appearing neither overly thick nor negligible."

The specified food item is 'barre de chocolat kinder,' which is a well-known processed chocolate bar product. The image shows a single Kinder chocolate bar, identifiable by its distinct white and milk chocolate layers. Given the visual size relative to the wooden surface texture and planks, the bar appears to be a standard size, not miniature or oversized. Kinder chocolate bars typically weigh 21 grams each in Switzerland. Since the food item here is a single bar, and the packaging is not visible but the bar matches the standard appearance and typical size, it is safe to rely on the known product weight for a precise estimate. This matches usual Swiss packaging and portion sizes for this product and corresponds well with visible scale cues."
xjvrtk,œuf dur,50.0,50,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/b53715cb-f3f5-4abf-bd1d-b7264f7f0a86,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. In the image, the œuf dur (hard-boiled egg) is visible as two halves placed on the plate to the left side. The halves appear to be from a standard medium-sized egg. Comparing the egg halves to the knife and fork nearby, the size of the egg halves is consistent with the scale of an average large egg. The egg white and yolk are clearly visible, indicating the entire egg mass is present, split in half. Typically, a medium to large hard-boiled egg weighs approximately 50 to 60 grams including shell, but since the shell is removed, the weight is less. Considering the portion shown, it is roughly equivalent to one whole egg without the shell. The two halves combined likely weigh around 50 grams. This aligns with typical cooked egg weights in a Swiss context. No other items or bulk in the photo affect this estimation as the egg halves are clearly separated and represent a single item. Therefore, the best weight estimate for the œuf dur shown is 50 grams."
2ahgvr,graine de chia,6.0,6,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/cca1db77-eb8e-454d-8ea2-e23840f01b97,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The food item to estimate is 'graine de chia' (chia seeds). In the image, the chia seeds are visible dispersed throughout the mixture inside a small glass jar that contains yogurt, oat flakes, oat bran, honey, chia seeds, and almond puree. The total content appears to fill about 80-90% of the jar's volume. The chia seeds appear as small black dots interspersed in the creamy white mixture. Given that chia seeds are typically very light and dispersed throughout the mixture, their weight will be significantly less than the other dense components like yogurt or almond puree. Based on the volume of the mixture in the jar (roughly 200-250 ml) and the pattern and density of chia seeds seen — they appear to be about 1-2 teaspoons worth distributed throughout the jar. One teaspoon of chia seeds weighs approximately 5 grams, and considering visual density, the total chia seeds weight is about 5 to 8 grams. Estimating conservatively on visual density and distribution and the jar size, a weight of around 6 grams for the chia seeds in this jar is reasonable and plausible."
