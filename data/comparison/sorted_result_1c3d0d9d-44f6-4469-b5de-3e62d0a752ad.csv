xjvrtk,tomates cerises,500.0,295.0,205.0,12.231503579952268,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/5ccbcf64-3631-48df-9e8a-85fb33dbf912,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a cardboard tray containing about 18 cherry tomatoes still attached to a vine. Cherry tomatoes typically weigh between 15 and 20 grams each depending on size. These tomatoes look medium-sized and quite firm, suggesting a weight closer to the average of 17 grams per tomato. Multiplying 18 tomatoes by approximately 17 grams gives a range from 270 to 310 grams. Accounting for some variation in size and density, and the presence of a few slightly smaller tomatoes, a reasonable estimate is about 295 grams for the entire portion. This estimation aligns with the visual volume and comparably sized reference objects like the open book and the textured picnic cloth underneath, which confirm the tomatoes are average-sized."
xjvrtk,myrtilles,200.0,43.0,157.0,3.747016706443914,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/4d153e2f-e2dc-478b-80de-472793d5b51e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small bowl filled with fresh blueberries (myrtilles). Blueberries typically weigh about 0.5 to 0.8 grams each. The bowl appears to be small-to-medium sized and is filled nearly to the top with blueberries. By rough count, there are approximately 50-60 blueberries visible. Estimating an average of about 0.7 grams per berry to account for slight size variations, the total estimated weight would be between 35 to 45 grams. Given the full appearance of the bowl, I will estimate on the higher end within this range. Therefore, the total weight of the blueberries in the bowl is about 43 grams."
xjvrtk,courgette et oignons,300.0,155.0,145.0,5.190930787589499,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a glass container divided roughly into two halves: one half contains cooked courgette (zucchini) and onions, chopped into small pieces, appearing sautéed. The portion fills about half of the container volume on that side, with a fairly dense pile of veggies. Cooked courgettes and onions lose water but still retain moderate density, and given the visible volume and thickness of the pile, the portion looks like a medium serving. The container is about the size of a typical lunch storage box, maybe around 15x15 cm in footprint and circa 4 cm depth. Half the container volume corresponds roughly to around 150-200 ml volume for this vegetable mix. Cooking reduces weight compared to raw weight, but density is still significant. The portion of courgette and onions looks consistent with approximately 140-170 grams based on visual volume and density. Taking the midpoint, I estimate 155 grams carefully accounting for the mix and compactness."
p96w4a,croissants au jambon,37.0,145.0,108.0,0.47684964200477326,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/7bd6e67d-b1ca-42e4-a5ca-713b7fadda27,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two croissants au jambon on the plate, located on the upper left side. Each croissant au jambon looks medium-sized, typical for a snack portion in Switzerland. Given their appearance, slightly browned and puff pastry texture, they seem standard-sized croissants filled with ham. A standard croissant alone usually weighs about 50-60 grams, and adding ham inside can add roughly 15-20 grams, depending on the amount used. Since there are two croissants visible, and they appear fully filled and intact, the combined weight should range roughly between 130-160 grams. Considering the croissants' size and density as seen in the image, I estimate the total weight of the two croissants au jambon to be about 145 grams."
xjvrtk,galettes millet haricots noirs maïs,155.0,47.0,108.0,1.9976133651551313,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a glass container with two distinct food items: on the left, cooked zucchini and onions; on the right, five millet patties containing black beans and corn. The target food item is the 'galettes millet haricots noirs maïs'. Each galette looks about 1.5 cm thick and roughly 6-7 cm in diameter, compact and dense from the millet and beans. Considering the size and density and typical weight of such homemade millet bean patties, one patty usually weighs around 40-50 grams. There are five patties, but since the request is to estimate for one galette only, I focus on one portion. Based on visual volume compared to the container size (an approximate 15x15 cm container), I judge each galette to weigh in the range of 40-55 grams. Choosing a medium estimate within this range, the final estimated weight for one galette is 47 grams."
2ahgvr,salade grecque,315.0,210.0,105.0,3.9468973747016705,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/c476a6d0-acb2-45fd-b168-84822bc98003,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a rectangular plastic container partially filled with a Greek salad ('salade grecque'). The salad contains diced pieces of cucumber, tomato, yellow pepper, onion rings, olives, and small chunks of feta cheese. The pieces are finely diced and mixed with a visible amount of dressing. The container appears to be a small to medium size, about the size of a typical meal prep Tupperware, and it is filled to roughly half or slightly more than half capacity. Given the diced vegetables and cheese, which have moderate density, and the volume visible, an estimated weight range would be approximately 180-230 grams. Considering the portion looks fairly full and substantial for a salad, leaning toward the upper half of that range seems reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the salade grecque to be approximately 210 grams."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,320.0,97.0,4.826849642004773,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate filled with sliced tomatoes arranged as a salad, topped with flax seeds (graines de lin) and garnished with green leaves, possibly basil. The plate is a standard medium-sized ceramic plate, approximately 23 cm in diameter, and the tomatoes are cut into wedges and slices. The tomato pieces cover the whole plate surface densely but are relatively thin slices. Given the density and water content of tomatoes, and the volume occupied on the plate, the tomatoes likely come from about 3 medium-sized tomatoes. A medium tomato typically weighs about 100-130 grams. The presence of dressing like olive oil and balsamic vinegar adds negligible weight. Flax seeds are only a small garnish and weigh very little here. Therefore, the total weight of the tomato salad is estimated between 280 and 350 grams. Choosing a midpoint and considering some weight loss due to slicing and juice loss, I estimate the total weight of the salade de tomates to be 320 grams."
2ahgvr,colrave crue,118.0,210.0,92.0,1.2954653937947493,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/3718d88c-ba98-4da1-84dc-7d5ad0a4df92,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plastic container lid used as a plate holding pieces of raw kohlrabi ('colrave crue') cut into medium to large chunks. The portions appear thick and relatively dense, with pieces roughly about 3-5 cm in size and a total volume that covers most of the lid's surface. Considering typical density and water content of raw kohlrabi, and that the container lid size is approximately that of a standard small food container (about 20 cm wide), I estimate the total weight to lie roughly between 180 and 250 grams. The pile is moderately full but not heaped, so a mid-value of about 210 grams is a reasonable estimate for this portion."
p8a2w5,pillons de poulet,112.0,200.0,88.0,1.1761336515513126,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/bdb25c53-2eb7-4a81-b33e-6d28997d0183,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with four chicken drumettes (pillons de poulet) placed on the left side. Each drumette appears moderately sized, typical of a portion served in Switzerland and grilled with seasoning visible. Based on common weight ranges, a single cooked chicken drumette weighs approximately 45-60 grams. Given the size and density shown, I estimate the drumettes are closer to medium size, around 50 grams each. There are four drumettes visible, so the total weight is about 200 grams. The estimate range could be roughly 180 to 240 grams depending on size variation and cooking water loss, but 200 grams is a balanced final estimate that fits the visual scale compared to the bread slices and salad portions on the plate."

The meat ('viande') is a cooked ground meat patty portion placed on the plate to the bottom left. It appears to be roughly the size of a small palm, with some thickness visible suggesting a dense, compact meat portion. The relative size compared to the potatoes (pommes de terre) and lettuce leaves shows it is a moderate portion of meat, not too small or overly large. Swiss portions of cooked meat patties typically range from 100 to 150 grams in similar contexts. Visual density and cooking shrinkage were considered, and there are no additional meat pieces visible. Estimating within a plausible range of 110 to 140 grams, I choose approximately 125 grams as a reasonable final estimate for this single serving of 'viande'."
p96w4a,pain,49.0,130.0,81.0,0.4736276849642005,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/b0979eb7-5126-4d9e-9058-64093ecde7e0,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two slices of rustic bread ('pain') on a standard-sized white plate. The slices appear to be about 1 to 1.5 cm thick, typical for homemade or bakery bread in Switzerland. Each slice is medium-sized, roughly the size of a hand palm, corresponding to about 60-70 grams per slice for this type of bread. Since there are two slices visible, the total weight should be roughly double that. Given that both slices are relatively thick and substantial, the total weight range is approximately 120 to 140 grams. Choosing a mid-value within this range for accuracy, I estimate the total weight of the bread slices to be about 130 grams."
wrah5h,riz complet,82.0,160.0,78.0,0.7632458233890215,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/ee492174-b956-48fe-a4cb-4f059c9bc233,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with three distinct portions: grilled salmon, brown rice (riz complet), and a carrot-corn salad. The brown rice portion occupies about one third of the plate and is spread moderately thickly. Considering the density of cooked brown rice, a typical serving size in Switzerland for a side portion is around 150 grams, but this plate shows a somewhat larger mound than a small side portion, though not quite a large serving. The grains are loosely packed, so the volume is relatively large compared to weight, making visual estimation over 160 grams less likely. I estimate a plausible weight range of 140 to 180 grams for the rice portion with a medium-sized serving appearance. Therefore, selecting a value toward the middle of this range, the weight of the brown rice is approximately 160 grams."

The image shows a plate with five slices of pizza topped with mushrooms (champignons), black olives, and zucchini (courgettes). The slices appear to be medium size, typical for a personal pizza with a thin crust. The crust looks airy but substantial in size, and the toppings are spread moderately with several visible olives (about 6-7), mushroom slices (around 10), and zucchini slices (about 5). Considering the average weight of a full medium vegetable pizza of this type is around 300-350 grams, and this portion corresponds roughly to about 3/4 of a pizza (5 out of 7 slices visible), the total visible pizza weight is likely about 250-270 grams. Since the entire pizza is made up predominantly of dough and toppings together, I focus here on the total weight of the food item specified as ""pizza champignons, olives, courgettes."" The toppings constitute a small but significant proportion of the total weight, but since the dough is included in the 'pizza' term, the entire weight consists of crust plus these toppings. Based on visual assessment, the estimated weight of the pizza portion visible on the plate is about 260 grams, which reflects a typical medium personal pizza with vegetable toppings in a Swiss context."
2ahgvr,salade de pâtes,112.0,40.0,72.0,0.962291169451074,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a1dcaa3e-bad0-4d16-a8e3-c6217544e407,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a partial portion of pasta salad ('salade de pâtes') on a large white plate. The salad is mostly eaten, leaving a small cluster of penne pasta with corn kernels and cherry tomato pieces. The visible portion is quite small, roughly about 10-12 pieces of penne pasta, a few corn kernels (approximately 10), and 2-3 cherry tomato halves. Given that cooked pasta weighs approximately 1.4 grams per penne piece and taking into account the low density of vegetables like corn and tomato, the total weight of the remaining pasta salad is limited. Assuming some small remaining dressing and herbs add minor weight, I estimate a range of 30-50 grams for this leftover portion. Considering the typical fullness of a plate and the visible amount, I choose a value near the middle of this range, estimating the salad de pâtes to weigh approximately 40 grams on this plate."

The image shows a plate with two portions of dessert, one of which is the tiramisu on the left side. The tiramisu slice is about the length of an average cake slice, roughly 10 cm long, 4-5 cm wide, and reasonably thick with visible layers of soaked sponge and creamy mascarpone topping. Considering the typical density of tiramisu, which is creamy but also soaked sponge, a typical portion in Switzerland for this size could weigh between 120-160 grams. Given that this piece looks like a solid portion, neither very small nor overly large, I estimate it to be a medium-sized portion weighing about 140 grams. The other portion on the plate (forêt noir) is separate and does not affect this estimate."

The asparagus (asperges) on the plate are green, slender, and cooked, arranged in a small bundle beside the ham and potatoes. There appear to be about 8 spears, medium thickness, extending about two-thirds across the plate's diameter. Asparagus spears typically weigh around 15-20 grams each when medium-sized and cooked. Given the number and visible size, the total asparagus portion is likely between 120 grams (8 x 15g) and 160 grams (8 x 20g). Considering the asparagus stems are whole and not trimmed heavily, and to avoid overestimating, a mid-range estimate around 140 grams is reasonable. This aligns with the plate's portion size, balanced with the other components, and the visual density of the asparagus."

The target food is 'myrtilles' (blueberries), visible mixed within a bowl of yogurt and cereal. The blueberries appear whole and scattered throughout the mixture. By counting and estimating visible individual berries, there are roughly around 20-25 blueberries in the bowl. A typical fresh blueberry weighs about 1.2 to 1.4 grams. Considering some may be partially hidden or mashed, and that the bowl shows a medium portion overall, the weight of the blueberries is likely in the range of 25 to 35 grams. I estimate the blueberry portion weighs approximately 30 grams, balancing the visible quantity and typical berry weight."

The image shows a plate with three distinct portions: cooked vegetables (courgette and onion), a fried egg, and white rice sprinkled with sesame seeds. The target food is the vegetables which occupy roughly one third of the plate. The vegetables are sliced courgettes and onions sautéed with about 1 tablespoon of olive oil, giving them a slightly shiny, cooked appearance. The portion looks moderate-sized but not large, resembling about one medium side dish portion common in Swiss meals. Given the visible volume, density of cooked courgettes and onions, and considering that cooked vegetables shrink but remain somewhat dense, I estimate the minimum weight could be around 100 grams and the maximum about 140 grams, as the volume is not very thick but spread evenly. The portion is medium-sized, so a plausible estimate in the mid-range of 120 grams is appropriate. This is consistent with the presence of the rice and egg portions, which balance the meal size visually and in weight terms."

The image shows two slices of pain bis (whole grain bread). The slice on the right has cheese strips and two small cornichons; the slice on the left is spread with mayonnaise but no visible cheese or cornichons. The bread slices appear to be moderately thick and of typical size for a sandwich slice in a Swiss context, roughly the size of a hand palm. A typical slice of whole grain bread like this weighs about 40 to 50 grams depending on thickness. The slices here are not extremely thick but are also not paper-thin. Given the size and density visible, I estimate each slice to be around 45 grams, making the total weight for both slices approximately 90 grams. Since the estimation target is for 'pain bis' as a whole, I consider the pair of slices here as the portion, estimating around 90 grams total."

The image shows a single portion of hazelnut ice cream (glace noisette) placed in a small bowl. The piece appears to be medium-sized, roughly the size of a typical large scoop of ice cream but slightly flattened. Ice cream has a relatively low density compared to denser foods like meat, but this portion still looks substantial. Comparing the portion to the bowl size and the texture, I estimate it weighs roughly between 80 and 110 grams. Given the volume and density, a middle estimate of around 95 grams is reasonable and consistent with typical homemade or artisanal ice cream scoop sizes."

The target food item is 'pomme', which is the red apple shown next to the croissant de sils on a wooden table. The apple appears to be of medium size, typical for Swiss apples, roughly fitting in a person's palm. Using the croissant as a reference for scale — which appears to be a medium-sized croissant about 70-80 grams — the apple looks slightly smaller in bulk but denser. A medium apple generally weighs between 150 and 180 grams. Given the visible size and comparing it to the croissant, the apple is fully intact and looks fresh with water droplets, indicating normal density without shriveling. Therefore, it's reasonable to estimate the weight to be around 160 to 180 grams. Choosing a final value in the middle range, I estimate the apple's weight to be about 170 grams."

Each slice looks uniform and there are approximately 15 visible carrot pieces. Cooked carrots have a relatively high water content and density but are smaller in weight than raw carrots for the same volume. Considering the average weight of a cooked carrot slice is about 8-10 grams depending on thickness and size, and with about 15 slices visible, it is reasonable to estimate the total weight of the carrots between 120-160 grams. Given the portion appears medium-sized but not large, I choose a final estimate toward the middle of the range at 140 grams as a sensible and plausible weight estimate for the carrots on the plate."

The target food item is 'maréchal', which visually corresponds to the small yellow cheese cubes placed on the plate near the cucumber slices and salad leaves. There are about five small cubes of cheese visible. Each cube appears to be roughly 1.5 cm on each side, and considering the density of a typical semi-hard cheese like Maréchal (a Swiss cheese type), each cube is likely around 10-12 grams. Multiplying by five cubes gives a range of approximately 50-60 grams. Since the cubes look uniform and not cut very thick, this is a reasonable estimate. Compared to the other food items on the plate (two boiled eggs, leafy salad, and cucumber slices), the cheese portion is moderate but not large. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'maréchal' cheese to be around 55 grams, safely within the 50-60 grams range."

Each slice appears to be about average medium thickness, roughly 1.5 cm thick and around 10 cm in length and 6-7 cm wide. A typical slice of rustic seeded bread in Switzerland weighs approximately 40-50 grams, depending on thickness and density. Given these slices are not particularly thick but also not very thin, they seem to fall in the medium range. The small broken crust piece on the plate is negligible in weight and can be ignored. Therefore, estimating each slice weighs between 40 and 50 grams, the total for three slices would be 120 to 150 grams. The weight for just one slice (the estimation target) is best placed around 45 grams, comfortably in the middle of this range."

The food item to estimate is 'salami'. In the image, the salami is presented as several thin slices piled lightly on the plate, next to two radishes and an open sandwich with ham. The slices appear small, similar to typical dry salami cured slices, about 3-4 cm in diameter and moderately thin, with some visible white fat content. There are around 6 slices, including one broken piece. Each slice roughly weighs about 8-10 grams based on density and size typical for salami. Multiplying by the number of slices, the total weight likely falls between 45 and 60 grams. Considering portion size is modest but not overly small, a reasonable estimate would be about 53 grams. This fits plausibly with the plate size and other food amounts visible."

The specified food item is 'raviolis a la courge' which are visible on the plate as six medium-sized ravioli pieces. Each ravioli appears plump but typical for filled pasta with squash (courge) filling. Given their size relative to the cherry tomatoes and shredded iceberg lettuce, each ravioli likely weighs around 15-20 grams. Six pieces would thus weigh between 90 to 120 grams. Considering some space inside filled pasta and moisture content, the total estimated weight is approximately 105 grams, a medium portion size matching typical Swiss servings for filled pasta dishes."

The image shows one whole apple ('pomme'), which is red and round with a small stem. It appears to be a small to medium-sized apple based on the visible surface area and the shadow size compared to the texture of the table. Typically, a medium-sized apple in Switzerland weighs around 150-180 grams. This apple looks slightly smaller than average, closer to a small-medium size rather than large. Considering this visual assessment, the weight range could be around 120-140 grams. I estimate the weight of this apple to be approximately 130 grams, as it fits best in the small-medium range."

The image shows a galette wrap laid flat on a plate with several toppings including vegetables. The tomatoes are present as two wedges on the top half of the wrap. Each tomato wedge appears fresh, juicy, and of medium size typical of fresh tomatoes sliced into quarters. Given that a whole medium tomato weighs about 120-150 grams, two wedges (approximately half of a tomato) would weigh roughly 60-75 grams. Considering some moisture loss from the cut, a plausible weight range is 55-70 grams. Based on visual size relative to other ingredients like the sliced avocado and carrots, I estimate the weight of the tomatoes to be 63 grams."

The image shows a plate with several food items, among which the piece of poulet (chicken) is clearly visible in the lower center of the plate. The piece looks like a chicken breast portion, cooked with some sauce visible underneath. Judging by the size relative to the fries and salad on the same plate, the chicken breast appears to be medium-sized, roughly the size of an adult hand palm. The thickness looks moderate, typical of a single portion piece of chicken breast without bone. Considering common Swiss portion sizes for chicken breast servings, which typically range from 100 to 150 grams, and given the visible dimensions and thickness, I estimate the weight of this poulet piece to be around 130 grams. The plausible range is approximately 110 to 150 grams based on average portion size and visual appearance. This is consistent with the portion sizes of the other items and the plate size."

The galette millet maïs haricots noirs is the two compact round patties located in the bottom middle of the container. Each galette is roughly the size of a small cookie, about 6-7 cm in diameter and about 1.5 cm thick. Millet and black beans together make a fairly dense mixture, but the galettes are not very thick. Given their size, shape, and ingredients, a typical single galette of this size would weigh about 50-60 grams. Since there are two galettes, the total weight should be around 100-120 grams. Visually, they are medium portions, not overly thick or large, so I estimate the total weight of both galettes combined to be approximately 110 grams."

The image shows a bowl containing a salad of chopped tomatoes and fresh onions on one side, and several small patties on the other side. The patties correspond to the 'galettes millet, haricots noirs, maïs' and appear to be roughly 5 in number. Each galette has a diameter of about 6-7 cm and a thickness of about 1-1.5 cm, with some charred parts visible. Considering their density (made from millet, black beans, and corn) which is moderately dense, and the visible size and thickness, an average galette likely weighs between 40-50 grams. Multiplying by 5 galettes, the total weight range is approximately 200-250 grams. Given their size and the usual recipe consistency, I estimate the total weight at around 230 grams. This fits well within the portion size and relative volume compared to the tomatoes and onions, which appear lighter and less dense."

The image shows a plate with two distinct portions: salad ('salade') on the left and risotto on the right. The salad consists mainly of leaf lettuce with some sunflower seeds scattered on top, adding slight weight. The salad portion covers roughly a third of the plate's surface area, with leaves loosely piled and some depth visible but not densely packed. Leaf lettuce is low density and light, even when considering the slight bunching. Typically, a salad portion of this visible size with some seeds weighs between 50 and 70 grams. Since this is a medium portion of salad, neither very small nor overflowing, I estimate the salad weight to be about 60 grams. This is consistent given the size relative to the plate, light density of leafy greens, and the visible amount of seeds."

The image shows a plate with 'chips vaya beans,' which appear as thin, crisp chips that are somewhat irregularly shaped with visible bits of green and purple, indicating the presence of beans. The chips cover a medium-sized plate's base, piled moderately but not heaping. Given the thinness and texture, these chips are light in density compared to typical tortilla chips. Comparing the size to the plate, the portion looks like a typical single snack serving, somewhere between 25 to 40 grams. Considering the volume and light nature, an estimated weight range of 30-35 grams seems reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'chips vaya beans' portion here to be 33 grams."

The image shows four Blevita crackers stacked on top of each other. Blevita crackers are known for being thin and lightweight. A single standard Blevita cracker typically weighs around 12 grams. Since there are four crackers stacked here, and all appear to be whole and intact, the total weight would be approximately 4 times 12 grams, which is 48 grams. The color or variety of cracker does not significantly affect weight. Therefore, the estimated weight for the four Blevita crackers visible in the image is about 48 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread on a plate. The bottom slice is the tartine mélasse + beurre that is the target for estimation. The slice is medium-sized, typical of a rustic or artisanal bread, and appears to be approximately 12-14 cm in length and 5-6 cm in width. The tartine has a moderate, thin layer of butter and a visible glossy layer of molasses spread on top. Considering the density and weight of the bread slice itself, which likely weighs around 50-60 grams, plus the thin layer of butter (approximately 5-7 grams) and molasses (about 5-7 grams), the total estimated weight of this tartine mélasse + beurre is in the range of 60 to 75 grams. Given the visual evidence and the distribution of toppings, a final estimate of 68 grams seems reasonable and balanced within this range."

The image shows a mostly empty plate with only a small portion of pizza remaining. This slice appears to be about one-eighth to one-tenth of a standard pizza size, given its dimensions relative to the plate and cutlery. The crust is of medium thickness, and there are a few mushrooms and some sauce and cheese visible as toppings. The density of the pizza slice is moderate, with typical weight contributed by the dough and toppings. A standard whole pizza in Switzerland typically weighs around 300-400 grams, so one slice would weigh roughly between 30 to 40 grams. Given the small leftover portion and some missing bites, I estimate the remaining piece weighs around 30 grams. The plausible weight range considering the size and toppings would be 25-35 grams."

The salade de céleri (celery salad) is located at the bottom right of the plate. It appears as a grated celery root mixed with some dressing, forming a small mound. The portion size is modest compared to the other items on the plate. Given that celery root is dense but grated finely, this portion likely weighs less than denser meat portions and potato salad. Considering the size of the plate and the visual volume of the celery salad, I estimate a weight range of about 60 to 90 grams. Since it is a medium-sized serving typical of a side salad in Switzerland, a value near the middle of this range is most plausible. Therefore, I estimate the weight to be approximately 75 grams."

The image shows six pieces of pear ('poire') in a transparent plastic container. The pieces are roughly medium-sized chunks, with some skin left on and some browning spots visible. The container size and the pear pieces' relative size to the fingers and pants fabric underneath suggest that these are from a medium-sized pear. A whole medium pear typically weighs around 150-180 grams. Given that these pieces look like most of the fruit, I estimate the total weight to be around 140-160 grams, accounting for some loss due to peeling and cutting. Thus, a good estimate for the weight of the pear chunks here is about 150 grams."

The image shows a red plate with two distinct foods: a portion of risotto and a small serving of salad (salade). The salade is a small portion placed near the risotto, consisting mainly of leafy greens and some visible small bits of other vegetables or dressing. The salade portion looks compact but not piled high, roughly covering an area about 7-8 cm wide and 3-4 cm thick considering the slight layering. Typical leaf salads with light dressing have low density, so their weight is relatively low despite volume. Given the size relative to the risotto and common Swiss side salad portions, the salade appears to be a small side serving roughly between 30 and 50 grams. Estimating the portion as medium-small, I choose a weight around 40 grams. This fits with the visual minimal volume on the plate and the texture of leafy salad components."

The image shows a single slice of 'tarte aux fraises' on a dessert plate. The slice includes a biscuit or pastry crust base, a generous layer of creamy filling, and several large strawberry halves on top, as well as some redcurrants embedded in the cream. The strawberries are substantial in size, typical of fresh strawberries, and there are about 7 halves visible. The cream layer looks thick but not overly dense, and the pastry base is crumbly with a few crumbs on the plate. Given the size relative to the plate and the thickness of different layers, this slice appears to be a medium portion. Typical strawberry tortes with cream and pastry crust usually weigh between 120 and 160 grams for a medium slice. Considering the volume of strawberries and cream observed here, I estimate the slice weighs around 140 grams. This fits well with typical single-serving dessert sizes and the visible composition without over or underestimating the density and volume of the components."

The salade de carotte, mais, tomates is located at the top part of the plate. It appears as a mixed salad with shredded carrot, corn kernels, and halved cherry tomatoes. The portion size is roughly a moderate scoop, occupying about one sixth of the plate, with visible volume but not densely packed. The carrot is shredded finely, making it less dense by volume, but the corn adds more weight due to its small kernels. The cherry tomatoes are halved and there are about 7-9 visible halves or pieces, each roughly 5-7 grams raw. The shredded carrot and corn mixture combined appears to weigh more than just the volume might suggest due to density of corn and moist carrot. Considering the overall visual volume and density, I estimate the weight of the salad to be between 90 and 130 grams. Taking a medium value within this range to reflect the moderate portion size, the estimate is around 110 grams."

The image shows a plate with three food items: white rice, a portion of cooked fish (poisson), and sautéed vegetables consisting mainly of carrots and leeks (légumes sautés). The sautéed vegetables cover a moderate portion on the right side of the plate. The volume appears to be a medium serving, with visible chunks of carrots and leeks distributed evenly. The vegetables have softened from cooking but still retain some bulk; therefore, their density is moderate. Considering the plate size and comparing the vegetables' volume to the rice and fish portions, the vegetable portion appears to be around 150-200 grams. Taking into account the slightly compressed and cooked nature of the vegetables, the final estimated weight for the sautéed vegetables is about 175 grams."

The target food is 'pâtes' (pasta), which is clearly visible at the bottom of the plate as a single portion of twisted pasta (fusilli). The portion size is medium, filling about one-third of the plate's surface but with some depth, suggesting a moderate volume. Pâte portions in Switzerland typically average around 120 to 160 grams cooked per serving. Considering the visible volume against the other items (red kidney beans and green beans), which are smaller in portion, and noting the pasta is not piled too high, a plausible range could be 130-160 grams. Given the density and cooked state of the pasta, I estimate the pasta portion here to be about 145 grams. This fits the medium portion size visually consistent with the plate contents and does not over or underestimate relative to the other items."

The image shows a plate with a mixed salad containing various ingredients including rice, cherry tomatoes, peach pieces, corn, asparagus, tuna, red kidney beans, and a boiled egg (oeuf). The boiled egg is visible on the right side of the plate, cut in half. The typical weight of a medium-sized boiled egg in Switzerland, including white and yolk, is approximately 50 grams. Since both halves are present and appear to be the whole egg, the portion corresponds to a full boiled egg. Considering the size relative to the plate and other ingredients, 50 grams is a plausible and accurate estimate for this boiled egg portion."

The hummous is visible in the lower left part of the plate as a small scoop of creamy beige paste. It occupies a small area roughly equivalent to a tablespoon or slightly larger. Comparing it with the other items on the plate for scale, such as olives and strawberries nearby, the hummous portion looks like a modest serving typical for a single snack sized helping. Generally, a tablespoon of hummous weighs around 15 to 20 grams. Given the visual fullness and area covered, I estimate the hummous portion to be between 18 and 25 grams. Choosing a final value slightly above midpoint to account for the slight heap and thickness of the hummous, I estimate about 22 grams. This is plausible in relation to the other items and overall plate arrangement."

The salade verte is located at the lower right portion of the plate and consists of leafy greens coated lightly with dressing. The portion is small to medium, roughly covering an area equivalent to a small handful, with some volume due to the layering of leaves. Considering the low density of lettuce and the visible dressing contributing some slight weight, the plausible weight range is between 30 to 50 grams. Given the moderate fullness and the amount on the plate relative to the other foods, a final estimate towards the middle of this range at approximately 40 grams is reasonable. This aligns well with typical side salad servings in Swiss contexts and matches the visual size compared to the other items on the plate."

The sprouts are located mainly in the center of the bowl above the spinach leaves and below some sliced tomatoes. They appear to be loose, light in density, and occupy a roughly circular area about 7-8 cm diameter and about 1.5-2 cm depth. Given that sprouted seeds are very light and airy but somewhat compacted here, I estimate the volume around 50-60 ml. Typical density for such sprouts would be approximately 0.15-0.20 g/ml due to water content and loose structure. This would give a weight range roughly between 7.5 grams (50 ml x 0.15) and 12 grams (60 ml x 0.20). Considering the visual fullness and presence of some thicker sprouts, I would choose a middle estimate close to 10 grams. This is consistent with the size compared to the spinach leaves and tomatoes, which helps verify the scale. Therefore, the estimated weight of the pousses de graines in this serving is about 10 grams."

The 'salade' on the plate consists of mixed green leaves, visible carrot slices, and chunks of avocado, dressed with a small amount of olive oil and vinegar. The salad portion is a moderate heap on the plate, spanning roughly one-third of the plate's surface area. Given the density of leafy greens, carrots, and the heavier avocado pieces, plus the added dressing increasing mass slightly, the salad seems a medium-sized serving. Considering the inclusion of avocado which is relatively dense and the volume of lettuce and carrots, the total weight is likely in the range of 120 to 170 grams.

The item is a processed chocolate product with a rough textured surface due to added ingredients like nuts or crisped rice, typical of chocolate bars or sticks available in Switzerland. From the scale given by the wooden grain size and the thickness of the stick, it appears to be about 12-14 cm long and about 2-3 cm in diameter, resembling common chocolate sticks such as the 'Branche de Suchard'. Known weights for such items are around 35-50 grams. This piece appears intact and of a standard size, not broken or missing parts. Given the density of milk chocolate combined with inclusions, a reasonable weight range would be 40-50 grams. Selecting a middle value to be precise, I estimate the weight of the 'branche de chocolat' to be approximately 45 grams."

Comparing to the other items on the plate, the portion size looks moderate but not large, roughly occupying about one-sixth of the plate surface. Pasta is voluminous but less dense, so the visual volume should be converted appropriately to weight. Given the size of a standard dinner plate (around 25 cm diameter), and the portion shown, the pasta salad likely weighs between 70 to 110 grams. Considering the moderate portion—neither very small nor full-sized—and factoring in some dressing that adds modest weight, a reasonable estimate would be about 90 grams for the pasta salad."

The portions look to be from roughly half of a medium-sized red bell pepper, considering typical Swiss portion sizes and the relative size compared to the adjacent chicken pieces and avocado slices. A full medium bell pepper weighs about 120-150 grams fresh; cooking reduces water content, making the weight slightly less. Given the sautéed appearance and the amount visible (about half of the pepper), I estimate the weight range to be between 50 and 70 grams. A midpoint estimate of about 60 grams fits well with the portion size and visual density."

The image shows a black plate with a serving of spaghetti topped with pesto and sprinkled with gruyère cheese. The spaghetti portion appears medium-sized, loosely piled, and roughly covers most of the plate surface. Typical dry weight for a medium cooked spaghetti portion in Switzerland ranges between 80 to 120 grams; since these are cooked, the weight is higher due to water absorption, approximately 180 to 220 grams. Considering the visible quantity, the spaghetti here seems to be around 200 grams. The pesto and gruyère are present but the estimate is strictly for spaghetti. Given the depth and volume on the plate, 200 grams is a reasonable estimate for the cooked spaghetti portion."

The image shows a single galette wrap spread with demi crème acidulée, topped with slices of avocado, grated carrots, sliced tomatoes, a slice of ham, and grated Gruyère. The avocado is located at the top right section of the wrap and consists of approximately two medium-width slices. Given the average weight of an avocado is around 200-250 grams in total, and typically an avocado is sliced into about 6-8 slices, two slices represent roughly a quarter of the avocado. Avocado slices are dense and contain skin in the visible parts, but here only the inner flesh is visible, so no skin is included. A quarter avocado weighs around 50-60 grams when peeled and sliced. Considering the thickness and size of the slices visible, I estimate the avocado portion on this wrap to be approximately 55 grams, with a plausible range from 45 to 65 grams based on slice size and thickness."

The image shows two small pieces of rustic bread on a plate. Each piece has a modest thickness and appears partially eaten or cut. The bread slices are about 8-10 cm long and look typical for Swiss rustic bread. Each piece is fairly airy with visible holes. Considering the density of typical European-style rustic bread, one slice of this size generally weighs between 30 and 50 grams. Since the two pieces are about half or slightly less than a full normal slice each, combined they roughly make up the equivalent of one full slice of bread weighing approximately 40 grams. Therefore, I estimate the combined weight of the two 'pain' slices to be around 40 grams."

The image shows a plate of spaghetti pasta topped with sauce bolognese and a generous amount of grated cheese. The target food item is sauce bolognese, which is visible as a reddish-brown thick meat sauce placed centrally on the pasta. The portion of sauce bolognese covers a significant surface area approximately 12-15 cm wide and is moderately thick, but not overly piled. It looks like a typical homemade bolognese sauce portion served on pasta. Comparing the sauce portion to the pasta and the plate size (standard dinner plate around 25 cm in diameter) helps estimate volume. A medium portion of sauce bolognese like this, spread evenly but with some thickness, likely weighs between 100 grams (if spread thin) and 140 grams (if denser and thicker). Considering this is a normal single serving on pasta, I estimate the sauce bolognese weight at approximately 120 grams as a reasonable midpoint within the range."

The scrambled eggs ('oeufs brouillés') are located on the upper left side of the plate. They appear as a loose, fluffy pile with some visible moisture and volume. The portion covers roughly one-third of the plate surface area. The plate is a standard medium size, approximately 24 cm in diameter, which provides a reference scale. Regarding density, scrambled eggs are somewhat airy but still dense compared to vegetables. The portion looks like it was made with about 2 to 3 eggs, common for a single meal. Typical cooked egg weight per egg is around 50 grams, so the weight range for this portion is about 100 to 150 grams. Given some fluffiness and cooking loss, a final estimate near the middle of this range is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the scrambled eggs weigh approximately 130 grams."

The image shows a single slice of rhubarb tart on a white plate with a standard-sized fork and knife for scale. The slice covers roughly a quarter of a typical tart size, which typically weighs around 300-350 grams when whole. The rhubarb pieces are visible and embedded in a custard-like filling on a pastry crust. Considering the density and volume of the ingredients, and that the slice is about one quarter of a normal tart, the weight should be around 80 to 95 grams. Given the visible thickness and rhubarb quantity, I estimate the slice to weigh approximately 90 grams."

The image shows a white bowl partially filled with two different grains or seeds side by side. On the right side of the bowl, the flocon d'avoines (oat flakes) are visible as a moderately sized pile. They occupy about half the horizontal space of the bowl bottom, with a modest depth that is roughly level with the flax seeds on the left. Given the size of the bowl (appears to be a typical small cereal bowl) and the density of dry oat flakes, the volume visible corresponds to a small to medium portion. A typical tablespoon of oat flakes weighs around 7-8 grams, and visually this looks like about 3 to 4 tablespoons of oat flakes. Therefore, the plausible weight range is roughly 20 to 32 grams. Considering the visual fullness and compactness, I estimate the flocon d'avoines weight at about 28 grams. This estimate is consistent with the relative proportions shown and the fact that oat flakes are light but slightly dense when measured in this volume."

The image shows a black plate with two slices of tomato omelette and a single slice of brown bread (pain). The bread slice covers a large part of the plate and appears to be a single standard slice of whole grain or mixed grain bread typically found in Swiss households. Compared to the size of the omelette pieces and the plate, the bread slice looks moderately thick and dense. A standard slice of this type of bread generally weighs between 30 and 40 grams, depending on thickness. This slice appears of medium thickness, so estimating in the middle of this range is appropriate. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the slice of bread as approximately 35 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing cooked pâtes, aubergines, carottes, and fromage gruyère. The carottes appear as thin slices and julienne-style strips mixed in with the other vegetables and pasta. Visually, the carotte pieces cover a modest area of the bowl, mainly on the left and top edges, but the density is low as they are thinly sliced. Considering the bowl size relative to the visible table surface and the proportion of carottes compared to the other vegetables, the total carotte mass looks to be small to medium sized. A typical thin slice of cooked carrot weighs about 5 grams, and there are approximately 8-10 visible slices or pieces accounting for layering and some obscured portions. Thus, the carottes likely weigh between 40 and 60 grams. Choosing a mid-range value for this modest portion size, I estimate the carottes weight at about 50 grams."

The image shows fresh spinach leaves spread across the bottom left and center parts of a square white bowl. The spinach leaves are whole, fresh, and relatively flat, covering a moderate surface area but not piled very thickly. Considering the nature of fresh spinach, which is light and low density, the visible amount appears to be a medium portion suitable for a salad bowl. Compared to the size of the cherry tomatoes (cut to halves, about 2-3 cm long) and the falafel balls (about 3-4 cm diameter each), the spinach layer is thin but covers a good area. A light, fresh spinach serving typically weighs less than it looks due to leaf volume and airiness. Given the visible quantity and typical Swiss portion sizes for fresh spinach in salads, I estimate the weight range between 30 and 50 grams. As the spinach is not piled and looks reasonably spread, I choose a final estimate towards the middle at about 40 grams, which aligns well with the visual volume and density of fresh spinach."

The pasta portion covers about one third of the container and consists of rotini pasta with some tomato-based sauce, topped with a modest layer of grated Parmesan. Considering the size of the container (roughly a standard meal prep container) and the portion size, this pasta portion looks like a medium serving, neither small nor overly large. Typical cooked pasta weight in such a portion is about 140-180 grams. Given the presence of sauce and some compaction, a realistic range would be 150 to 170 grams. I estimate the weight of the pasta itself (excluding Parmesan) to be about 160 grams. This estimate aligns with the visible volume and makes sense relative to the other components, which are smaller in volume, consistent with common meal portioning in Switzerland."

The mayonnaise is located on the left side of the plate as a creamy dollop of white sauce. It appears as a moderate portion, not a very small dollop but not an extremely large serving either. Mayonnaise is dense and creamy, so its volume aligns closely with its mass.

Considering the size of the container, which can be compared to common lunchbox dimensions around 15cm in length and 10cm wide, the tomato portion looks like roughly half a medium tomato or around 2-3 slices. Tomatoes have a high water content and thus low density, so the mass is less than it appears volume-wise. A medium tomato typically weighs about 120-150g; half would then be around 60-75g. Given the chopped state and portion size seen, a reasonable weight range for these tomato pieces is about 50-70 grams. I estimate the weight to be 60 grams, as it looks like a moderate amount but not very large."

Given the size of the eggs relative to the pasta and the plate, they look like standard large eggs typically used in Switzerland. A large cooked egg without shell usually weighs around 50 grams each. Since there are two eggs visible, the total weight should be approximately double that. Considering slight loss or gain in cooking, the reasonable weight range for the two eggs combined would be about 90-110 grams. I therefore estimate the total weight of the eggs on the plate to be approximately 100 grams."

Butter is dense and heavy relative to volume, so even a small piece weighs noticeably. Given the relative size compared to the bread slice and cheese pieces, and that butter slices served for spreading tend to be between 10 to 15 grams, this piece looks toward the lower middle of this range due to its modest thickness. I estimate a plausible weight range between 10 to 14 grams, with a final estimate of 12 grams being reasonable and consistent with typical serving portions of butter on a plated meal."

The sauce vinaigrette is visible as a light dressing scattered mainly on top of the tofu, shredded carrots, and some surrounding vegetables. Since vinaigrette is a liquid dressing, it appears in thin layers rather than a thick portion, and the container itself shows no puddles or pools of sauce. Judging from the appearance and the typical use of vinaigrette in such a mixed vegetable and grain dish, the total visible amount is likely around 1 to 2 tablespoons, which corresponds roughly to 15-30 grams. Considering the relatively light but evenly spread visible quantity, a reasonable estimate would be toward the lower middle of this range, about 20 grams."

The piece of butter appears as a small slab on the plate, roughly 2x3 cm in surface area and about 1 cm thick. Given the approximate size and typical density of butter (about 0.95 g/cm³), and comparing it to the size of the bread crisps and slices of meat on the plate, this portion of butter looks to be a small serving likely intended for spreading on the bread. A small butter serving of this size usually weighs between 10 to 15 grams. Given the size and thickness, I estimate the butter portion to be around 12 grams. This fits visually as a modest butter portion which is common with small grilled bread pieces."

The image shows a portion of risotto aux asperges on a plate, with visible pieces of asparagus and creamy, cooked rice grains. The risotto portion looks medium-sized, spreading over about half the plate's inner area, with some modest depth visible. Given the typical density of risotto (cooked rice + creamy sauce + asparagus), portions can be somewhat dense but not overly heavy per volume. A medium serving of risotto on such a plate would generally weigh between 180 and 230 grams. Because the portion is neither very small nor very large, and considering Swiss portion norms, a midpoint estimate of 200 grams is appropriate for the risotto itself. Parmesan, if sprinkled on top or mixed in, is not visually dominant and thus its weight is considered negligible and part of the overall risotto weight. Therefore, the estimated weight for the parmesan component alone is small. Standard servings of parmesan as garnish typically range from 5-10 grams on risotto. The visual evidence suggests a light sprinkling rather than a thick layer, closer to about 7 grams. This fits plausibly with the visible amount and common serving customs."

The image shows a small piece of bread ('pain') with a layer of chestnut cream ('crème de marrons') spread on its surface. The bread piece is modestly sized, around 10 cm long and 3-4 cm wide, with a typical density for crusty bread. The chestnut cream layer, though glossy and spread generously, appears to be thin to medium thickness, covering the bread partially. Given the size and visible coverage, the crème de marrons portion looks like about 1 to 1.5 tablespoons, which generally weighs between 15 and 25 grams. Considering the depth of spread and coverage area, a realistic weight range for the crème de marrons here is 18 to 22 grams. I select 20 grams as a balanced estimate within this range. This estimate also aligns with the appearance relative to the bread size and does not overestimate spread thickness."

The image shows two slices of bread on a white plate, each spread with a different topping. One slice has a light brown, semi-transparent spread identified as mélasse (molasses). The slice is about the size of a typical bread slice, which in Switzerland often weighs between 40 to 50 grams per slice. The visible amount of mélasse covers roughly half of the slice, with a thin to moderate layer. Molasses is dense but applied thinly, so the total weight of the spread is relatively small. Given the coverage and typical spread thickness, the amount of mélasse appears to be around 10-15 grams. Considering the spread coverage but not excessively thick, and molasses density, I estimate the mélasse weight to be about 12 grams."

The specified food item is 'graine de chia' (chia seeds), which are clearly visible mixed within the jar contents. The jar contains multiple ingredients including yogurt, oats, honey, and almond puree, but the chia seeds appear as distinct small black seeds dispersed throughout. Given the dense appearance and typical concentration of chia seeds in such a preparation, the total amount can be estimated by considering how much volume the seeds typically take in a jar of this size (medium jar around 250-300 ml). Chia seeds are very light; 1 tablespoon (~12 grams) can spread through this volume quite visibly as seen here. The visible amount corresponds roughly to 10-15 grams in the jar. Considering the partial visibility and the depth likely filled, a reasonable estimate is about 12 grams for the chia seeds. This aligns well with typical portions and the visible distribution in the jar mixture."

The image shows a single slice of white bread ('pain') on a plate. The bread appears to be a small to medium-sized slice, roughly similar to common Swiss white bread slices. Typically, such a slice weighs between 25 and 40 grams depending on thickness and density. Considering the slice here is not very thick and is somewhat airy with visible holes, it suggests a lighter bread type. Therefore, a reasonable portion weight estimate would be between 30 and 35 grams for this slice. I estimate the weight of the slice of bread to be approximately 32 grams."

The image shows four small slices of bread each spread with a thin layer of butter ('beurre') underneath a layer of strawberry jam. The butter is not heavily applied — it looks like a light spread covering most of the bread surface but thin enough to see the texture underneath. Each slice appears to have roughly 2-3 grams of butter based on typical spread thickness and slice size (which is about 8-10 cm long, similar to a small Swiss bread roll slice). Multiplying by four slices, the total butter weight is roughly between 8 and 12 grams. Considering the light spread and visual thinness, a precise estimate is around 10 grams. This estimate fits well with the visible portion and is consistent with typical portion sizes for butter on bread in Switzerland."

The image shows a white bowl containing a mixture of blanc battu, flocons d'avoine, graines de chia, and miel. The graines de chia are visible as many small black seeds dispersed throughout the mixture. As these seeds are small and sprinkled thinly across the mixture, their total volume is low compared to the other ingredients. Typically, a serving of chia seeds in such a mixture is around 10-15 grams. Given the visible concentration and the size of the bowl portion, the total amount of graines de chia is likely about 12-14 grams. This range accounts for the visible seed density and the typical usage in similar dishes. Therefore, I estimate the weight of graines de chia at approximately 13 grams."

The image shows a bowl containing a creamy mixture with visible chia seeds evenly mixed in, which corresponds to the combination of sére maigre, graines de chia, and purée de noisettes. The food appears thick and dense, typical for a dairy-based preparation mixed with nut butter and seeds. The bowl is medium-sized and the mixture fills about half to two-thirds of it. Given that typical portions of sére maigre in such preparations range between 150 to 200 grams, and considering the additional bulk from nut butter and chia seeds, the weight of the sére maigre alone should be somewhat less due to the added ingredients. The mixture appears smooth and uniform, so a good estimate for the weight of the sére maigre alone in this portion is around 140 to 160 grams. Choosing a middle value, I estimate the sére maigre content at approximately 150 grams."

The mozzarella is visible as a single dollop placed on top of the cooked pasta. It appears to be a fresh, soft type of mozzarella (likely a burrata or ricotta-style), creamy in texture and not formed into slices. The portion size looks moderate — approximately the size of a large spoonful or small scoop. Considering the density and moisture content of fresh mozzarella, such a portion generally weighs between 40 and 60 grams. The plate portioning shows a balanced meal with the pasta, green beans, and kidney beans, which helps confirm that this is not a tiny garnish nor a large, full mozzarella ball. The visible mozzarella amount likely weighs about 50 grams, which fits well within the expected portion size for a topping like this."

The image shows a parfait-style glass containing several components. The biscuit pieces are visible on top of the ice cream, appearing as broken shards of a thin, flaky biscuit or wafer. The biscuit is likely a light, crispy type with low density, and the shards combined cover the top surface of the ice cream but only in a thin layer. There seem to be several pieces, but none are thick or very large. Considering their size relative to the glass rim and the ice cream scoop, and accounting for the flakiness and density of the biscuit, I estimate the total biscuit weight to be modest. A typical light biscuit shard portion topping a dessert like this would weigh between 8 and 15 grams. Given the number and size of shards, I estimate the biscuit weight at about 12 grams. This fits the visual impression where the biscuit is a garnish rather than the main component."

The image shows a single slice of tresse bread with a thin layer of butter spread over it. The butter coverage is partial and fairly thin, not overly thick or piled. Given common Swiss portion sizes, a thin spread of butter on a slice of bread typically weighs between 5 and 10 grams. Considering the visible thin spread and the moderate surface area coverage, the plausible range is around 6 to 8 grams. Therefore, the estimated weight of the butter on this slice is approximately 7 grams."

The image shows a plate with several distinct food items, including a cluster of black olives at the bottom and some drizzle or small amount of oil on the olives that could be the 'huile de lin' (linseed oil). Typically, linseed oil would be used as a dressing or drizzled over food, appearing as a thin glossy layer or small pool of oil on or around the ingredients. There is no visible bottle or container, and the oil is likely minimal in quantity due to its strong flavor and typical usage as a condiment rather than a main ingredient. Given the visual appearance and typical usage amounts, the amount of linseed oil on the plate looks to be roughly equivalent to a small teaspoon or less. A teaspoon of oil weighs about 4.5 grams. Since the amount here looks small but clearly visible, not overly abundant, a reasonable estimation range would be 3-6 grams. Selecting a middle ground value for a modest drizzle, I estimate the linseed oil weight to be approximately 5 grams."

The image shows two slices of rustic bread on a white plate, one spread with apricot jam and a thin layer of butter, the other with Nutella and butter. Focusing on the 'beurre', the butter is spread thinly on both slices and appears to be approximately 1 to 2mm thick in most areas, covering roughly half to two-thirds of each slice. Considering a standard butter spreading, a thin layer on a slice of bread usually weighs around 5 to 10 grams. Since it is spread lightly and unevenly, I estimate the total quantity of butter on both slices combined to be about 7 grams. This is consistent with the visible coverage and typical portion size for breakfast butter in Switzerland."

The image shows a small piece of a demi croissant with some butter and apricot jam spread on it. The croissant piece is quite small, likely less than half of a full half-croissant portion. Given that a typical full croissant usually weighs around 60-70 grams in Switzerland, half a croissant would be roughly 30-35 grams. This piece is visibly smaller than half; it looks like about one-third or less of a half croissant. Taking into account the visible volume and density of the croissant's flaky, airy texture, plus the thin layers of butter and jam, the estimated weight range would be around 10-15 grams. Based on the size and volume in the image, I estimate the demi croissant piece to weigh approximately 12 grams."

The image shows a single piece of rustic bread ('pain') on a plate, about the size of a medium slice torn from a loaf. Given the visible crust thickness and the porous interior, this piece appears to be roughly 10 cm long and 5-6 cm wide, with moderate thickness. Typical density for this type of bread is around 250-300 grams per 100 grams per slice (considering usual volume). The piece looks like a medium portion, neither extremely thin nor thick. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this single piece of bread to be in the range of 40-60 grams, leaning towards a moderate size at about 50 grams. Since the caviar d'aubergines is spread on top, not altering the bread weight estimation, I focus purely on the bread. This estimation fits the relative size placed on the plate and is consistent with typical Swiss portion sizes for rustic bread slices."

The image shows two slices of bread on a plate, one spread with butter (beurre) and the other with Nutella. The butter is spread thinly but unevenly, covering much of the surface of the bread slice. A typical slice of French-style bread weighs approximately 40-50 grams. The quantity of butter spread appears modest, roughly a thin layer covering the slice, which usually corresponds to about 5-7 grams of butter. Given the visible amount of butter on the slice, I estimate the butter weight to be around 6 grams, within a plausible range of about 5-8 grams considering the spread thickness and coverage. This fits well with common portions for butter on bread in Switzerland, slightly less than a tablespoon."

The image shows a rectangular glass container divided roughly into three sections with épautre cuit (cooked spelt), oeufs brouillés (scrambled eggs), and aubergine au four (baked eggplant). The épautre cuit portion occupies about one-third of the container. The grains appear cooked but not overly watery, maintaining a dense structure. Given the container's visible depth and the amount of grains filling their section, I estimate the weight of the cooked spelt as a medium portion. Typically, a dense cooked grain volume of this size corresponds roughly to 140-180 grams. Considering its compactness and the size relative to the eggs and aubergine, I estimate the épautre cuit weighs approximately 160 grams."

The image shows one folded galette (a flatbread similar to a thin wrap) placed in a metal container. The galette is folded, and one end is partially open revealing some filling inside. The size is about that of a medium wrap, roughly 20-25 cm long and about 10 cm wide when unfolded. The galette appears to be of medium thickness, typical of lavash or similar thin flatbreads. A standard galette of this size and thickness generally weighs between 70 and 120 grams. Given that this galette is folded and partially eaten (open end), the visible part seems to be about three-quarters of a whole galette size. Considering its folded state and thin appearance, I estimate the weight of the galette alone (without the filling) to be around 90 grams, which is a reasonable mid-value within the 70-120 g range. This also aligns with the relative size against the metal container and the thickness visible at the edges."

The image shows a blue plate with three main components: a portion of bulgur, a portion of ratatouille, and two halves of a hard-boiled egg ('œuf dur'). The focus is on the œuf dur. The egg is cut into two halves, clearly visible on the left side of the plate. A standard hard-boiled egg typically weighs around 50 grams whole. Since these are two halves of one egg and appear fully intact (no pieces missing), the total visible amount corresponds to one full egg. Considering the size and thickness visible relative to the fork and knife nearby, this looks like a medium-sized hard-boiled egg typical in Swiss servings. Therefore, the weight of this œuf dur is estimated at approximately 50 grams, within a plausible range of 45 to 55 grams."
