The image shows peeled and chopped raw kohlrabi (colrave crue) pieces on a standard white plastic container lid. The container lid appears to be about 20 cm long and 12 cm wide, a typical size for standard small food containers. The pieces are irregular but moderately thick, averaging about 1-2 cm thick. Considering typical kohlrabi density and the visible volume, I estimate approximately 15-20 pieces visible. Each piece is roughly 25-30 grams by volume and density approximation, given the watery, crunchy nature of kohlrabi. Multiplying 18 pieces by roughly 25 g gives about 450 grams. Cross-checking by volume: the container is filled about 70% on the flat lid surface, with a single layer but moderately thick slices giving roughly 450 g in total. Thus, the 450 g estimate aligns with the visual container size and piece count. This is a reasonably dense vegetable comparable to other root vegetables of similar size. Therefore, the estimated weight of the chopped raw kohlrabi (colrave crue) on this lid is 450 grams."
xjvrtk,tomates cerises,500.0,170,330.0,20.340236686390533,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/5ccbcf64-3631-48df-9e8a-85fb33dbf912,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows cherry tomatoes in a small cardboard tray typically used for retail sale in Switzerland. A standard cherry tomato weighs 8-12 grams. Counting the visible tomatoes, there are around 17 cherry tomatoes in the tray. Estimating an average of 10 grams per tomato is reasonable here. Thus, the total weight would be approximately 17 × 10 = 170 grams. Cross-checking with Swiss typical packaging sizes, a cherry tomato punnet usually weighs around 250 grams, but this container appears less full and smaller than a full 250 g punnet. The tomatoes are also on-the-vine, which might add some extra slight weight to the stems, but that won't be counted. Given the tray is moderately full with these 17 tomatoes and some gaps visible, 170 grams is a plausible estimate and aligns with per-item weight and container size observed."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,100,317.0,16.295488165680474,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The food to estimate is 'salade de tomates', i.e., tomato salad. Visually, the plate (around 26 cm diameter) contains roughly 9 tomato slices and wedges. Considering the typical size and weight of Swiss large tomatoes (120-150 g each), the slices represent about half to two-thirds of a whole tomato. The tomato pieces are relatively thick slices and wedges, roughly filling the depth of the plate but not piled high, just one layer. Assuming about 60-70% of a whole tomato is present, and using 140 g as a medium tomato weight, that gives approximately 98-105 g of tomato in the salad. Cross-checking with volume and density: the plate coverage and thickness match about 100 g. The added flax seeds, oil and balsamic vinegar do not significantly add to tomato weight and are not included in this estimate. Hence, the estimated weight of 'salade de tomates' (tomato portions only) is about 100 grams."

The food item is 'pizza champignons, olives, courgettes'. Visually, the pizza is on a standard white plate, roughly 26 cm in diameter, which helps establish scale. The pizza is sliced into 6 pieces with 5 slices remaining on the plate. The base seems to be a thin to medium crust, typical for a 30 cm pizza. The toppings include mushrooms, black olives, and courgettes. The pizza slices shown have moderate toppings coverage. A full 30 cm pizza in Switzerland typically weighs between 450-550 g. Taking 500 g as a reference for the whole pizza, each of the 6 slices represents about 1/6 of the whole, or approximately 83 g per slice (500 g ÷ 6 ≈ 83 g). The pizza looks as if 5 slices are present, so the total visible pizza weight is 5 × 83 g = 415 g. However, since the request is to estimate the weight of the entire pizza portion visible, we focus on what is present on the plate. This seems correct given the size and thickness. To sanity check, this weight per slice is consistent with Swiss norms for thin-crust vegetable-topped pizza slices (60-90 g). Therefore, the best estimate for the weight of the pizza champignons, olives, courgettes on the plate is about 415 g."
p8a2w5,pillons de poulet,112.0,320,208.0,2.871794871794872,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/bdb25c53-2eb7-4a81-b33e-6d28997d0183,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'pillons de poulet' (chicken drumsticks). There are four small grilled chicken drumsticks visible on the plate. A typical Swiss small cooked chicken drumstick weighs about 70-90 grams depending on size. These drumsticks appear cooked and moderately sized, slightly small by Swiss standards yet not unusually small. Using a mid-range average of 80 grams per drumstick is reasonable. Multiplying 4 drumsticks by 80 grams gives 320 grams. Cross-checking: the four drumsticks together occupy roughly a third of the plate's width, which aligns well with this weight range. Additionally, the drumsticks are grilled without visible heavy breading, so the raw-to-cooked weight loss does not heavily reduce weight from the typical cooked weight. Therefore, 320 grams is a plausible and consistent estimate for the four chicken drumsticks shown."
ppf8hc,carotte,182.0,35,147.0,3.298076923076923,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/586e0d02-4ce2-4d7f-8ebb-a46598eb749c,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The food item to estimate is 'carotte'. Visually, the carrots are cut into medium-thick rounds on a plate approximately 26 cm in diameter. There are around 20 pieces of carrot, each about 1.5-2 cm thick. A typical whole carrot weighs roughly 60-80 grams and is about 15-20 cm long. Given the size of these pieces, they likely represent about half a medium carrot, based on length and thickness. Using the average weight of 70 g per whole carrot, half would be about 35 g. Considering some water loss during cooking and the density of cooked carrot, the weight should not be drastically reduced. The portion does not fill more than half the plate space, but the thickness is consistent with a half carrot cut in slices. Cross-checking with the quinoa-bulgur mixture next to it, which roughly looks like about 80-100 g, further supports this moderate portion size. Thus, the estimate of 35 grams is consistent and plausible based on visual portion size, typical carrot weight, and slice count."
wrah5h,"légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)",198.0,60,138.0,3.3683431952662723,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/5e117510-fc82-4a06-a502-12983d55aac5,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux) portion is shown on the right side of the plate. The plate diameter is about 26 cm, giving a good scale reference. The vegetables are sliced carrots and chopped leeks, sautéed and piled to cover roughly one quadrant of the plate, with some visible thickness indicating a depth of about 1.5 to 2 cm. The portion is well spread but not heaped, and the vegetable density is moderate given the water content of carrots and leeks. Considering the volume (approx. 7 cm x 7 cm footprint) and moderate layering, a volume around 70 to 90 cm3 is plausible. Given the density of cooked vegetables (roughly 0.8 g/cm3), this translates to about 55 to 70 g. To cross-check, the amount looks about one small cooked vegetable side portion, which typically weighs between 50-80 g. Adjusting for some moisture loss during cooking, the estimate leans towards the middle-lower end of this range. Thus, an estimate of about 60 g is appropriate and consistent with the visual evidence and portion size."
xjvrtk,myrtilles,200.0,70,130.0,3.2051282051282053,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/4d153e2f-e2dc-478b-80de-472793d5b51e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries). In the image, the blueberries are contained in a small bowl held in hand. The bowl appears to be of typical small size, roughly 8-10 cm in diameter. Given the hand scale, the depth of the bowl filled with blueberries is about 4-5 cm. Blueberries are about 1-2 g each. By counting visible blueberries, about 40-50 berries can be roughly estimated. Assuming average 1.5 g per berry, the total weight would be about 60-75 g. The bowl appears nearly full but not heaped, so no need to scale up for hidden layers. Using volume estimation, a small bowl of 500 ml half-filled (~250 ml) with blueberries would weigh about 150-200 g, but this seems too high given the visible quantity and size. So the per-item count estimate is more reliable. Cross-checking with Swiss blueberry punnet 125 g (common retail weight), this is about half a punnet, which fits the size here. Therefore, a reasonable final estimate is about 70 g."
xjvrtk,courgette et oignons,300.0,170,130.0,4.8076923076923075,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is ""courgette et oignons"". In the image, this is the cooked vegetable mix on the left side of the container. The container is a small glass box, about 12x12 cm in surface area visible and around 4-5 cm deep as estimated by the visible shadow and the height of the galettes on the right. The courgette (zucchini) pieces are sliced relatively thin and mixed with pieces of onion. The portion occupies roughly half of the container's base area and is filled to about 2.5-3 cm on average, with some gaps visible within the cooked pieces indicating some air and water content. Cooked courgette and onions have lower density than raw vegetables due to water loss but still have significant weight. Using typical densities, cooked courgette and onions combined weigh approximately 150-180 g per 200 ml volume. Here, the visible volume is roughly 12 cm × 6 cm × 3 cm = 216 cm³. Multiplying by 0.8 density (to account for the mix’s sparseness and water content) gives about 170 g. Cross-checking this by visually comparing to a standard vegetable side portion and the overall container size supports this estimate. Therefore, the estimated weight of the courgette et oignons in the container is about 170 grams."

The salade de pâtes is clearly visible on the plate, consisting of cooked curly pasta mixed with vegetables like corn, tomato, and green pepper. The portion size occupies approximately a quarter of the plate's inner surface area. The plate seems to be a standard dinner plate roughly 26 cm in diameter. Based on the visual estimate, the pasta salad appears to have some depth but is not a thick heap, likely around 2-2.5 cm thick underneath the visible surface layer. Typical cooked pasta density is around 250-300 g per cup (about 240 ml), and a portion of about this size on the plate fits roughly half a cup to three-quarters of a cup in volume. Using volume and density estimation: about 150-200 g of cooked pasta salad is plausible. Cross-check by comparing it to other items: the portion is roughly the same footprint as the grated carrot pile but far less compact and denser than the carrot salad, reinforcing the estimate. Hence, the most reasonable estimate for the salade de pâtes weight is about 180 grams."

The specified food item is 'galettes millet haricots noirs maïs'. In the image, these are the five small round patties on the right side of the glass container. Each galette is roughly the size of a large walnut or a small cookie—about 5-6 cm in diameter and about 1.5-2 cm thick. Given their composition (millet, black beans, corn) and texture, they are fairly dense but also contain some air pockets. Typically, millet-corn-bean patties of this size weigh between 40 to 60 grams each. Counting five patties, estimating conservatively around 50 g per patty gives 250 g total. Checking by volume, they fill about half of one side of the standard small glass container (approximate dimensions around 15x10 cm). Considering density and visible portion, the 250 g total estimate aligns well. Cross-checking per-patty weight range and total volume confirms this is plausible. Hence, the estimated weight for these galettes is approximately 250 grams."

We are estimating the weight of 'pain bis' (brown bread). The image shows two slices of pain bis, each about the size of a standard slice of bread (~12 cm by 8 cm). Swiss standard bread slices typically weigh between 40-60 g for conventional sliced bread, but pain bis (a denser whole grain/brown bread) tends to be on the heavier side due to density and grain content. The slices are relatively thick, about 1.5 cm thickness. Given the visual bulk and texture with visible grains, a single slice likely weighs around 60 g. Since two slices are shown, total bread weight would be approximately 120 g. There are other items on top (mayonnaise, cornichons, fromage), but we exclude their weight as requested. Also, the visual size of the bread relative to the hand holding it and the texture confirms a medium-large portion size. Therefore, the estimated weight of the pain bis in the image is about 120 grams."

The specified food is ""pomme"" (apple). In the image, there is one apple next to a croissant on a wooden table. The apple is a typical small to medium Swiss apple, which tends to be somewhat smaller than North American apples. Given the shape and size relative to the croissant, the apple is about 7-8 cm in height and looks dense and fresh. Swiss apples typically weigh between 120-150 grams for medium size. This apple looks slightly smaller than average medium size but not as small as a miniature or snack apple. Comparing it to the croissant which probably weighs around 70-90 grams (typical for croissant size), the apple is definitely heavier. Thus, a reasonable weight estimate for this apple is at the lower end of a medium apple weight range, about 130 grams. Re-estimating with the visual comparison and typical Swiss apple weights confirms this is plausible and within typical range."
wrah5h,pâtes,148.0,230,82.0,1.4960552268244576,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/115dbd14-27ca-4200-a232-fa9f3eb9bad7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'pâtes' (pasta) in a rectangular metal container alongside green beans, grilled chicken, and grated parmesan. The container appears to be a standard meal portion tray, roughly 20 x 13 cm in visible area and about 3-4 cm deep. The pasta occupies about half the container's length and roughly the full width. Its surface is covered with a moderate amount of grated parmesan, which we will exclude from the pasta weight. The pasta type is short twisted fusilli, cooked and lightly sauced. Cooked pasta weight density is about 160-200 g per 100 cm³, but given typical packed meal portions, we will estimate by volume and visual depth. The pasta layer looks roughly uniform, about 2.5-3 cm thick. Volume estimate: 20 cm (length) x 13 cm (width) x 3 cm (depth) = 780 cm³ total container volume; pasta occupies roughly half length (10 cm) so about 10 x 13 x 3 = 390 cm³. Using average cooked pasta density of approx 180 g/100 cm³: 390 cm³ * 1.8 = 702 g is an overestimate, but the container is metal and could appear more voluminous. The pasta looks loosely packed with some tomato sauce, so 600-650 g is more realistic.

Cross-check via portion comparison: Fusilli cooked portions in Swiss meal trays are typically 150-200 g cooked for a main portion. Here, the pasta is dense and the portion quite large, almost half the meal size. The chicken looks about 100-120 g, and green beans about 60-80 g. Pasta visually dominates. Given that, a figure of about 600 g feels too high given typical meal portions; it's more realistic that the pasta portion is closer to 200-250 g as cooked weight.

Re-negotiating by visible volume and typical cooked pasta portion for a meal tray: The container seems shallow and pasta thickness overestimated. Likely pasta layer is closer to 1.5-2 cm thick, so volume about 10 x 13 x 1.75 = 228 cm³. At 180 g/100 cm³, that is about 410 g.

Given the incomplete depth perception and that some sauce and parmesan take volume, estimate a plausible weight of cooked pasta to be approximately 230 g.

Therefore, final dual-check converges to about 230 grams cooked pasta, which is consistent with typical Swiss meal portion sizes."

The specified food item is 'pain' (bread), which appears as three slices on the plate. The slices are cut from a rustic loaf, typical in Switzerland, probably weighing about 40-60 g per slice for bread of this size and density. The slices appear to be moderately thick. There are three slices, with some crust pieces visible, but the large crumb size and density suggest a weight toward the middle-upper range of a typical Swiss bread slice. The plate diameter (standard ~26 cm) allows size calibration. The bread slices fill about one-third of the plate width each, consistent with typical slice sizes. Therefore, estimating each slice at approximately 55 g is reasonable. Three slices multiplied by 55 g leads to about 165 g total bread. Cross-checking with visual bulk and thickness confirms this is plausible and consistent with typical Swiss bread portions."

The image shows a single slice of a strawberry tart (tarte aux fraises) on a plate of about 26 cm diameter, a standard household plate. Visually, this slice is roughly one eighth of a typical whole tart, judging by the size and typical tart slicing. Strawberry tarts usually weigh about 600 to 800 g whole, considering the pastry base, custard or cream filling, and strawberry topping. For estimation, assume a whole tart weighs around 700 g. One eighth of that would be about 700 g / 8 = 87.5 g. The slice on the plate has visible cream, several halved strawberries on top, and a crispy base that looks somewhat thin but crumbly, consistent with a typical portion weight. Cross-checking the strawberry count and filling, each strawberry half can weigh about 10-15 g and the total visible halves amount to about 7 halves (which sums around 75 to 105 g if weighed alone, but given they are halved and with some empty space, actually the actual mass is lower). The pastry base and cream add some weight but less than the strawberries alone. Adjusting for this, an 85-90 g estimate for the slice is plausible and consistent with visual depth and layers. Therefore, the estimated weight of the tart slice here is about 85 grams."

The specified items are galettes millet, haricots noirs, and maïs, all apparently combined in patties. The image shows about five patties on one side of the bowl. Each patty looks thick and dense, with visible corn kernels (maïs) and black beans (haricots noirs) pieces inside the millet base. The patties look homemade and roughly the size of about 7-8 cm diameter each. A typical millet patty of this size with beans and corn would weigh approximately 50-60 g each considering moisture and density similar to dense vegetable patties. With 5 patties visible, total weight should be roughly 5 × 55 g = 275 g. Cross-checking against the bowl size (about 19-20 cm diameter visible, bowl height likely 5-6 cm) and relative volume of patties, this estimate is reasonable. The patties occupy about half the bowl's surface area and around 1.5-2 cm thickness visible, consistent with around 275 g total weight. Hence, the estimated combined weight for galettes millet, haricots noirs, maïs is 275 g."

These slices look to be on the larger side, closer to 60 g each. Since both slices are shown fully and have consistent thickness, the total weight of bread can be estimated as 2 slices × ~60 g = 120 g. Given the image and portion size, 120 g is a reasonable estimate, and it aligns well with the expected size range of Swiss bread slices without appearing too large or too small."

Cooked spaghetti usually weighs around 140-180 grams per typical adult plate serving based on volume and density estimates. Given the visible volume and density, and comparing the pasta thickness and pile size relative to the plate size, the quantity of spaghetti seems to be a standard single serving portion. Cross-checking with typical Swiss cooked portion sizes confirms that around 150 grams is a reasonable estimate for the cooked weight of spaghetti on the plate."

The average weight of a medium-large strawberry in Switzerland is about 20-25 grams. Using size comparison with the bowl and leaves, each strawberry likely weighs around 20 grams. Multiplying by 4 strawberries gives 80 grams approximately. Visual inspection shows no hidden fruits below, and the strawberries are not densely packed, so no need for upward adjustment for hidden layers. Using a sanity check, this total is within plausible weight for this number of strawberries. Therefore, the most accurate estimate for the total weight of the strawberries is 80 grams."

The known standard weight for a Swiss yogurt pot is about 180 g. The pot appears full to the top with natural yogurt, indicating no significant loss or partial consumption. Comparing the yogurt container size to the apple nearby (which looks like a small to medium apple) and the wooden table confirms the scale. The yogurt has a smooth surface, confirming it is filled almost to capacity. Therefore, the best estimate is the full standard pot net weight of 180 g."

Visually, this piece looks like a moderately sized breast fillet, about 12-15 cm long and roughly 6-7 cm wide, with medium thickness (not very thin). It appears fully cooked with some sauce underneath, adding slight volume but no significant weight increase beyond the meat itself. Comparing it to the fries and salad on the plate suggests the serving is a standard single breast portion served in Swiss meals, not a half breast or extra-large size. The portion size is consistent with a typical lunch serving. Also, the overall plate does not suggest oversized food. Cross-validating with standard estimations for chicken breast portions, the estimate falls in the ~150 g range. Therefore, the best estimate for this poulet piece is about 160 grams."
wrah5h,tiramisu,72.0,130,58.0,0.514792899408284,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/7b0475df-5b02-4072-abb9-ef75acf0f031,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two dessert pieces on a plate approximately 26 cm in diameter. The portion on the left is tiramisu. Its size is roughly 12 cm long, 5-6 cm wide, and about 3.5-4 cm thick. Tiramisu is a creamy layered dessert with soaked sponge, mascarpone cream, and dusting. Density is moderate, somewhat like a moist cake or mousse. A typical slice of tiramisu around this size weighs about 100-150 g. Given the length of 12 cm, width about 6 cm, and thickness near 4 cm, and the density, an estimate around 130 g is reasonable for this portion. Cross-checking against the other dessert piece (Forêt Noir) which looks typical portion size (about 100-130 g usually), this size of tiramisu portion is consistent and plausible. No container or packaging is involved, so size and visual thickness guide the estimation. No hidden layers suggest a single-layer visible cake slice. Overall, a weight of about 130 grams for this tiramisu piece is a solid estimate."
m4egh2,myrtilles,96.0,40,56.0,0.6627218934911243,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/9942fa79-be93-458e-b6a9-22fda9333ff4,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries) in a bowl mixed with cereal and yogurt. From the image, the bowl is a standard breakfast bowl, likely around 15 cm in diameter. The mixture fills the bowl to an approximate depth of about 3-4 cm, accounting for the yogurt and cereal mix. Blueberries are visible distributed throughout the mixture; individual blueberries can be counted approximately: about 15-20 blueberries visible on the surface or near surface. Given the blueberries are partly mixed in, some will be below the visible surface, so let's estimate about 1.5 times the visible count, totaling roughly 25-30 blueberries in the bowl. Per Swiss references, a blueberry weighs 1-2 g. Taking the average weight of 1.5 g per blueberry, the total weight is 25 to 30 blueberries × 1.5 g = 37.5 g to 45 g. Cross-checking by volume, the blueberry portion visually corresponds to a small fraction of the total volume (say roughly one quarter) of the bowl's content. The overall quantity of food seems to be around 200-250 g, consistent with a standard breakfast serving, and 40 g of blueberries fits well as a plausible amount for such a serving. Therefore, an accurate estimate would be about 40 g of blueberries."

The specified food item is 'salade de carotte, mais, tomates.' Visually, this is the mixed salad located at the top center of the plate, containing shredded carrots, corn kernels, halved cherry tomatoes, and some green leafy bits. The portion appears to be placed directly on the plate without any container. The plate diameter is about 26 cm (standard size), helping estimate the salad volume. The salad covers roughly a circular area about 8-10 cm in diameter, with an approximate thickness of around 1.5 - 2 cm given the layering and minor piling. Carrot salad mixed with corn and tomatoes is relatively dense due to the moisture content and dressing. Volume-wise, this equates roughly to about 80-100 ml of food. The density will be close to water-density or slightly less due to the volume of fibrous shredded carrot, so the weight is likely close to its volume in grams, perhaps slightly less or close to equal. Therefore, from volume and density reasoning, the weight of the salad on the plate is approximately 85 grams. Cross-checking via ingredient count: around 10 cherry tomato halves visible, with cherry tomatoes about 10 g each whole, so about 5 whole tomatoes = ~50 g tomatoes. Corn kernels are numerous but small, perhaps 15-20 g corn, and shredded carrot visible volume supports about 15-20 g. Added together this matches close to the volume-based estimate. Thus, the weight estimate of 85 g is reasonable and plausible."

The image shows a plate with three food items: gnocchi au basilic, chou-fleur, and oeufs brouillés (scrambled eggs). I need to estimate the weight of the oeufs brouillés. The scrambled eggs occupy about a quarter of a standard 26 cm diameter dinner plate. Visually, the eggs are spread out but have some volume due to fluffiness. Comparing to the other items, the cauliflower florets look roughly 120-150 grams total, and the gnocchi portion seems medium, probably around 100-120 grams. Typical cooked scrambled eggs weigh around 100 grams for 2 large eggs; the volume here looks like it could come from about 2 eggs. Given this size and fluffiness, the volume and density suggest around 90-110 grams. Verifying by volume: the eggs cover roughly a 10 cm by 8 cm area with about 1.5 cm thickness (estimated from shadows and layering), giving a raw volume of approx 120 cubic cm. Eggs are dense (roughly 1 g/cm3), so that is about 120 grams. Adjusting downward slightly for air pockets, around 100 grams is a good estimate. Both per-egg calculation and volume estimation agree within 10%, so final weight estimate for oeufs brouillés is 100 grams."

The specified food is salami presented as thinly sliced pieces on a plate next to radishes and an open sandwich with ham. Each slice of salami is roughly 3-4 cm in diameter and quite thin, consistent with typical Swiss salami slices. Typically, a thin slice of salami weighs about 10-15 g. Here, there are about 6 slices, though some are broken pieces; I estimate about 5 full slice equivalents. Multiplying 5 slices by approximately 12 g each gives about 60 g. Cross-checking using plate size and the size of radishes nearby (each radish about 10-12 g), the quantities on the plate appear consistent with 60 g of salami. Therefore, the final estimated weight of the salami portion is about 60 grams."

The specified food item is 'gaufre'. Observing the image, the waffle is rectangular with a grid pattern and appears to be about the size of a small to medium personal waffle, roughly 10 x 7.5 cm. It is a single portion item on a standard dinner plate (~26 cm diameter), and the waffle thickness is about 1.5 to 2 cm. A typical homemade or store-bought small rectangular waffle in Switzerland weighs about 80-100 grams. The waffle here seems fully cooked but not thick or oversized, so estimating 90 grams for the waffle is reasonable. The compote pomme is spread on top but is considered separately and excluded from this weight estimation. Double-checking against typical commercial portions and relative plate size confirms 90 grams as a plausible and accurate estimate for this waffle."

The specified food is 'viande' (meat), which appears as a cooked ground meat patty on the plate. The patty's size can be compared to the potatoes and plate diameter (a standard plate ~26 cm). The meat portion is somewhat irregular but roughly rectangular, about 10 cm long and 5-6 cm wide. Thickness appears around 1.5 cm, accounting for some unevenness. Ground cooked meat density is approximately 0.96 g/cm³. Volume estimate = length × width × thickness = 10×6×1.5 = 90 cm³. Mass estimate = 90 × 0.96 ≈ 86 g. Cross-checking: A typical cooked meat portion in such a serving is often around 80-120 g, so 86 g is plausible. The meat does not look overly thick or large to exceed 100 g nor too thin to be under 70 g. Therefore, the best estimate for the weight of the meat portion is 86 grams."

The food item to estimate is 'flocon d'avoines' (oat flakes) visible in the white bowl, where it occupies roughly half the bowl's flat area, with the other half covered by a similar amount of flaxseeds. A standard white bowl diameter is about 20 cm. These oat flakes are spread in a thin layer, not piled high, approximately 1-1.5 cm thick when adjusted for the thinness of flakes. Thin, dry oat flakes have a typical bulk density around 0.3-0.4 g/cm³. Estimating the volume: the approximate half-bowl area is roughly half of π*(10 cm radius)^2 = ~157 cm^2. Multiply by an approximate thickness of 1 cm (they are spread thin, so around this figure), gives volume ~157 cm³. Multiplying by density ~0.35 g/cm³ gives approximately 55 g. Using a secondary check: a standard serving of oat flakes is around 40-50 g, and the amount here seems consistent with slightly more than a standard serving in a single thin layer. Considering some visual underestimation of depth due to the flakes' irregular shape, the estimate of about 50-60 g fits logically. Therefore, a middle estimate of 55 g is reasonable and consistent with visual and known portion sizes."
p96w4a,croissants au jambon,37.0,75,38.0,0.17332347140039447,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/7bd6e67d-b1ca-42e4-a5ca-713b7fadda27,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'croissants au jambon', which are the two smaller croissants visible on the plate. These croissants appear to be mini-sized and filled with ham, given their slightly glossy, baked golden-brown exterior and relatively compact size. Each croissant looks to be about 7-8 cm in length, which is typical for mini croissants. A typical mini croissant (plain) weighs around 25-30 grams, and with the ham inside, the weight is slightly increased. Estimating the filling as about 5-10 grams of ham per croissant, the total per croissant is around 35-40 grams. Since there are two croissants, the combined weight estimate would be approximately 70-80 grams. Using a consistency check, comparing their size to the carrot sticks and the bread slices on the plate confirms their mini size, supporting the 70-80 g range for both croissants together. Therefore, a reasonable and visually consistent estimate for the total weight of the two croissants au jambon is 75 grams."

The specified food item is 'chips vaya beans,' which appear as light, thin, crispy chips with visible green and black specks, likely from the beans. The chips are spread on a standard porcelain plate, which I estimate to be about 26 cm in diameter based on common tableware sizes and the plate's decoration style. The chips cover only the central area of the plate, leaving some rim visible, indicating a moderate serving size. The chips are thin and airy, so they weigh less than they look. Chips of this type generally weigh about 0.5 to 1 gram each for average-sized pieces. Counting roughly, there are around 15–20 visible pieces of chips, with some overlapping and a few small fragments. Considering the thinness and estimated portion volume, a reasonable weight estimate is about 20–30 grams. Cross-checking by visual volume and comparison to the plate size confirms this range. Thus, the most accurate weight estimate for this portion of 'chips vaya beans' given the image is 25 grams."

The specified food item ""poivron"" (bell pepper) is clearly visible as thin red strips on the plate, next to other items. The portion appears to be approximately a small handful of sliced bell pepper pieces. A medium whole bell pepper typically weighs around 150 to 200 g. Judging by the visual portion size, this is roughly half or slightly less of one small to medium pepper. The pieces are thinly sliced and lay flat, showing approximately one layer thickness. Comparing to the size of the chicken pieces nearby and the plate's estimated diameter (~26 cm), this portion is around 70-90 grams. Cross-validating with typical bell pepper slice weights and visible volume, 80 grams is a reasonable estimate for the given portion of poivron."
2ahgvr,toast,55.0,90,35.0,0.23730276134122288,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/feb15752-d5e3-4f73-8eeb-9fb560cc6f6b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. In the image, there are two slices of toasted bread with a spread of fromage frais. The bread slices appear to be standard sliced bread, and a typical Swiss bread slice is about 40-60 grams. Toasting does not significantly change the weight, so the bread itself likely weighs in that range. The fromage frais spread is thinly but evenly applied on both slices. Considering a light spread, a reasonable estimate is about 10 grams of fromage frais total (roughly 5 grams per slice). The specified food item is 'toast' (which I interpret as the bread itself without topping). Since there are two slices visible, each about 45 grams on average, the total weight of the toast is approximately 90 grams. Cross-checking by the plate size (~26 cm) and knife handle (typical size) confirms these slices are standard size, so 90 grams for two slices is plausible and within the Swiss reference range. Therefore, the best estimate for the 'toast' weight present is 90 grams."
m4egh2,carottes,38.0,6,32.0,0.14990138067061143,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/768d6aed-623c-4cfb-8f4e-e33da1f18a76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, the specified food item is 'carottes'. Visually, the carrots are thinly sliced and spread sparsely mixed with the pasta and aubergines in the bowl. The bowl diameter is roughly 20-22 cm based on typical table size context. The carrot slices appear to cover parts of the surface but are thin and few in number. Since the carrots are cooked or softened and thinly sliced, their density is close to raw carrots (~0.64 g/cm3) but portion volume is small. Counting visible slices, approximately 5-7 carrot slices are discernible, each about 5-6 cm long and 1.5-2 cm wide, but very thin (about 1-2 mm thick). So each slice volume is roughly 5 cm × 1.8 cm × 0.15 cm = 1.35 cm3. Total volume roughly 7 × 1.35 = ~9.5 cm3. Multiplying by carrot density (~0.64 g/cm3), gives approximately 6 grams. Checking from a portion perspective, this quantity is quite small compared to the pasta, consistent with the image. There is no large hidden volume beneath, as the bowl is not heaped and depth of carrot is minimal among other ingredients. A secondary check against the relative fill of the bowl and overall volume of the pasta confirms this order of magnitude is reasonable and consistent. Thus, an estimate of about 6 grams is appropriate for the visible carrot portion."

The food item to estimate is 'maréchal'. On the plate, maréchal appears as small cheese cubes, roughly 5 visible pieces. Typically, Swiss cheese cubes for serving weigh about 10-15 grams each (depending on size). Each cube looks to be about 2 cm on each side, approximating a volume of about 8 cm³. Given cheese density around 1.1 g/cm³, each cube weighs approximately 8.8 g, rounding to about 9 g. For 5 cubes, the total weight would be 5 × 9 = 45 g. Cross-validation by visual size relative to the eggs (each about 50 g) confirms the estimate, as the cubes collectively take up roughly a quarter of one egg's volume, consistent with 40-50 g total. Therefore, the most reasonable estimate is 45 grams."
wrah5h,pain/galette,90.0,63,27.0,0.2995562130177515,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/e3bda09e-e437-4ac8-bfbf-4f282e801bfc,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a rolled flatbread or galette, partially eaten, in a metal tray. The flatbread resembles a thin, large tortilla or wrap, typical in Swiss or European meals. It is roughly folded twice and the visible size is approximately 20-25 cm in length before folding, fitting inside a tray of about 20-25 cm width, which is consistent with a standard large flatbread size. Flatbreads of this sort typically weigh between 60 to 100 g when whole. Given the flatness and size, and considering it is partially eaten (about 30% missing based on the visible eaten section), the remaining part should still constitute about 70% of the original flatbread. Assuming the whole flatbread weighs about 90 g (within the typical 60-100 g range for this size), 70% remaining means about 63 g present in the tray. Cross-checking by visual thickness and size, the weight is plausible. Thus, the estimated weight of the 'pain/galette' in the image is about 60-65 g. I will take 63 g as a balanced estimate."

The specified food item is ""pâtes"" (pasta), which is the portion of spiral pasta on the plate. The plate diameter appears to be a standard size of around 26 cm. The pasta occupies roughly a third of the plate's area, forming a fairly compact mound. The pasta is cooked, so it is denser than dry pasta but lighter than a dense protein. The quantity looks like a typical main course serving, neither small nor very large. Estimating volume: the pasta portion looks roughly 12 cm by 8 cm in area and about 2-3 cm thick (based on curvature and overlap). This gives a rough volume around 200 cm³. Cooked pasta typically weighs about 140 g per 200 cm³ volume, given its water content and density. Another cross-check: A standard dry pasta serving is about 70-80 g dry, which roughly doubles to 150-160 g cooked weight. Visually, this portion matches around a typical single portion cooked serving. Therefore, the estimated weight for the ""pâtes"" on this plate is about 150 g."

The specified food item is 'pain', which refers to the two slices of bread on the plate. The plate diameter is approximately 26 cm, a typical size. The two slices of bread occupy roughly 1/5 to 1/4 of the plate's diameter in length each. Swiss bread slices typically weigh between 40-60 g. Compared to the knife and the plate, these slices look like medium-density rustic bread; they are not unusually thick or thin. Given the size and visible crumb structure, each slice likely weighs around 50 g. There are two slices on the plate, but because the item asked is just 'pain' without counting multiples, it is reasonable to estimate the weight of one standard slice as the base unit. Therefore, the weight of one slice is about 50 grams. This fits well within the Swiss reference range for a standard bread slice (40-60 g)."
wrah5h,mozzarella,54.0,80,26.0,0.17307692307692307,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1550c506-8c95-461f-b658-8f427dc2a0af,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is mozzarella, which is clearly visible as a dollop placed on top of cooked pasta. Mozzarella in this form appears to be a creamy, soft type (likely fresh mozzarella or similar curd). Typically, a single serving scoop of fresh mozzarella sized as shown is about 80-100 grams based on volume and consistency. Comparing the portion size relative to the pasta (around a medium heap) and considering the typical density of mozzarella (softer and less dense than hard cheese but still substantial) and the plate size (around 26 cm diameter), the dollop is roughly the size of a small scoop or half a standard small mozzarella ball. The volume looks equivalent to 1/3 of a 150-180 g mozzarella ball, which often measures around 120-150 g. Hence, the mozzarella portion is estimated at about 80 g. To cross-check, it is larger than a tablespoon but smaller than a small yogurt pot (180 g), consistent with the 80 g range. This estimate aligns well with the visual cues and standard Swiss fresh mozzarella portion sizes."

The specified food to estimate is ""séré maigre"". In the image, there is a bowl containing a thick, creamy mixture with visible chia seeds and a light brownish spread that is likely hazelnut purée. The séré maigre, a low-fat quark cheese, serves as the creamy base. The bowl is medium-sized and the quantity inside covers most of the bottom of the bowl but is not filled to the top. Given the typical portion size for séré maigre would be around a small to medium serving, and considering the density and spread of the food, it looks to be about 150 to 180 grams. Comparing to standard quark pots in Switzerland (usually 100 g per small cup), the amount here appears roughly like one and a half standard pots, especially accounting for the chia seeds and purée mixed in, which add volume but only partially weight. Hence, an estimate around 170 grams for the séré maigre component is plausible and fits the portion size visible. Cross-validating the visual volume with typical quark container sizes and the depth observed leads to a reliable estimate of 170 grams for the séré maigre in the bowl."

The specified food is 'tomate'. In the image, the tomatoes are sliced and placed next to mozzarella and millet inside a rectangular container. The container seems to be a typical lunch box, around 15 cm long and 10 cm wide. The tomato slices cover roughly one third of the container's surface area, and their thickness appears thin, typical for sliced fresh tomato. A medium large tomato in Switzerland typically weighs around 150 g. The slices shown likely come from half a medium tomato (due to the area and volume covered), suggesting an estimated weight close to 75 g. Cross-validation by comparing to the mozzarella pieces and millet quantity confirms that this amount is reasonable for the visible portion. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'tomate' as about 75 grams."

The specified food item is 'salade'. The salad portion is placed on a standard plate of approximately 26 cm diameter. The salad occupies roughly one-third of the plate area, appearing fresh with visible lettuce leaves and some sunflower seeds. Lettuce is mostly water and light, so the visible volume is not dense, but the height and layering show at least a double layer of leaves, adding some volume. A typical serving of leafy salad on such a plate portion would range between 30 g and 70 g depending on density and dressing, but here the leaves look lightly dressed and fresh. Comparing the size relative to the risotto portion (which seems like a standard main serving size approx. 200-250 g of cooked rice), the salad weighs about 50-60 g. Given the visible quantity and layering, I estimate around 55 grams. Cross-checking with average leafy salad servings on plates this size, 55 g is reasonable and plausible without over or underestimating leaf density or volume. Therefore, the best estimate for the weight of the salade is 55 g."

The specified food is the salade composed of green lettuce, carrots, avocado, and dressing. Visually, the salad portion occupies about half the plate, next to two fried eggs and a piece of sesame bread. The plate diameter is about standard 26 cm. The lettuce leaves are fresh and leafy, carrot strips are visible and avocado chunks are noticeable but not overly thick, suggesting moderate volume. Considering average densities for leafy salad mixed with vegetables and a small amount of avocado (density of avocado roughly 0.9 g/ml, lettuce and carrot less dense), the total salad volume likely corresponds to about 200-250 ml. Dressing weight is minimal and accounted for here as a light coating. Using volume-to-weight approximation for mixed salad (about 0.5 to 0.7 g/ml), the estimated weight falls between 100 and 175 grams. Cross-checking with the visible avocado pieces (they look like roughly 30-40 g avocado), carrot strips and lettuce leaves, plus dressing, a reasonable estimate is around 140 g in total. This fits given the volume and visible density. Therefore, the estimated weight of the salade is 140 g."

The specified food item is 'avocat' (avocado). Visually, there are two slices of avocado on the wrap. Each slice appears to be about one-quarter to one-third of a medium avocado. A typical medium avocado in Switzerland weighs around 150-170 g total, including the pit and skin, with edible flesh roughly 70-80% of that weight. Taking an average edible avocado weight of about 120 g, and given that the two slices roughly match about half of an avocado's flesh volume, we estimate the weight of the avocado on the wrap. Half of 120 g is about 60 g. Cross-checking with visual size relative to other items (tomato slices, carrot shreds, and ham slice), this estimate seems reasonable since the avocado slices cover a moderate area and are of normal thickness. Therefore, the weight of the avocado as presented is about 60 grams."
p96w4a,tartine mélasse + beurre,39.0,60,21.0,0.10096153846153846,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/c9db26cc-13d6-4355-97a6-2355ea46cf42,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'tartine mélasse + beurre', which appears as the slice of bread on the bottom of the plate. The bread slice looks like a typical Swiss bread slice size — roughly 12-14 cm in length and about 5-6 cm wide on this cut half-circle form. A standard Swiss slice of bread weighs between 40-60 g, and this portion corresponds to about half a baguette-type loaf slice, so about 50 g is a fair estimate for the slice itself. For the butter, the layer is visible but not thick, likely about 5 g (a thin spread). The mélasse (molasses) is applied as a light to moderate drizzle, appearing as a thin but visible layer, estimated around 5 g. Adding these together: 50 g (bread) + 5 g (butter) + 5 g (mélasse) = 60 g total. Double-checking against the plate size (~26 cm diameter), the bread slice takes about 40% of the plate diameter, consistent with typical slice sizes and weight. The honey/melasse glaze tends to be dense, but thinly spread here, so 5 g is reasonable. This combined estimation is coherent with typical Swiss portion sizes and appearance. Therefore, I'd estimate the weight of the 'tartine mélasse + beurre' as 60 grams."

The specified food item is 'muesli nature'. It is served in a small terracotta bowl. The bowl appears to be about 10-12 cm in diameter (comparable to a teaspoon handle and the white dish next to it). The muesli is in it as clusters, somewhat loosely packed with visible air gaps. Considering typical density, 1 heaped tablespoon of muesli weighs about 15-20 g. The bowl seems to contain about 4-5 heaped tablespoons worth of muesli clusters. This suggests roughly 60-100 g. Cross-checking with volume, the bowl capacity looks like about 100-120 ml, and the muesli fills nearly to the top. Given muesli's density (dry cereal) is less than water and more than airy foods, approximately 0.6-0.8 g/ml, this gives about 70-96 g. These two estimates converge on about 80-90 g. Hence, the weight of the muesli nature in this bowl is about 85 g to balance the mid values and account for slight unseen air gaps and irregular clumps."

The specified food item is 'beurre' (butter). The image shows four slices of bread spread with butter and strawberry jam. Each slice appears lightly spread with butter beneath the jam, providing a thin layer rather than a thick slab. A typical thin spread of butter on a slice of bread usually weighs about 5-7 grams. Since the butter is not heavily applied but visible under the jam on all four slices, I estimate about 6 grams per slice. Multiplying by 4 slices gives approximately 24 grams. Cross-checking is consistent with the visual coverage and typical per-slice butter use in Swiss meals. Hence, total butter used on the plate is around 24 grams."
xjvrtk,épautre cuit,160.0,180,20.0,0.39447731755424065,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/02911570-1e99-4b2c-9ad0-469321a8a342,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item to estimate is 'épautre cuit' (cooked spelt). In the image, the épautre cuit occupies roughly one-third of a medium-sized rectangular glass container (approximately 20 cm by 15 cm), alongside scrambled eggs and roasted eggplant slices. Given the visible depth and density of cooked spelt grains, it looks like a typical portion served. Cooked spelt is quite dense and grains are close-packed. The container appears about 4-5 cm deep, and the spelt portion fills this depth adequately over its share of the container space. For a Swiss-sized portion of cooked grains, a typical serving ranges from 150 to 200 grams. Given the volume here—approximately one-third of the container's bottom area and full depth—and the density of cooked spelt, an estimate around 180 grams is reasonable. Cross-validating: given the container size, the portion is sizable but not overly heaped. 180 g aligns well with serving sizes for grains in Swiss meals and matches the visual portion compared to the other foods present. Therefore, 180 grams is a balanced and plausible estimate."

The specified food item is 'oeufs' (eggs). In the image, two fried eggs are visible on top of the pasta. Each whole raw chicken egg typically weighs about 50-60 grams before cooking. Cooking reduces some water content but does not significantly reduce overall weight for estimation purposes. Fried eggs spread in the pan and lose some moisture but overall, the weight remains close to the initial weight. Two fried eggs together should weigh approximately 100-120 grams. The eggs here appear fully cooked with some yolk oozing out, confirming they are whole eggs, not partial. Based on this observation, the two eggs together estimate roughly 110 grams. Checking with plate size (rectangular plate about 25x15 cm) and the relative size of the eggs, this weight fits within a logical range for two medium eggs fried. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'oeufs' in the image as 110 grams."

The specified food is 'demi croissant,' which means half a croissant. A full croissant typically weighs around 60-70 g in Switzerland. The photo shows roughly half of a croissant, so half of 60-70 g is approximately 30-35 g. The croissant appears fresh and slightly flaky, consistent with this weight range. The visible butter and apricot jam add negligible additional weight and are not requested for estimation. Therefore, focusing solely on the demi croissant, the best estimate based on typical Swiss bakery item weight and the visible half piece is about 33 grams."

The specified food is 'légumes (courgette, oignon, 1 cs d'huile d'olive)'. Visually, the portion of sautéed zucchini and onions on the plate covers roughly a third of the total plate area, and appears to be a single cooked layer of vegetables without excessive depth. The plate is a standard dinner plate (~26 cm diameter), providing scale. The vegetables are sliced fairly thinly, and the sautéed mixture looks moderately dense but not piled high. A full raw zucchini weighs about 200-300 g; here, the amount of zucchini visible is roughly equivalent to about one medium zucchini but cooked down (which reduces water content). Onions usually add volume but are lighter; the amount of onion here appears moderate, about half of a small onion. Oil weight (1 tablespoon olive oil) is about 13.5 g, but we exclude this since only the vegetables' weight is needed. For cooked vegetables, weight is somewhat less than raw due to water loss, but the volume here includes cooked moisture, so raw and cooked weights are similar. Estimating the cooked vegetable weight alone: about 150 g zucchini + 50 g onion = 200 g total cooked vegetables. Cross-checking by volume on plate: the vegetables cover about 1/3 plate, while rice and egg fill the rest - this supports the ~200 g estimate as plausible. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'légumes' is about 200 g."

The specified food is 'pain' (bread). From the image, the bread piece is a medium slice torn from a loaf of typical homemade or artisanal bread, with visible texture and crust. The slice is roughly 12-14 cm long and about 6-7 cm wide, with thickness around 2-3 cm. A typical Swiss bread slice weighs between 40-60 g, and this piece is smaller than a full standard slice, more like 60-70% of a full slice. Using the reference of 50 g for a full typical Swiss bread slice, 60-70% corresponds to about 30-35 g. Checking the volume and thickness visually confirms that the piece is about two-thirds the size of a whole slice. Therefore, the best estimate for the bread piece weight is 33 g."

The specified food is 'riz complet' (whole grain rice). Observing the image, the rice is served on a standard plate (~26 cm diameter) in a moderate portion. The rice mound roughly covers about one-third of the plate's quarter section, forming a small compact mound of cooked rice. Cooked whole grain rice density is similar to regular cooked rice, approximately 130-140 g per cup (about 240 ml volume). Visually estimating volume: the mound appears to be around 150-170 ml in volume, thus roughly 90-100 grams. Cross-validating by portion proportion: for a balanced meal with salmon and salad, around 90-110 g cooked rice is typical, matching the visual volume and standard serving sizes. Therefore, estimating the weight of the riz complet portion as about 100 grams is plausible and consistent with the observed visual clues and standard portion ranges."

The specified food item is 'raviolis a la courge'. From the image, we can see about 7 ravioli pieces on a standard-sized dinner plate (~26 cm diameter). Each ravioli appears roughly 4-5 cm square, typical for fresh or store-bought filled pasta. The Swiss average weight for stuffed pasta like ravioli is about 15 to 20 g per piece, depending on filling density. Pumpkin (courge) filling is moderately dense but not heavy. Assuming about 18 g per piece, 7 pieces would weigh approximately 126 g. Cross-checking with volume and appearance: the ravioli cover roughly a 12x12 cm area, one layer only, visible with some pepper on top, no hidden layers visible, so no upward adjustment needed. Therefore, 126 g is a plausible estimate, fitting within typical portion sizes and consistent with plate scale."

The specified food item is 'asperges' (asparagus). Visually, there are about 7 asparagus spears on the plate. A typical cooked asparagus spear in Switzerland weighs roughly 12-15 grams, depending on thickness and length. These appear medium thickness and average length, close to the typical portion size. Multiplying 7 spears by 13 grams average gives approximately 91 grams. To sanity check, the spears cover roughly 1/3 of the 26 cm diameter plate across their length, consistent with normal asparagus size and weight. No container is present, so the per-item count method is suitable. Thus, the best estimate is around 90 grams for the asparagus on this plate."

The image shows a stack of four rectangular Blevita crackers. Each Blevita cracker typically weighs around 8-10 grams in Swiss standards, given their size and density as a crispbread product. There is no visible packaging to assess, so we rely on per-item weight. The size looks consistent with standard Blevita crispbreads. Four crackers at approximately 9 grams each sum to about 36 grams. The thickness and density do not suggest a heavier or lighter weight, and the crackers are stacked flat, not broken, confirming the count. This estimation aligns with expectations for such crispbread products and is cross-checked against typical weights of similar Swiss crackers."

The specified food item is 'tomme fleurette'. On the plate, there are several cheese pieces and other foods arranged around a slice of baguette and a piece of trout. The 'tomme fleurette' is identified as a creamy white cheese with a soft rind, located towards the bottom right area of the plate near other cheeses such as brie and goat cheese. Its size is roughly comparable to the other cheese pieces, likely around 3 cm long and 2 cm wide, with a thickness of about 1.5-2 cm. Cheeses like tomme fleurette are fairly dense but soft; a piece of this size typically weighs in the range of 25-40 g. Considering the visible volume and comparing to the other cheeses and the slice of baguette (typical bread slice weight 40-60 g), this piece is smaller in volume and denser than bread. A calibrated estimate based on volume and visual comparison leads to a weight around 30 g. Double-checking with standard cheese portion sizes and the plate scale confirms this is plausible and consistent. Therefore, 30 g is a reasonable estimate for the weight of the tomme fleurette portion on the plate."

The specified food item is 'sauce bolognese.' The portion is visibly served on top of spaghetti on a standard-sized plate (~26 cm diameter). The sauce layer covers roughly half the plate's spaghetti area with a moderate thickness, judging by the depth and coverage. Typical portion sizes for bolognese sauce on pasta range from 100 to 150 grams. The sauce appears neither too thin nor heaped, suggesting a medium portion size. Considering the depth and spread over the pasta, an estimate near the midpoint (~120 g) is reasonable. Cross-checking with typical homemade or restaurant serving sizes, this also fits. Thus, the estimated weight of the visible bolognese sauce is about 120 grams."

The image shows a single slice of tarte à la rhubarbe on a standard white plate (~26 cm diameter) with a knife and fork beside for scale. The slice is roughly triangular and appears to be one piece of a whole round tart. The visible slice occupies approximately one-sixth to one-eighth of a typical tart. A full rhubarb tart in Switzerland would likely weigh between 600 and 800 grams based on typical homemade or bakery tarts, including crust, filling, and rhubarb pieces. Estimating 700 g for the whole tart, a slice representing 1/6th of the whole would be approx. 115-120 g. Cross-reference: the rhubarb pieces on top look dense but sparse, not overly thick, consistent with typical tart servings. The crust and custard-like base add some weight but are not thick. The portion's thickness and volume support this. Therefore, a slice is logically around 110-130 g, and the average estimate is 120 g. This aligns well with known portion sizes of similar pies/tarts and the plate and cutlery scaling."

The specified food item is ""pousses de graines"" (sprouts). In the image, the sprouts are situated among fresh spinach leaves and halved cherry tomatoes. They appear as thin white and greenish strands distributed over roughly half the plate. The plate seems to be a standard square dish about 20 cm wide or slightly smaller. The sprouts are not in a package but are loosely piled over leafy spinach. Estimating volume, the sprouts layer is quite thin but covers about half the visible plate surface. Sprouts are mostly water and light in density. Typically, a cup of fresh sprouts weighs around 30 grams. Here, the spread looks around half a cup, so approximately 15 grams is a reasonable initial estimate. To cross-check, comparing to the six fallafels on the plate, which each typically weigh about 30-40 grams, the sprouts are visibly much lighter and smaller in mass. This supports the estimate of about 15 grams. The spinach and tomatoes nearby further help scale the volume. Thus, 15 grams is a solid estimate for the visible quantity of sprouts. Considering possible hidden layers under the spinach is minimal since the sprouts are atop the leaves and clearly seen. Therefore, no upward adjustment needed."

The item to estimate is ""épinards frais"" (fresh spinach). Visually, the spinach leaves cover most of the bottom layer of the bowl, appearing as fresh, whole leaves rather than chopped or pureed. The bowl appears to be a medium-sized salad bowl with roughly 20-22 cm width internally. The spinach layer is relatively thin, about 1 to 2 cm thick as estimated from leaf overlap and shadows, and the leaves are loosely arranged, not tightly packed. Considering the volume, it looks like about one large handful or more spread out as a bed for the other ingredients. Spinach is relatively light and has low density. A large handful of fresh spinach leaves typically weighs about 30-40 grams. To check volume, comparing to the size of cherry tomatoes (about 8-12 g each) and falafels (circa 25-35 g each, depending on size), the spinach underlies about 8 falafels and a handful of cherry tomato halves. The spinach weight is unlikely less than 25 grams or more than 50 grams given the visible thickness and bowl size. Therefore, a reasonable estimate is approximately 40 grams of fresh spinach."

The specified food item is ""pain"" (bread). The image shows a single slice of white bread on a plate. The slice is a typical pre-sliced sandwich bread portion, resembling standard Swiss bread slices. Standard Swiss bread slices weigh between 40-60 grams typically. This slice appears of average thickness and size. There is no visible additional layering or extra thickness. Therefore, the reasonable estimate for this bread slice is approximately the mid-point of the standard range, about 50 grams. Cross-check: considering the slice size relative to the plate (~26 cm diameter), the bread slice is about 12-15 cm wide, fitting typical bread slice dimensions. No large deviations in size or thickness are visible to adjust the estimate significantly up or down."

The salad de pâtes is presented on a standard plate roughly 26 cm in diameter, with a small remaining serving visible. The pasta type is penne, which typically weighs about 12-15 g per cooked large piece. Visually, there are about 15 penne pieces left on the plate. Mixed in are small vegetables like corn kernels and cherry tomatoes cut into smaller pieces. The pasta appears lightly dressed with oil or sauce, so no significant weight increase from that. The total volume of the food is a small pile covering a roughly 8 cm diameter area, not very deep (maximum one layer visible and some small parts visible underneath). Comparing the pile size to the plate and to known portion volumes, this portion looks like a leftover small portion rather than a full serving. Typical cooked pasta salads for a full serving would weigh around 150-200 grams. Given the visible amount, it seems to be roughly one-quarter or less of a normal full portion. Cross-validating by the count of pasta pieces (15 pieces × approx. 10 g each cooked), gives approximately 150 g, but cooked penne is dense and weighs around 8-10 g per piece depending on size. Adjusting for some missing pieces and vegetables, a safer range is around 90-110 grams. Considering this and the visual small quantity, the best estimate is about 100 grams."

The specified food item is 'framboises' (raspberries). In the image, there are six visible raspberries placed in a small cluster on the plate. Each raspberry typically weighs about 4-5 grams, considering Swiss raspberries. They appear fresh and medium-sized. Multiplying 6 raspberries by approximately 4.5 grams each, the total estimated weight is around 27 grams. Cross-checking this estimate, the raspberries occupy a space slightly less than half of an average sized blueberry punnet (125 g retail weight), which aligns well with the per-item counting estimation. Therefore, the plausible and consistent weight estimate for the raspberries is 27 grams."

The salade de céleri appears as a small mound of shredded white vegetable in the bottom right corner of the white plate. It looks like grated celery root (celeriac). The volume of the pile is roughly about the size of a small handful on the plate, which is about 25 cm² base area with some small depth. Comparing it to the other items on the plate — the chicken portion on top left and grated carrot salad — the celery salad pile is smaller but dense. Celery root is relatively dense but not as dense as cooked meat. A reasonable volume estimate would be around 50-70 grams for this portion. Cross-checking with typical salad portion sizes and visual comparison to the size of the plate and carrot salad, about 60 grams is a plausible estimate."

The specified food is 'salade verte', which is the green salad visible near the bottom right part of the plate. The green salad portion covers a small area on the plate. The plate diameter is likely around 26 cm, a standard dinner plate size, helping us scale the salad volume. The green salad appears to be mostly composed of leafy greens lightly coated with dressing, so its density is low, roughly 0.2 to 0.3 g/cm³ compared to watery foods. The salad layer appears relatively thin, about 1 to 1.5 cm thick, and the area covered is approximately 1/6 of the plate's surface (around 85 cm²). Estimating volume gives approximately 85 cm² × 1.5 cm = 127 cm³. Using a leafy salad density of about 0.25 g/cm³ leads to roughly 32 grams. Cross-validating by visual portion size typical for such a meal: a side of salad generally weighs about 30-50 grams. This fits into the typical range and is consistent with the observed visual portion size versus other foods on the plate. Therefore, an estimate of about 30 grams for the 'salade verte' is reasonable."

The image shows two slices of bread on a plate, each lightly spread with different toppings. The specified food item is ""beurre"" (butter). It is visible as a thin layer beneath both the jam and the chocolate spread. Considering that typical butter spread on bread is quite thin, the quantity is small but visible. A usual thin spread of butter on a single slice of Swiss bread (roughly 50 g) typically weighs around 5 to 10 grams, depending on thickness. Here the butter layer is thin and uneven but covers most of the surface of each slice. Since butter is dense (~0.9 g/cm³) and not too thick, the plausible estimate is about 7 grams per slice. Both slices appear to have butter underneath their respective toppings. Since the task is to estimate butter weight, and seeing two slices, the total butter amount would be roughly double. However, the user requested the weight of ""beurre"" without specifying if total or per slice. Given the wording, likely it is the total visible butter amount on the plate. Therefore, combined butter weight is about 14 grams. To cross-validate, the area covered by butter compares to the slice size (county size standard bread slices) and thickness compared to a teaspoon (5 g water density). Since butter is thicker and spread sparsely, 14 grams total is a reasonable estimate. The butter weight is well within typical household amounts and visually consistent. Hence, the final estimate for ""beurre"" present on the two slices of bread is 14 grams."

The specified food is 'myrtilles' (blueberries). In the image, there are about 15 visible blueberries. According to Swiss reference, each blueberry weighs approximately 1-2 g. Using an average of 1.5 g per blueberry, 15 blueberries would weigh about 22.5 g. The blueberries are placed on a small plate, with no visible container or packaging affecting their volume. They appear fresh and without any visible weighing bias, and their size matches the typical Swiss blueberry size. To double-check, comparing to the other berries (strawberries and raspberries) and the plate diameter (~15 cm bowl on a larger table), the estimate of approximately 20-25 g is plausible. Thus, the estimated weight for the blueberries is about 22 g."

The sauce vinaigrette is visible as a drizzle over the various food elements in the container, mostly seen atop the tofu, tomatoes, and carrots. The vinaigrette has a light to moderate coverage and does not pool heavily in any spots. A typical vinaigrette drizzle per serving in such a portion is roughly around 1 to 2 tablespoons, based on visual comparison to the size of the container and thickness of the drizzle. One tablespoon (15 ml) of vinaigrette typically weighs about 13-15 grams, considering it's oil and vinegar based and slightly less dense than water but close enough for estimation. The visible amount corresponds roughly to 1.5 tablespoons. Hence, multiplying 1.5 by approximately 14 grams yields about 21 grams. Cross-validation by considering the size of the food container (~15 cm wide, standard lunchbox), the vinaigrette coverage, and the distribution confirms this estimate is reasonable and not excessive compared to typical salad dressings. The vinaigrette weight is therefore estimated at about 20 grams."

The mayonnaise portion is a visually identifiable dollop on the plate to the left. It looks like a generous serving typical for dipping or complementing the other foods. Mayonnaise density is close to water but slightly heavier. The visible portion is about the size of a heaped tablespoon or slightly more. A heaped tablespoon of mayonnaise usually weighs around 15 grams. This portion is slightly bigger than a spoonful, approximately 20 grams. Cross-validation by comparing it to the volume of the adjacent aubergine slices and salad russe confirms that the mayonnaise dollop is compact and moderate in size. Hence, 20 grams is a reasonable and plausible estimate for the mayonnaise portion here."

The food item to estimate is 'tomates', which appear as three small slices on the wrap. These tomatoes look like regular fresh tomatoes, not cherry tomatoes. A typical large tomato weighs around 120-150g. The three slices represent approximately one quarter or slightly less of an average tomato, given the visible size of the slices compared to the wrap (about 20 cm diameter plate), and the thickness of each slice being about average. One-quarter of a standard tomato weighs roughly 30-40g. Checking visually, the slices occupy a small portion of the wrap and are not overly thick. Given that, estimating a combined weight of approximately 35g is reasonable. Cross-checking, the slices align with visual proportions of a typical tomato without overestimation."

The specified food item is 'beurre' (butter). In the image, the butter portion is visible as a small rectangular slab on the plate, partially crumbled. Compared to other items on the plate and considering the standard size of the plate (~26 cm diameter), the butter portion is small. A typical butter pat or serving in Switzerland for a meal is often around 10-15 g for a slice of this size. In the image, it looks like slightly less than a typical small butter serving; it is probably about 1 heaped teaspoon sized or slightly more. This aligns with a weight around 10-12 g. Cross-checking with the nearby bread pieces and slices of poultry, the butter portion corresponds to a small pat, so an estimate around 12 g is plausible, neither under- nor over-estimated. Therefore, the butter portion weighs about 12 grams."

The image shows several large pieces of pear ('poire') inside a standard plastic container. Each piece appears to be a significant cross-section of a pear, and multiple pieces together likely represent about one whole pear. A typical medium-sized Swiss pear weighs around 150-180 g. By visual estimation, the volume of all the pieces combined is approximately that of one medium-sized pear. There is no visible packing material or other food in the container, so the entire weight corresponds to the pear pieces. Using the pear’s typical weight and the visual estimate confirming close to a whole pear, the weight is best estimated at about 170 grams. To sanity check: the pieces cover a container space roughly corresponding to a single pear volume, and the thickness of the slices aligns with this estimate. Therefore, 170 grams is a reasonable and accurate weight estimate for these pear pieces."

The specified food item is 'pomme', which is an apple. From the image, the apple is small in size compared to a typical medium apple. A standard medium apple weighs between 120-150 g in Switzerland. This apple appears to be smaller than a typical medium apple, more like a small apple or a large crabapple variety. Based on the apparent diameter and proportions relative to the table surface and average apple size, the weight should be closer to 100 g. Cross-checking with typical Swiss apple sizes and weights, a small apple generally ranges from 90 to 110 g. Given the visual cues, the apple is likely about 100 g. This is consistent with the visual scale and typical apple weights in Switzerland."

The specified food item is 'galette millet maïs haricots noirs', which are two small patties visible in the lower left and center part of the container. They appear to be homemade or pre-prepared grain/legume patties made from millet, corn, and black beans. Each galette is about 5-6 cm in diameter and roughly 1-1.5 cm thick. Comparing their size to the container (which seems like a standard plastic food storage container ~18-20 cm long) and the adjacent goat cheese pieces (two chunks roughly 4-5 cm long), the patties are moderate in size but dense. For density, such patties typically weigh around 30-40 g each. Since there are two patties, the primary estimate is around 70-80 g total. Cross-validating by volume: the patties occupy an area of about 12 cm² each and are about 1 cm thick, so total volume roughly 24 cm³. Assuming density close to cooked grains and beans (~1 g/cm³), this matches about 70-80 g. Double-checking with portion size norms and visual fullness, this estimate is consistent. Therefore, the weight of the two galettes together is about 75 g."

The specified item is a 'branche de chocolat,' a chocolate bar stick. The chocolate piece shown is roughly the length of the fingers holding it, implying a length of about 7-9 cm. It is relatively thin and irregularly shaped with some nuts or inclusions visible. Typical small chocolate sticks with nuts commonly sold in Switzerland weigh around 25-35 grams per piece based on size and density. The chocolate bar is partially out of the wrapper, and the visible portion looks like a full standard size unit rather than a broken piece. Using the hand for scale, it looks like a small chocolate snack bar rather than a large bar, so 30 grams would be a plausible estimate. Cross-checking with typical weight standards of similar Swiss chocolate snack sticks confirms this. Therefore, the best estimate is 30 grams."

The biscuit portion in the image appears as thin, crisp pieces placed on top of the ice cream. These look like shards or broken bits rather than a whole biscuit, indicating a smaller portion. A typical Swiss biscuit weighs around 15 to 30 g depending on size and thickness. Given these are broken pieces, not a full biscuit, and considering their visible volume relative to the glass (standard dessert glass diameter ~7-8 cm) and surrounding items such as the meringue and kiwi slices, the biscuit portion is likely about half or less than a whole biscuit. Estimating half a biscuit or equivalent broken parts, the weight should be roughly 10 to 15 g. Cross-checking the visual scale with the other ingredients, this matches the expected portion size for a dessert garnish rather than a serving biscuit. Thus, I estimate the biscuit weight as 12 grams."

The specified food item is 'hummous,' which is located at the bottom left of the plate. It appears as a dense, creamy, beige spread, roughly the size of a heaped tablespoon. Given the plate is a standard size (~26 cm diameter), this portion of hummous is about 3-4 teaspoons heaped. Considering typical Swiss retail hummous tubs have a net weight of 150 g, and this portion looks to be approximately 20-25% of such a container, the estimate is approximately 35-40 g. Checking against visual scale and density (dense paste), this is plausible. Cross-validating with teaspoon volume (one heaped teaspoon ~10-15 g), 3 teaspoons would be 30-45 g, which aligns well. Both methods agree within ±20%. Therefore, the estimate for this hummous portion is 38 g."

The specified food item is 'graines de chia.' In the image, the mixture in the bowl clearly shows small black chia seeds dispersed throughout a creamy white base, which is identified as blanc battu with flakes of oats and honey. The bowl appears to be a small to medium cereal bowl, approximately 12-15 cm diameter judging by the size relative to the lighter and other nearby objects. The chia seeds are visible but dispersed thinly, mixed with other ingredients. Chia seeds have a typical density around 0.7 g/cm³, but here they're mixed rather than packed. Given the volume of mixture in the bowl, the chia seeds are less than a dense layer and correspond roughly to a few teaspoons spread throughout. A teaspoon of dry chia seeds weighs about 5 grams. Visually, about 2-3 teaspoons worth of chia seeds seem distributed in the bowl considering visible density and typical recipe proportions (chia seeds usually represent about 10-15% of the mixture by weight). Cross-checking with typical recipes for a bowl of this serving size, chia seeds range from 10 to 15 grams. Hence, the estimate for the weight of 'graines de chia' is around 12 grams."

The food item specified is 'beurre' (butter) on top of a slice of 'tresse' bread, spread under the apricot jam. Visually, the butter layer is thin and evenly spread across a single slice of tresse. A typical butter spread on bread for a single slice in Switzerland is usually around 5 to 10 grams, depending on thickness and coverage. Here, the coverage is moderate with some parts thinly spread. Using the teaspoon reference (5 g water-dense food), this butter spread appears somewhat less than a heaping teaspoon and fairly thin. Considering the size of the slice (standard tresse slice, close to 50-60 g bread), the butter layer looks light. Thus, estimating about 7 grams is logical. To cross-check, the visual thickness and spread suggest it is not a heavy pat but a modest thin layer, so about 7 grams fits well within plausible spreads and matches visual density. Therefore, the estimate for butter weight spread on this slice is 7 grams."

The food item to estimate is 'oeuf', which is the boiled egg visible on the plate. The egg is halved, showing half an egg yolk and egg white. A typical hard-boiled egg weighs around 50 grams in total, with the white portion being about 2/3 of the egg and the yolk about 1/3. Here, we see half an egg, so the visible part corresponds to roughly half the total weight, around 25 grams. There is no indication of missing parts or additional hidden volume, so the weight will be close to this half portion. Cross-checking against the plate size and other food items (like rice grains and cherry tomatoes) confirms that the size is consistent with a typical medium-sized egg. Therefore, the weight estimate for the visible half egg is approximately 25 grams."

The specified food item is 'beurre' (butter), which appears visibly spread on two slices of bread. Each slice is approximately a standard Swiss bread slice weighing between 40-60 g. The butter is spread thinly but noticeable. A typical thin spread of butter on a slice of bread usually weighs around 5 to 10 grams depending on thickness and coverage. Here the coverage looks moderate—enough to wet the surface but not thick. Since the butter is spread on two slices, and some melted into the bread texture, the total butter amount is roughly about 7 grams on the top slice with the mélasse and around 4 grams on the slice with Nutella, but since Nutella is the main spread on that slice, butter coverage is less noticeable, so I will only count roughly the butter on the slice with mélasse, i.e., about 7 grams. The total observed butter on both slices combined looks like approximately 8-9 grams but since the task is to estimate butter weight, I will focus on the visible butter layer overall and give a single combined weight: about 8 grams is plausible. A second estimate by volume comparison: a heaped teaspoon of butter is ~14 g, and this spread is much less than a heaped teaspoon, more like a thin layer equivalent to a flat teaspoon, so about 6-8 g. Thus, averaging the estimates leads to approximately 8 grams."

The image shows a single slice of pizza with visible mushrooms and tomato sauce. The plate is a standard size, about 26 cm in diameter, which helps gauge the pizza slice size. The slice looks like a small section, roughly around one-eighth of a whole pizza. A typical Swiss whole 30 cm pizza weighs between 450-550 g, and a standard single slice weighs 60-90 g. This slice looks slightly smaller than average—a bit narrower and shorter—so estimating closer to the lower end of the slice weight range is reasonable. The toppings are moderate and the crust thickness is average, meaning the density is typical for cooked pizza. Confirming by measuring the slice against plate and fork sizes, the weight should be about 55-65 g. Averaging this, a good estimate is around 60 g. This matches well with the typical known standard slice weight for Swiss pizza."

The specific item to estimate is 'huile de lin' (linseed oil). From the image, there is no visible bottle or clear container of oil on the plate; the oil is likely used as a dressing or cooking ingredient. Typically, linseed oil used in meals as a drizzle or mixed in small quantities weighs only a few grams. A common amount for oils drizzled or mixed in salads or cooked dishes is around 5 to 10 grams, equivalent to about a teaspoon to a tablespoon. Since the oil is not visibly pooled but presumably incorporated or lightly drizzled on the vegetables or galettes, a reasonable estimate is closer to a small drizzle amount. Using the teaspoon standard weight of about 5 grams, and observing no abundant oil but a likely thin coat, the estimate is about 5 grams. There is no container or visual mass to scale directly, so cross-checking with typical oil use and plate coverage supports this estimate. Thus, the final estimate for the visible and used amount of 'huile de lin' is 5 grams."

The salade portion is quite modest in size, covering a small area, roughly 6-7 cm in length and 4-5 cm in width, with visible leafy greens and some dressing or small chopped vegetables. The salad appears to be a simple leafy salad, relatively light and not piled high. Given the plate size and the salad's dimensions, the thickness appears to be about 1 to 1.5 cm. Leafy greens tend to be light but with some dressing and added ingredients the density increases slightly. Assuming a density close to 0.3-0.4 g/cm3 for such a mixed leafy salad portion with dressing, volume estimation is approximately 6 cm x 5 cm x 1.2 cm = 36 cm3, multiplied by 0.35 g/cm3 gives about 12-13 grams. The other estimate based on visual comparison with the risotto portion and considering typical restaurant side salad servings aligns well with this.

Ice cream density varies but is close to 0.5-0.7 g/ml due to air incorporation, so for this scoop, the weight should be between 30-60 g. Given it looks relatively dense and solid, I estimate nearer to 50 g. Cross-checking: a commercial ice cream scoop weight ranges from 40 to 60 g per scoop in Swiss contexts. The visible volume and texture correspond well to that estimate. Thus, the estimated weight of this hazelnut ice cream portion is 50 grams."

Typical weight for similar Swiss chocolate snack sticks ranges from 25 to 40 grams depending on thickness and density. Given the moderate thickness and typical density for chocolate with inclusions, the most reasonable estimate is around 30 grams. This is consistent with standard snack bars and seems plausible given the size and volume observed, and there is no container or packaging to adjust for. The lack of scale objects directly in the image means the wooden table grain and relative size hint is the main scale, supporting this size. Therefore, the weight estimate for this 'branche de chocolat' is 30 grams."

The specified food item is 'graine de chia' (chia seeds), visible in the jar as black small seeds mixed throughout the yogurt and oats mixture. Chia seeds are very small and dense, and typically used in small quantities. The jar shows a mixture with presumably layered ingredients: yogurt, oats, honey, and almond purée. The chia seeds are dispersed evenly throughout, likely soaked and expanded. 

From the visible portion, the seeds form numerous small black specks throughout the roughly 150-200 ml content of the jar. Chia seeds commonly weigh about 1.5 grams per tablespoon (about 15 ml). Given the density of speckles, the chia seeds likely amount to about 2-3 tablespoons mixed in, i.e., about 3-4.5 grams. Considering the content and typical recipe proportions, a best estimate is approximately 4 grams of chia seeds. 

Checking this with volume: 3 tablespoons of chia seeds equal roughly 27-30 grams dry, which is far too large. Since they are dispersed and swollen after soaking, their volume is much larger but weight remains small. The visual density is consistent with 2 teaspoons to 1 tablespoon dry weight approx 4 grams. This is reasonable given the jar size and other ingredients.

Therefore, the estimate is 4 grams for the chia seeds portion visible in the jar."

The specified food item is 'mélasse', which appears as a light brown spread on one slice of bread. The slice is a typical Swiss bread slice, roughly 40-60 grams total weight. The mélasse spread covers a moderate area of the bread with a thin visible layer. Considering typical syrup or molasses density and spread thickness on bread, a thin spread like this will likely weigh between 5 to 10 grams. Visually, it looks closer to about half a teaspoon or slightly more, which corresponds roughly to 6 to 8 grams of molasses. Checking by comparison, the nutella spread on the other slice is visibly thicker and spread wider, so the molasses portion is smaller. Therefore, the best estimate for the weight of the mélasse spread here is about 7 grams."

The specified food item is 'parmesan.' In the image, the visible main dish is risotto aux asperges, parmesan, but no distinct separate portion of parmesan cheese is clearly visible as a separate item on the plate. Typically, in such dishes, parmesan is grated and mixed in, often in small quantities relative to the bulk of the risotto. Given the amount of risotto portion on the plate, the parmesan would likely be around 5-10% of the total weight of the risotto serving. A typical risotto portion might weigh approximately 180-220 grams based on the plate size and visible portion. Assuming about 10% of this is parmesan cheese, a realistic weight estimate would be roughly 15-20 grams of parmesan mixed into this serving. Since no additional signs suggest more parmesan on top or on the side, a conservative estimate would be approximately 15 grams. This matches a reasonable portion for flavoring in such a serving. Cross-checking with usual cheese additions on risotto supports this estimate."

The specified food item is a 'barre de chocolat kinder', which visually corresponds to a Kinder Chocolate bar. From the image, this is a single bar about 10 cm long and with a thickness typical of the Kinder Chocolate bars sold in Switzerland. Standard Kinder Chocolate bars are known to weigh around 20 grams each. Given the absence of packaging but the clear visibility of a full bar, it is reasonable to estimate that the whole bar is present. Using the known weight for this product type and comparing its size to the wooden surface grain for scale, the estimate of 20 grams is consistent. Dual-method plausibility check: (1) Known retail weight ~20g per bar; (2) Visual size comparison (about 10 cm) matches standard bar dimensions and thickness; both align well within ±20%. Therefore, the estimated weight is 20 grams."

The image shows a piece of bread (pain) with a spread of crème de marrons on top. The food item to estimate is 'crème de marrons'. First, assess the bread portion size: it looks like a small to medium slice or roughly half a slice of standard Swiss bread. A standard Swiss bread slice weighs about 40-60 g, so this piece might weigh about 25-30 g. Next, evaluate the crème de marrons spread thickness and coverage. The spread covers the whole visible surface, and is relatively thick and glossy, suggesting a substantial layer rather than a thin smear. A thick spread on a small bread piece like this would typically be around 10-15 grams. Using household references (the spread thickness corresponds roughly to a heaped teaspoon of dense paste), the density and volume support an estimation in this range. Hence, the estimated weight of crème de marrons on this bread portion is about 12 grams. Cross-validating, this fits typical serving sizes and the visual thickness, with no indication of hidden layers or excessive volume. Therefore, 12 grams is a reasonable estimate."

The specified food item is 'beurre' (butter), which is the small rectangular pat positioned near the upper right part of the plate. The butter portion appears to be a single pat, about 3 cm long, 1.5 cm wide, and approximately 1 cm thick. Butter density is about 0.9 g/cm3. Using volume estimation: 3 cm × 1.5 cm × 1 cm = 4.5 cm3. Multiplying by density 0.9 g/cm3 gives about 4 grams. For validation: the butter pat is roughly the size of a chunk typically cut off from an individual butter stick for single use, commonly 3-5 g. This aligns well with standard single-use butter portions in Switzerland. Thus, the estimated weight is about 4 grams. Double-checking against the plate scale and knife nearby confirms the visual proportion is similar to a small butter pat rather than a larger slab. Therefore, the final estimate is 4 grams."

The specified food item is a ""barre de chocolat kinder,"" visible in the image as a single Kinder chocolate bar piece with the distinctive white and milk chocolate layers. This appears to be a regular Kinder chocolate bar segment, typically sold in individual sticks or bars. The average weight of a full Kinder chocolate bar (such as Kinder Bueno or Kinder Chocolate bar) ranges from about 20 g to 22 g per bar segment. The dimensions and thickness visible correspond to a standard single bar, not a mini or bite-sized version, and no packaging or additional content is shown, so I do not need to scale for partial consumption or emptiness. Considering Swiss and European packaging standards, a typical Kinder chocolate bar segment weighs approximately 21 g. This aligns with the visual observation and known product specifications. Cross-checking by volume and comparison to a similar-sized item confirms this weight is consistent. Therefore, the weight of the single ""barre de chocolat kinder"" in the image is about 21 grams."

The specified food item is a 'barre de chocolat kinder.' Visually, there is a single Kinder chocolate bar placed on a wooden surface. Kinder chocolate bars of this type (Kinder Bueno or Kinder Schoko-Bons style) typically weigh around 20 to 25 grams per bar. Judging by the scale compared to the wooden grain patterns and typical dimensions of this chocolate bar, it is a small portion bar, consistent with standard retail Kinder bars which usually weigh approximately 21 grams each. No packaging or additional portions are visible to suggest multiples or a bigger product. Using known Swiss packaging sizes and standard Kinder bar facts, the weight of this single bar is approximately 21 grams. Conducting a plausibility check: this weight fits typical Kinder bars, and given the visible size, this is the best estimate."
xjvrtk,galettes millet haricots noirs maïs,200.0,200,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/32289b41-a85a-4563-8e38-c47e7693d2d0,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The galettes millet haricots noirs maïs are the patties visible on the right center of the bowl. There appear to be two fairly large patties, roughly 8-9 cm in diameter each, and about 1 to 1.5 cm thick. Given their appearance and density (millet, black beans, and corn mixture), we can assume a density somewhat similar to cooked grains and legumes combined. Such galettes typically weigh between 80 to 120 g each, considering their compactness and ingredient moisture. For a Swiss-style homemade patty of this size, an estimate of about 100 g per patty is reasonable. Two patties would then weigh about 200 g total. Cross-checking with the bowl size (around 20 cm diameter) and the other food quantities, 200 g is consistent with the volume taken. The patties cover roughly a quarter to one-third of the bowl surface with moderate thickness, supporting this estimate. Therefore, the best estimate for the combined weight of the galettes millet haricots noirs maïs is 200 g."

The œuf dur (hard-boiled egg) is shown halved on the plate to the left. A typical Swiss large egg weighs 55-60 g whole with shell. The edible portion after shell removal is about 50-55 g. Since the egg is cut in half and both halves are shown, the whole edible egg is present. The size relative to the fork and knife supports it being a standard large egg. Thus, the weight of the œuf dur on the plate can be estimated as approximately 50 g."
