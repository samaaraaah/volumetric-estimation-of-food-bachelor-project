The image shows a blue bowl containing 14 distinct pineapple ('ananas') pieces. Each piece appears to be a triangular segment of pineapple with an average size approximately 5 cm long and 3 cm thick. Comparing the pineapple pieces to the bowl size (standard medium-sized bowl approximately 20 cm diameter), the pieces are medium-sized. Pineapple is a dense, juicy fruit with a density close to water, therefore its volume translates almost directly to weight. Assuming each piece weighs roughly 25 grams given their size and thickness, multiplying by 14 pieces gives approximately 350 grams. This is consistent with a medium portion typically served in Swiss contexts. I estimate the total weight of the pineapple pieces to be 350 grams."
2ahgvr,salade grecque,315.0,180,135.0,4.657721796276014,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/c476a6d0-acb2-45fd-b168-84822bc98003,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plastic container with a mixed Greek salad ('salade grecque'), which contains small diced pieces of cucumber, tomato, yellow bell pepper, onion rings, black olives, and small chunks of feta cheese. The salad fills approximately half to two-thirds of a standard small plastic container, which is roughly 10 cm long, 7 cm wide, and about 5 cm in height for the salad portion visible. The salad is diced finely, suggesting a compact volume but also some air gaps between pieces. Considering the density of the ingredients: vegetables such as cucumber and bell pepper are moderately dense and water-rich; olives and feta cheese add some density as well. Considering the visible quantity and density, the overall weight of the salad is likely in the medium portion range for a single serving. A reasonable estimate for this portion size of Greek salad is about 180 grams, as it accounts for the container size, diced pieces, and food density without including any sauce weight."
p96w4a,délice tomate mozzarella,54.0,180,126.0,0.7452354874041621,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/5ebafbd6-315d-44a6-8508-ba143d23adb2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'délice tomate mozzarella', which is visually identified on the left side of the plate, comprising alternating slices of tomato and mozzarella cheese with balsamic vinegar and herbs on top. Step 1: Visual Identification: There are 4 slices of tomato and 4 corresponding slices of mozzarella, layered in an alternating pattern. Step 2: Dimension Analysis: Each slice of tomato appears to be about 5-6 cm in diameter and about 0.8 cm thick. Mozzarella slices are roughly the same diameter but slightly thicker, about 1-1.2 cm. The total stack is roughly 7-8 slices thick due to layering overlap. Step 3: Density Considerations: Tomatoes are light in density, about 0.95 g/cm³, and mozzarella is denser, around 1.1 g/cm³, but soft. Considering the volume, the tomato slices appear fresh and moist, and the mozzarella looks like soft cow's milk mozzarella. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration: Given the number of slices and typical weight per slice, a single tomato slice weighs about 15-20g, so 4 slices would be roughly 60-80g. Mozzarella slices, being denser and thicker, likely weigh approximately 25-30g each, so 4 slices total 100-120g. Combining both, adjusting for balsamic and small oil drizzles (negligible weight), the total weight estimate of the délice tomate mozzarella is around 160-200g. Step 5: Cross-Validation: The portion fits on a standard dinner plate and aligns well with typical Swiss portion sizes for such an appetizer. Therefore, a medium portion estimate near the middle of the range seems accurate. I estimate the weight of the délice tomate mozzarella to be 180 grams."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,300,117.0,5.343811610076671,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate containing a tomato salad (salade de tomates) topped with visible seeds of lin (graines de lin) and some green herbs, with balsamic vinegar as dressing. Focusing only on the salad de tomates, I count roughly 12-14 tomato wedges, which appear to be cut from medium-sized tomatoes. Each wedge seems about 4-5 cm long, and considering the plate size and the knife/fork for scale, the total volume is moderate. Tomatoes are dense but mostly water, so their density is low-medium. The tomato wedges seem to be about 1.5-2 cm thick. Estimating by number and size: one medium tomato weighs approximately 150 grams; here, the slices are about the equivalent of 2 medium tomatoes in volume. Hence, the tomato portion is approximately 280-320 grams. The balsamic vinegar is minimal and not included, and the lin seeds weigh very little compared to the tomatoes and are not counted here as they are a seasoning, not the target food. Therefore, the estimated weight of the salade de tomates alone is about 300 grams."
2ahgvr,porridge salé,48.0,165,117.0,0.6151150054764513,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a35f3211-3b33-4826-97b8-3af69655dada,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small glass jar filled almost to the top with porridge salé (savory porridge). The jar is placed on a car dashboard, with the vent grille providing a reference for size. Car vent grille slots are typically about 1.5 cm in width. The jar appears to have a diameter of about 6-7 cm and a visible height of around 7-8 cm filled with porridge. The porridge is compact and dense, typical of cooked oats with liquid. Given the jar's size and the porridge density, this portion seems equivalent to roughly 150-180 grams of cooked porridge. Considering this is a Swiss portion context and the jar is not unusually large, I estimate the weight of the porridge salé in the jar to be approximately 165 grams."
p96w4a,purée de pdt,214.0,120,94.0,2.2032858707557503,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/828972fc-fa12-4270-a960-fc59367fc91e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'purée de pdt' (mashed potatoes) on the plate. Visually, it is a flat but thick layer under the meat stew and sauce. The mashed potatoes cover roughly half of the plate's diameter, which is a standard dinner plate around 24 cm diameter. Estimating the portion as roughly 12 cm by 8 cm in surface area, and thickness about 1.5 cm, gives a volume of around 144 cubic cm. Potato puree is moderately dense, about 0.85 g/cm³ considering added milk and butter. This gives an approximate weight of 144 * 0.85 ≈ 122 grams. Given this is Swiss portion size and the portion looks medium-sized, I estimate around 120 grams for the mashed potatoes portion, excluding the sauce and other ingredients."
ppf8hc,pâtes carbonara,236.0,145,91.0,2.3522453450164296,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/4d4e6539-b86f-4019-b2aa-0c15dbce0667,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with a serving of pâtes carbonara topped with grated gruyère. First, I locate the pâtes carbonara on the plate, which are the creamy pasta pieces mixed with small bacon bits. The pasta portion appears moderate, spread out but not heaping, with pieces clearly visible. The plate size and visible tableware (such as the glass in the background) acts as a reference, suggesting a Swiss-sized portion rather than an oversized US portion. The pasta pieces look like a typical cooked penne and similar shapes, with likely a depth of about 2-3 cm in the piled parts. Considering the density of cooked pasta with sauce and bacon, the weight is denser than it might appear. Given the portion size, I estimate the plated pasta carbonara weighs between 130-160 grams, with an approximate medium-sized portion around 145 grams. Since the question targets only pâtes carbonara (excluding the gruyère topping), the estimate only considers the pasta with sauce and bacon. Thus, I estimate the weight of the pâtes carbonara portion to be about 145 grams."
ppf8hc,boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate,316.0,225,91.0,3.149616648411829,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/bf22a1b3-a8b6-4823-a44b-0893c3097763,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate.' Step 1: The image shows 9 visible vegetable meatballs on top of pasta. They are mostly round and fairly uniform in size. Step 2: Each boulettes appears about the size of a medium walnut, roughly 3-4 cm in diameter. Given their round shape and dense vegetable content with tomato sauce coating, their volume should be estimated accordingly. Step 3: Vegetable meatballs have moderate density, slightly less than meat meatballs due to vegetable fiber content, but still compact. The tomato sauce layer adds some moisture but negligible weight. Step 4: A medium-sized vegetable meatball in Swiss portioning could weigh roughly 25 grams. With 9 balls visible, multiplying gives 225 grams as the mid-range estimate. Considering size variation and slight sauce wetness, weight may vary ±20%, but I'll keep the solid middle estimate. Step 5: No visible hidden boulettes under the others, so no upward adjustment is needed beyond the count. The total estimated weight of the 9 vegetable meatballs in tomato sauce is around 225 grams."
8japfq,ratatouille,196.0,110,86.0,1.846221248630887,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/b6659a8f-25e7-44f7-a351-7873f60f1586,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is ratatouille, which is located at the top right section of the plate. It consists of cooked vegetable chunks including eggplant, zucchini, tomato, and possibly peppers, all stewed together. The portion visible is a roughly heaped scoop approximately 8 cm wide, 5 cm deep, and about 2.5 cm thick, making it about 100 cm3 in volume. Considering cooked vegetables have a density close to water but somewhat denser due to fiber and sauce content, an estimated density of about 1.1 g/cm3 is appropriate. Thus, 100 cm3 translates to roughly 110 grams. The portion size is moderate, not a small or overly large serving. Therefore, I estimate the ratatouille weight to be around 110 grams."

The target food item is ""gaufre à la patate douce"" which are sweet potato waffles visible as four triangular pieces arranged on a plate. Each piece is about 7-8 cm wide and 3 cm thick as gauged against the size of a standard dessert plate. The waffles look dense but not overly thick, typical of sweet potato waffles which combine cooked sweet potato and batter. Each triangular piece likely weighs around 40-45 grams given the density and volume. There are 4 pieces in total, so the total weight would be roughly between 160 and 180 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes which are smaller than US portions, a medium portion estimate is about 170 grams for this amount of sweet potato waffles."
xjvrtk,tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe,250.0,165,85.0,2.3274917853231107,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/f607625b-a07d-423e-a564-4d96ebadf084,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single slice of tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe on a standard dessert plate. The slice appears to be roughly a quarter of a typical 25 cm diameter tarte flambée. The topping includes diced rhubarb and sliced apple pieces embedded in a custard-like base spread on a thin crust. The crust looks thin and light, typical of Alsatian tarte flambée dough. The rhubarb and apple chunks appear cooked and softened but still substantial in volume. Considering the toppings' density (fruit pieces with some cream base), and the thin crust, a whole tarte usually weighs around 600-700 grams. A quarter slice would therefore weigh between 150 and 175 grams. Given the visible thickness and generous topping, I estimate this slice at the medium range, approximately 165 grams."
wrah5h,polenta,209.0,130,79.0,1.808433734939759,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/f727ac79-973e-4b92-8f2b-cda94222d4a7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'polenta,' located on the right side of the container, topped with shredded cheese. Visually, the portion of polenta is approximately shaped like a small mound about 7 cm long, 5 cm wide, and an estimated 3-4 cm thick, considering the height under the cheese. Compared to the metal container and the adjacent grilled aubergine and pork, this portion is moderate in size. Polenta is a cooked grain product with medium density, and the shredded cheese on top adds some weight but is considered separate here. Typically, a medium portion of polenta served in Swiss portion standards would be between 100 and 140 grams. Given the size and volume visible in this image, and accounting for some depth and density, I estimate the weight of the polenta to be around 130 grams."
wrah5h,"délice des dieux (biscuit, fruits rouges, séré+mascarpone)",205.0,130,75.0,1.6840087623220152,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/5de398c7-684b-448d-ba0a-f318d009bccd,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a slice of 'délice des dieux' dessert, with visible layers: a biscuit base soaked with fruit juice, a creamy layer likely composed of séré and mascarpone, and topped with fresh red fruits (raspberries and blueberries). Step 1: The dessert slice is a single portion, roughly rectangular but with some irregular edges; it's about the size of a small dessert plate segment (estimated around 8 cm x 6 cm). There are 2 blueberries and 2 raspberries visible on top. Step 2: In terms of dimensions, the height/thickness appears approximately 3 to 4 cm (considering the visible creamy layer and biscuit base combined). Step 3: Considering the density, the biscuit soaked with fruit juice is moderately dense but somewhat moist, the cream layer is light but substantial in weight due to mascarpone, and the fruits add light, low weight volume. Step 4: Given Swiss dessert portion sizes, a medium-sized dessert slice of this kind generally weighs between 110 and 150 grams. Given the portion is visibly moist and contains rich cream, I estimate the weight mid-range, around 130 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation confirms this is consistent with standard portions of such mixed creamy fruit desserts. Therefore, the estimated weight of this 'délice des dieux' slice is approximately 130 grams."
2ahgvr,brochette de boeuf,76.0,150,74.0,0.6159912376779847,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/5b8a0853-ecc4-4015-bc9a-2b50766f873a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The brochette de boeuf is located on the plate towards the top, composed of three large cubes of cooked beef skewered on a wooden stick. Each beef cube appears to be about 3-4 cm in length, width, and height, with good thickness all around. Comparing the size to the slice of bread next to it, which is typically around 35-40 grams for this size, the brochette de boeuf pieces are roughly similar in volume to a medium meat portion. Beef is a dense food, so even small volumes correspond to higher weights. Estimating each cube to weigh about 45-55 grams, three pieces total between 135-165 grams. Given the visible density, juicy cooked texture, and standard portion size for a brochette in Swiss contexts (where portions tend smaller than US), I select the middle-to-lower end of this range. Thus, I estimate the weight of the brochette de boeuf to be approximately 150 grams."
xjvrtk,courgette et oignons,300.0,370,70.0,2.3001095290251916,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a glass container with two distinct food items: sautéed courgette et oignons (zucchini and onions) on the left side, and galettes millet haricots noirs maïs on the right. Focusing exclusively on the courgette et oignons, I count numerous small pieces of diced zucchini and onions mixed together. The pieces seem chopped finely, and the portion occupies roughly half the container volume-wise. Comparing the size of the container to the typical hand size and desk context, this container appears to be around 15cm x 15cm in area and about 4-5cm deep, suggesting a capacity of approximately 900-1100 ml in total. The courgette and onion portion fills about half of it, giving an estimated volume of approximately 450-550 ml. Cooked zucchini and onions are medium density vegetables, and given the sautéed state (some water loss due to cooking but moisture retained), density is roughly 0.7 to 0.9 g/ml. Multiplying the approximate volume of 500 ml by density ~0.8 g/ml provides a mass estimate around 400 grams. Given the Swiss portion size tends to be smaller than US, this portion seems medium-large, so I will adjust slightly down to 370 grams to be conservative."

The image shows a slice of tiramisu on a plate, located on the left side of the plate. The tiramisu slice appears to be a medium portion with layers of sponge soaked in coffee and cream layers on top and between. The slice is about 10 cm long, 5 cm wide, and approximately 4 cm thick. Considering the density of tiramisu, which is fairly moist and creamy but not very dense like dense cakes, the weight per cubic centimeter is moderate. Using this and the visible volume, the tiramisu slice's weight is estimated to be between 120 and 150 grams. Given the portion size appears medium, I select the middle of this range for the estimate, approximately 135 grams."

The target food item is 'kiwi', visible as peeled, sliced pieces covering about half the surface of the bowl. I count approximately 20 individual kiwi pieces in various sizes. The bowl is medium-sized, and the kiwi slices appear to be roughly 2-3 cm in length and about 1-1.5 cm thick. Kiwis have a water-rich, dense texture, so their density is moderate to high compared to light foods. Given typical Swiss portion sizes and the visible amount here, each kiwi slice weighs approximately 8-10 grams on average. Multiplying by 20 pieces, the total weighs around 160-200 grams. Considering the partial visibility and some pieces being smaller, a reasonable estimation for the portion of kiwi is approximately 180 grams."

The image shows a metal container with three distinct food portions: grilled aubergine slices in the top left corner, a heap of polenta with shredded cheese on the right, and a piece of pork covered with a white sauce in the bottom left. The target food item is 'porc'. Visually, there is one piece of pork, roughly rectangular, about 8 cm long, 5 cm wide, and 1.5-2 cm thick. The pork is dense meat, which has significant weight relative to its size. The white sauce on top is light and thin, so I will not include much for it—only the meat itself. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes which are smaller than in the US, and the dense nature of cooked pork, this piece likely weighs between 90 and 130 grams. Given the moderate size and thickness, I estimate a medium portion, around 110 grams for the pork."

The image shows a white bowl with mixed rice and dahl de lentille. The dahl de lentille appears as the orange lentil and vegetable mixture visible on the top layer and mixed throughout the rice. The bowl is medium-sized, likely around 12-14 cm in diameter. The dahl de lentille occupies roughly half to slightly more than half of the bowl's content by volume, the rest being white rice. Considering the bowl depth is around 6-7 cm and the food is compacted but not densely packed, the total content volume is moderate. Dahl de lentille, being cooked lentils with vegetables and a moist sauce, has a density near that of cooked legumes, approximately 0.9-1 g/cm3. Based on this, the dahl de lentille portion appears to be about 200-250 grams. This is a medium portion, suitable for a Swiss standard serving size of such a dish. I estimate the weight of the dahl de lentille at 225 grams."

The image shows one yellow bell pepper (poivron jaune) partially filled with quinoa and bulgur curry, with two detached slices of yellow pepper on the plate. For the estimation, I focus only on the yellow pepper pieces, excluding the quinoa-bulgur mixture. The pepper is medium-sized, as compared to the plate and fork in the background, which appear to be standard Swiss kitchenware. The whole yellow pepper without seeds typically weighs around 120 to 140 grams. Since part of the pepper has been removed and some slices are separated, the visible pepper portion corresponds to roughly 70-80% of a whole pepper's volume. Considering the volume and thickness, and that cooked peppers lose some water but remain dense, I estimate the visible yellow pepper pieces to weigh approximately 95 grams."

The target food is 'chili', which is the reddish stew on the right side of the plate containing pieces of cervelas and kidney beans in a tomato-based sauce. Visually, the chili occupies about half of a standard dinner plate, with visible chunks of meat and beans, suggesting a moderately dense portion. The depth is estimated to be about 2 to 3 cm as the chili appears somewhat thick and piled but spread evenly. Compared to the pasta on the left, which is a medium portion, the chili portion seems to be medium-sized as well. Considering cooked meat and beans are dense foods, I estimate the chili weighs between 200 and 270 grams. Choosing the middle to upper mid-range for this portion's thickness and density, I estimate the chili weight to be approximately 240 grams."

Step 1: visually identifying the slice, I see about 6 medium-sized halved strawberries and a few red currants on top of a creamy layer with a visible thin pastry crust. Step 2: comparing the slice to the plate, the slice is roughly 10 cm long, 5 cm wide, and about 3 cm thick including the creamy layer and fruit. The crust is thin but dense, while the creamy filling has moderate density, and the fruit is fresh and dense. Step 3: accounting for density, the pastry crust is denser than the cream and fruit, so overall the slice has a medium density. Step 4: portion size: it is a moderate slice typical of Swiss dessert portions, not oversized. Step 5: cross-validation confirms the estimate is reasonable given visible dimensions and density. Estimating the combined weight: crust about 30g, cream about 40g, strawberries about 40g (6 halves approx. 7g each), red currants about 5g. Summing these parts, the total weight is approximately 115 grams."

The target food item is 'céréales' visible in a white bowl partially filled with milk. The cereals appear as small flakes and some chocolate pieces, dispersed evenly in the milk. The bowl is a standard sized breakfast bowl, roughly about 18 cm in diameter, helping provide scale. The cereal layer is thin, with an approximate cereal depth of around 1 cm given the visible thickness and amount of milk. Considering the light and fluffy nature of cereals, which usually weigh between 20-40 grams per standard bowl serving, and accounting for Swiss portion sizes which tend to be smaller, this looks like a medium to small portion. Also, some cereals absorb milk and appear larger but remain lightweight. Estimating visually and accounting for the cereal density and volume visible, the portion of cereals here is about 30 grams."
wrah5h,haricots rouges,91.0,45,46.0,0.45848849945235487,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1550c506-8c95-461f-b658-8f427dc2a0af,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is the 'haricots rouges' (red kidney beans) located on the left side of the plate. Visually, these beans are whole, with slight seasoning (small green herb bits) and appear moist and cooked. I counted roughly 30-35 individual beans visible, and they are somewhat piled forming a loose cluster about 7 cm long and 5 cm wide, approximately 1.5-2 cm deep based on the shadow and volume. Comparing to the plate size and the adjacent pasta portion, each bean seems normal-sized but not overly large. Red kidney beans are dense foods, so they have considerable weight for their size. A standard cooked kidney bean weighs about 1-1.3 grams. Multiplying roughly 35 beans by an average of 1.2 grams each gives 42 grams approximately. Considering some may be hidden under others and moisture content, a slight upward adjustment to 45 grams is reasonable. This portion corresponds to a medium Swiss-sized side serving. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the haricots rouges to be approximately 45 grams."

The image shows a small bowl containing five strawberries (fraises). The strawberries vary in size, but all seem to be medium-sized, larger than typical small Swiss portions but not oversized. The bowl provides a reference: a small ceramic bowl about 10-12 cm in diameter commonly weighs about 200-300g when full with a few strawberries. Each strawberry appears roughly 4-5 cm in length and about 3-4 cm in width and depth. Strawberries are relatively light and dense, with an average berry weighing between 15-25 grams depending on size. The largest strawberries here are probably closer to 25 grams, while the smaller ones closer to 15 grams. There are five strawberries, so estimating about 20 grams each on average is reasonable for a mixed size group. Multiplying gives approximately 100 grams total. Considering slight size and density variations, and possible slight compaction, the total estimated weight of the fraises in the bowl is approximately 100 grams."

The image shows a transparent glass bowl containing a creamy chocolate yogurt in scoops, with some visible swirls indicating chocolate flavor. I focus only on the chocolate yogurt as requested. The portion sits in a small bowl, and comparing it to the bowl size and typical table surface reflections, the amount looks modest, approximately filling less than half of a small bowl that could hold around 200g if filled fully. Considering the density of yogurt, which is close to water in weight (around 1g/cm³), and the volume visually measured as roughly 125-140 ml, the weight is likely in the range of 120-140 grams. Given this is a single serving and looks average in size (medium portion for Swiss standards), I estimate the weight to be about 130 grams."
m4egh2,"salade de pâtes, cornichon, fromage, tomate",82.0,125,43.0,0.38619934282584883,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/7ff5fe61-b9cd-45c6-8df8-44a690a86b0c,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food items are 'salade de pâtes, cornichon, fromage, tomate' as listed. First, locating these items in the image: the 'salade de pâtes' is the portion of elbow-shaped cooked pasta mixed with small pieces of cornichon visible on the top right of the plate; it appears as a small but dense mound. The cornichon pieces within the pasta salad are small, cut pieces integrated within, so their weight is part of the pasta salad. Aside from those, there are no additional separate visible cornichon slices. The 'fromage' is not overtly visible as discrete chunks or slices on the plate, so it is likely integrated and minimal, meaning mostly accounted in the pasta salad but not separately visible. The 'tomate' is represented by one bright red cherry tomato on a skewer on the bottom right of the plate next to the prawns. Counting this as one whole tomato item. Dimension analysis: The pasta salad portion is approximately 7 cm wide, 4 cm thick, and 5 cm deep. Considering cooked pasta is dense, a portion this size roughly corresponds to 90-110 grams. The single cherry tomato is about 3-4 cm diameter, typical weight about 15-20 grams. The cornichon inside the pasta salad is already factored into this weight estimation as chopped pieces. Since cheese is not distinctly visible, I will conservatively estimate it as minimal weight, at around 10 grams if it is present but unseen. For portion size calibration given Swiss smaller portions, pasta salad here is medium in size, so I take the midrange estimate. Summing: 100 grams for salad de pâtes (including cornichon), plus 15 grams for tomato, plus 10 grams for fromage. Therefore, total estimated weight of 'salade de pâtes, cornichon, fromage, tomate' is about 125 grams."
p8a2w5,yogourt industriel à l'abricot avec morceaux,171.0,130,41.0,0.767907995618839,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/e4f800da-c429-4a04-823c-ac3792f64c00,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a white bowl partly filled with industrial apricot yogurt containing visible fruit pieces. The bowl is a standard size, approximately 12-14 cm in diameter judging by the partial view of a laptop and table surface for scale. The yogurt fills the bowl to a shallow depth, roughly estimated at 3-4 cm with some visible texture and small fruit pieces dispersed throughout. Apricot yogurt is a dense but soft mixture with some fruit chunks adding slight extra weight. Considering the visible volume, typical density of fruit yogurt, and Swiss portion norms (generally smaller than US portions), this appears to be a moderate snack portion. Standard single-serve industrial yogurts typically weigh around 125-150 grams. Given the visual volume and density, I estimate the weight of the apricot industrial yogurt with pieces in the bowl to be approximately 130 grams."

The target food item is 'mozarella', which is clearly located on the left side of the plate as a single rounded piece of soft white cheese. It's about the size of half a palm or a medium-sized scoop, approximately 7-8 cm wide and about 2-3 cm thick. Comparing it with the olives on the plate and the plate size (typical dinner plate ~25 cm diameter), the mozarella is a small portion but dense, typical for fresh mozzarella. Fresh mozzarella usually weighs between 100-150 grams for a medium-sized ball. Since this is a single portion and appears smaller than typical US servings but consistent with Swiss portion sizes, I estimate the weight closer to the medium to lower end of that range. Thus, I estimate the mozarella to weigh about 110 grams."
m4egh2,pâtes,138.0,100,38.0,0.5743702081051478,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/32c03d9e-2971-4f4b-bbec-4efde05dbf93,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'pâtes' (pasta). The image shows a portion of tagliatelle-like pasta with mushroom cream sauce and a side of gratinée courgettes, but I will focus only on the pasta. The pasta is visibly cooked, flat, and wide noodles laid on a medium-sized plate. Comparing pasta size to the plate (approximately 25 cm diameter) and relative to the courgette slices, the pasta portion is moderate, occupying about a third of the plate area. The pasta is compact but not piled very high, with some sauce mixed in. Considering the pasta's density as cooked pasta, it is dense and relatively heavy. A typical small Swiss cooked pasta portion is about 80-120 grams. Given this portion appears medium rather than large or very small, I estimate it at the midpoint, approximately 100 grams."
6fwmw2,perle de blé,138.0,100,38.0,0.5743702081051478,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/6fwmw2/dish_media/1da85bf5-675f-472d-8594-733069301dd5,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'perle de blé', the wheat pearls, which are visible as small round grains mostly yellowish white, mixed with sauce and shrimp at the bottom left side of the bowl. The bowl helps give a size scale, it's a standard small to medium-sized bowl, and the wheat pearls occupy roughly one third of the bowl's volume. Considering the size of the pearls, their typical density (cooked, dense and compact), and the fact they are mixed with sauce making the portion slightly heavier, I estimate the total portion of perle de blé in this bowl to be a medium serving weighing between 90 to 110 grams. I select a mid-range estimate of approximately 100 grams for the perle de blé."

The target food item is 'boulgour', which is the light beige grain occupying the lower-left half of the glass container. It is clearly visible and not mixed with other foods. Visually, it appears as cooked bulgur, which is dense and compact. The portion covers about half of the container's base and appears layered approximately 2-3 cm thick. Comparing the bulgur to the adjacent halved hard-boiled egg and ratatouille, and considering a typical Swiss food portion context (smaller than US sizes), this is a medium-sized portion. Given the density of cooked bulgur and the volume observed, I estimate the weight range between 120 to 150 grams. Selecting the middle of this range aligns with the visual volume and density. Therefore, the estimated weight of the bulgur is approximately 135 grams."

The target food item is 'purée cacahuète' (peanut butter). Visually, the peanut butter is the smooth dollop on the left side of the plate, separate from the oatmeal, chocolate chips, and half banana. There is one contiguous portion of peanut butter visible. Comparing it to the half banana nearby and the oat flakes, the portion looks quite small, roughly 3 to 4 tablespoons in volume. The plate is a standard-sized plate (approximately 25 cm diameter). Given the thick, dense consistency of peanut butter, 1 tablespoon is around 15 grams. Visually estimating about 3 tablespoons equals roughly 45 grams. To be conservative and consistent with Swiss portion sizes, I estimate the weight to be between 40 and 50 grams, selecting the middle to lower middle for a small-medium portion. Therefore, I estimate the purée cacahuète to be approximately 45 grams."

The image shows a blue bowl with a light beige creamy dessert identified as crème caramel. The portion is held by a hand, which helps estimate size. The bowl diameter is roughly that of a small dessert bowl, about 12-14 cm across. The crème caramel inside appears to cover the bottom in a somewhat thick layer with some peaks, but not filled to the top. The visible amount looks like approximately 5-6 cm in diameter and about 2-3 cm thick, suggesting a volume roughly equivalent to about 70-90 ml of creamy material. Crème caramel is fairly dense, similar in density to custard or pudding, so estimation in grams will be close to milliliters in volume. Considering Swiss portion sizes for this type of dessert are modest, the portion shown is likely in the medium range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the crème caramel to be about 80 grams."

The target food item is 'tomate'. In the image, the tomato pieces are located on the left side of the container and are bright red, cut into a few wedges and laid next to the avocado slices. Counting the visible pieces, there are about 3 to 4 tomato wedges. Each wedge appears to be approximately 4-5 cm in length with a width and depth around 2 cm. Tomatoes have a moderate density, fairly water-rich. Considering the visual size in relation to other ingredients and depth, the total volume suggests a medium portion. Small tomatoes wedges typically weigh about 20-25 grams each. Multiplying by 3 to 4 wedges and selecting a middle value in range, I estimate the total weight of the tomato pieces to be around 80 grams."

The image shows one rectangular gaufre (waffle) on a medium-sized plate decorated with colorful fish patterns. The gaufre appears to be of standard Swiss portion size, which is smaller than US waffles. The approximate dimensions of the gaufre look to be about 10 cm by 7 cm with a thickness of about 1.5 cm, considering the depth of the waffle's grid. The waffle is not covered entirely by compote, so the compote does not affect the weight estimation of just the gaufre. The waffle texture looks dense but airy, typical for such products, suggesting moderate density. Based on Swiss portion norms and visual size, a single gaufre of this size usually weighs between 70 and 90 grams. Given the moderate thickness and size seen, I estimate this one to be around 80 grams."

The target food item is 'sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon)', which is the mushroom cream sauce visible in the bowl. Visually, the sauce is mixed with the pasta, but the creamy mushroom pieces can be located clearly on top and between pasta ribbons. The sauce contains several sliced mushrooms, which appear cooked but still have volume and density. I count around 6 to 7 medium mushroom pieces visible, coated in a creamy sauce. Given the density of cream and mushrooms, and considering some sauce likely coats the pasta as well, but focusing only on the visible sauce portion separate from plain pasta, the sauce portion is moderate. The volume looks roughly like a small ladle amount (about 100 to 130 ml) of thick sauce, which usually weighs around 120-140 grams due to the cream and mushrooms' density. Considering the Swiss smaller portion size context, I estimate a medium portion at about 130 grams of sauce aux champignons in this serving."

The image shows a white bowl containing milk and cereal clusters with pieces of chocolate. The target food item is 'cereales' which I identify as the cereal clusters along with the chocolate pieces in the milk. Visually, the cereal covers a portion of the bowl's surface and seems to be floating or partially submerged in the milk. The clusters vary in size but mostly appear medium-sized (roughly 2-3 cm per cluster). Counting roughly, there are about 20-25 clusters plus some smaller crumbs and chocolate bits. Considering the visible surface area and some cereal being submerged and hidden under milk, I estimate that the total cereal portion is moderately sized. Cereal is generally lightweight but dense enough to add some weight. Given the average density and Swiss portion context which tends to be smaller, the internal weight range might be about 25-40 grams. Judging by the quantity, I estimate a medium portion at about 33 grams. The milk is not included in the estimation as per instructions."

The image shows a full glass bottle labeled 'GINGER' which is a ginger tonic. The bottle size looks like a standard glass beverage bottle typical in Switzerland, roughly 200-250 ml capacity based on visual comparison to the nearby glass cup and smartphone. The density of tonic ginger is close to water, so 1 ml weighs close to 1 gram. Assuming the bottle is full or nearly full, the weight of the liquid content (tonic au gingembre) can be approximated by the liquid volume. Considering the appearance and context, I estimate the bottle holds about 230 ml of tonic, which corresponds to approximately 230 grams for the tonic liquid alone. Bottle weight is excluded as per instructions."

The target food items are the cheeses: manchego, two types of gruyères, and raclette, which are laid out as four distinct slices on a plate alongside a piece of rustic bread. For each cheese slice, I first counted the number of individual pieces: there are four total slices. Each slice is thin, roughly 1-2 mm thick, and sizes vary slightly but average about 5 cm by 3 cm in surface area. Using the bread slice as a size reference, the cheese slices look typical for a Swiss tasting portion. Cheese is a dense food, meaning it weighs more than it appears per volume. Typical cheese slice weights for such portions range from about 15 to 25 grams per slice depending on thickness and density. Given that the cheese slices are quite thin and relatively small, I estimate each slice to weigh about 15–18 grams. Multiplying by four slices gives a total weight range of roughly 60 to 72 grams. Since the slices are fairly uniform and none is notably thick or thin, I select a medium portion estimate close to 65 grams for the total cheese quantity. Therefore, the estimated weight for the combined cheeses (manchego, 2 gruyères, raclette) is 65 grams."

The salade de céleri is the shredded white vegetable portion on the bottom right of the plate. It appears as a moist, finely shredded celery root salad, likely dressed with a light sauce. Visually, the pile is roughly the size of a small handful, occupying about a quarter of the plate’s surface. Comparing it to the other items, the celery salad is similar in height to the carrot salad but slightly denser. Given that celery root salads typically have moderate density – heavier than leafy vegetables but lighter than cooked grains – and the portion is moderate in size, the estimated weight range is between 60 and 90 grams. Considering the Swiss portion style which tends to be smaller, I place the final estimate near the medium portion range at approximately 75 grams."

The target food item is 'sauce'. The sauce is the brown liquid surrounding and partly covering the mashed potatoes, beef stew meat, and carrots on the plate. It is spread thinly and covers most of the plate's visible surface near the food. Using the plate diameter and size of the other food items (e.g., carrot pieces approximately 7-8 cm long) as a reference, the sauce forms a relatively thin layer. Given the density of typical meat stew sauce, and that the sauce volume is roughly around 2-3 tablespoons, I estimate the sauce weight to be approximately 30-40 grams. Considering this is a Swiss portion, more toward the lower-medium portion weight is appropriate, so I finalize the estimate at 35 grams."

The target food item is 'toast'. Visually, there are two slices of toast on a plate, and they appear to be standard sliced bread toasted to a medium level. Each slice is about 10 cm by 10 cm in surface area, which is typical for single slices of bread in Swiss or European contexts. The thickness of the pieces is approximately 1.5 cm. Toast is fairly dense but lighter than a fresh slice of bread due to water loss. Considering a standard slice of whole wheat or multigrain bread usually weighs around 30-35 grams fresh, the toasting reduces moisture but not much weight loss, so each slice of toast would still be close to 30 grams. Since the question asks for the weight of one slice of toast, I estimate about 30 grams per slice. This estimate excludes any topping or spread weight, only the bread toast itself."

The image shows a metal bowl containing muesli with a small amount of natural yogurt partially visible. The target food item is 'muesli nature'. The muesli covers almost the entire visible surface of the bowl, with some yogurt peeking through. By visual estimation, the bowl diameter corresponds roughly to a medium-sized cereal bowl, which likely holds around 250-300 ml volume. The muesli looks dry and loose with some sunflower seeds and oats, typical density roughly 0.35 to 0.4 g/ml. Given the bowl space occupied by muesli, about 200 ml of volume seems reasonable. Multiplying by density gives approximately 70-80 grams. Considering this is a typical serving for Swiss portions and the granola is not compacted, I estimate the amount of muesli nature to be around 75 grams."

The target food item is 'pain' (bread). Each slice of bread appears to be a standard slice of homemade or bakery-style rustic bread with a fairly thick crust and dense interior. Comparing the slices to the plate's diameter and typical Swiss bread portions which are generally smaller than US ones, each slice seems to weigh approximately 40-45 grams. Both slices are similarly sized, and there are two slices present, but since the target is one piece of 'pain', I estimate the weight of one slice to be around 43 grams on average."

The target food item is ""houmous au basilic (acheté)"" which is visible in the small glass placed slightly above the plate. It appears as a creamy paste with a slight greenish tint. The small glass is about the size of a standard small condiment glass, roughly 6 cm in height and 5 cm diameter. The glass is filled approximately to about 2.5 cm deep with the hummus. Given the dimensions, this corresponds to roughly 50-60 ml volume. Hummus has a density close to soft pastes, about 1 g/cm3, so volume in ml roughly converts to grams. Considering the small volume and visual density, the weight of the ""houmous au basilic"" in the glass is estimated between 50 and 60 grams. Since the portion looks moderate for a side serving, I estimate it at about 55 grams."

The avocado slice is located in the lower-left area of the plate, appearing as a single piece that is around 6 cm long and about 2 cm thick at the widest point. Its shape and size are consistent with a medium-sized avocado slice. Comparing it to the adjacent bread piece and chicken skewers confirms the scale. Avocado is dense and creamy, so the weight is relatively high for its volume. Given Swiss portion context, this piece of avocado likely weighs between 40 and 60 grams. Considering the visible size as a medium portion, I estimate the weight to be approximately 50 grams."

The target food item is 'caviar d'aubergine'. In the image, it is the spread on the slice of bread at the upper middle part of the plate. The slice of bread is a medium-sized piece of seed bread, likely around 15 cm long and 7-8 cm wide, with a moderate thickness of about 1.5 cm. The caviar d'aubergine layer covers the bread evenly but thinly. Typically, such a spread layer on bread can be estimated around 5-8 mm thickness given the visible consistency. The density of eggplant caviar is moderate, similar to a purée or thick spread. A reasonable estimate for the entire spread covering this bread slice is approximately 25-30 grams. This accounts for the thin spread over a full slice of bread, which itself is not included in the weight per the instructions. Thus, considering the portion size and density, the estimated weight of the caviar d'aubergine alone is about 28 grams."

The target food item is ""yogourt orange sanguine,"" which is mixed with the cereal and blueberries in the bowl. The bowl contains a creamy mixture where the yogurt is clearly the base, binding the cereal and fruit together. The bowl is of medium size, about the size of a standard breakfast bowl, likely around 15-18 cm in diameter. The yogurt appears to fill roughly half to two-thirds of the total volume of the mixture in the bowl. Estimating the total volume of the mixture in the bowl as approximately 300-350 ml (a standard single-serving cereal bowl size), the yogurt portion (liquid/creamy part) can be estimated at about 180-220 grams. Considering the density of yogurt, similar to water at about 1 g/ml, and the presence of fruit and cereal making up some volume but less dense, I will estimate the actual yogurt content weight at the lower end of this range to adjust for mixing with cereals and blueberries. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the ""yogourt orange sanguine"" to be approximately 190 grams."

First, I locate the cervelas within the chili portion on the right side of the plate. The cervelas pieces are visible as chunky, pinkish-orange meat cubes mixed throughout the chili. I count and estimate an average of about 10 pieces of cervelas visible on the plate. Each piece appears roughly 3-4 cm in length and about 2-3 cm in width, with a moderate thickness. Considering the cervelas density as a processed sausage meat, it is relatively dense and compact. The volume of cervelas pieces on the plate seems to fill about a third of the chili section, which is piled moderately deep. Estimating volume and typical density of cervelas, around 1.1g/cm3, and comparing to the other items on a standard Swiss size plate (approx. 22-24cm diameter), I determine the weight range of cervelas on the plate to be between 120g (small portion) and 180g (large portion). Given the portion looks medium-sized, I select a middle estimate of about 150 grams for the cervelas on this plate."

The target food item is the 'bout de gruyère,' which is a long rectangular slice of cheese placed between the croissants and the sliced meats on the plate. Visually, it is approximately 12 cm long, about 2 cm wide, and around 1.5 cm thick based on comparison to the carrot sticks and baguette pieces nearby. Gruyère is a dense cheese, so its weight per volume is relatively high. Given these dimensions, the volume is roughly 36 cubic centimeters. Considering Gruyère's density to be about 1.1 g/cm3, this piece likely weighs around 40 grams. The portion looks medium-sized for a cheese slice served with a meal, so 40 grams is a reasonable and accurate estimate based on the visual evidence and Swiss portion norms."

The target food item is 'cottage cheese aux herbes,' visible on the plate as a small pile of white curds mixed with herbs, located near the fried egg and hummous. Step 1: Visual Identification - The portion appears as a modest serving, roughly a small scoop of cottage cheese. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The pile is about 3 cm wide, 2 cm deep, and roughly 1.5 cm thick. Compared to the adjacent foods (e.g., the egg and the olives), it's a small but distinct quantity. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cottage cheese is relatively dense and moist; 1 tablespoon typically weighs around 30g. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The portion looks about 1.5 tablespoons to 2 tablespoons, therefore the weight is approximately between 45g (small) and 60g (medium). Step 5: Cross-Validation - The portion is modest and in line with a light side serving. Therefore, a reasonable estimate is near the middle range, around 55 grams."

The target food item is ""oeuf"" (egg), which is visible on the plate as scrambled egg pieces in the bottom left corner. Step 1: VISUAL IDENTIFICATION - The scrambled egg appears to be from one egg, roughly spread out but compact. No partial eggs or multiple eggs visible. Step 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS - The scrambled egg covers a small portion of the plate. Compared to the other elements, it is roughly 7-8 cm long and 4-5 cm wide, with an estimated thickness of about 1-1.5 cm. Step 3: DENSITY CONSIDERATIONS - Cooked scrambled egg is dense and compact, with a typical density close to 1g/cm³. Step 4: PORTION SIZE CALIBRATION - A whole scrambled egg typically weighs about 50-60 grams. This portion looks like one full cooked egg, not a partial portion or multiple eggs. Step 5: CROSS-VALIDATION - No visible egg shell or waste; the entire cooked portion is on the plate. The size and volume correspond well to one medium Swiss-sized egg portion. Therefore, the estimated weight of the ""oeuf"" is approximately 55 grams."
wrah5h,tomates,48.0,65,17.0,0.08937568455640744,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/ee6e8045-59f2-4294-ae6a-1d5695abc176,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small portion of chopped tomatoes on a decorated plate, mixed with cucumber pieces. Visually, there are approximately 9 visible tomato pieces that are diced into medium-sized chunks. Each piece appears about 2-3 cm in size with an estimated thickness of around 1.5-2 cm due to their chunky cut. The tomatoes appear fresh and juicy, with their dense flesh including skin, adding to their weight. Comparing the size of tomato pieces to the cucumber chunks and plate pattern, the volume of tomatoes is moderate, not heaped or piled. Tomatoes generally have a density close to water (~1g/cm3), so their weight corresponds roughly to their volume. Assuming an average piece volume of about 6-8 cm3 each, multiplied by 9 pieces gives about 54-72 cm3. Since 1 cm3 roughly equals 1 gram for tomatoes, the weight range is 54-72 grams. Given that this is a moderate portion, I estimate the weight of the tomatoes to be about 65 grams."
wrah5h,pain,51.0,35,16.0,0.08937568455640744,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/c73a766e-70bf-435f-b53a-6b981cf634e3,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'pain' which corresponds to the slice of bread with Nutella spread visible on the plate. Step 1: VISUAL IDENTIFICATION - There is one single slice of bread fully visible, not mixed or layered with other foods aside from the Nutella spread on top, so the estimation is for one slice only. Step 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS - The slice of bread covers a large portion of the plate. By comparing it to the strawberries and raspberries and typical small plate size, the bread slice appears to be of standard Swiss bread slice thickness and size, approximately 10 cm in length and 7 cm in width, with a thickness around 1-1.2 cm. Step 3: DENSITY CONSIDERATIONS - Bread is generally airy but dense enough. Swiss bread slices tend to be smaller and thinner than typical US slices but dense due to whole grain or mixed ingredients. An average Swiss slice of whole grain bread weighs between 30-40 grams. The Nutella does not add to the bread weight as per instructions. Step 4: PORTION SIZE CALIBRATION - The slice appears of medium size and thickness, so I estimate the weight toward the middle of the range, around 35 grams. Step 5: CROSS-VALIDATION - This aligns well with standard Swiss slice sizes, and the visual and comparative analysis confirms the estimate is reasonable given the size of the slice relative to the plate and fruits nearby. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the pain (bread slice) to be approximately 35 grams."

The target food item is 'betterave' (beetroot). On the plate, the beetroot is cut into small cubes, occupying a portion of the plate by itself. I count roughly about 15-18 beetroot cubes visible. Considering the vegetable's density, which is relatively firm and dense, the cubes appear to be about 1.5-2 cm on each side, giving a decent volume. Compared to the other items and the plate size, the portion of beetroot is moderately sized but not very large. Given typical density of cooked beetroot is approximately 1.0 g/cm3, the total weight corresponds to about 70-90 grams. Generally, Swiss portions are smaller than US portions, so I lean to the medium side of this range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the beetroot on this plate to be approximately 80 grams."

The target food item is 'sauce oignons,' which is visible as a layer of cooked onions atop the slices of roast beef ('rôti'). Visually, the sauce onions cover most of the two slices of meat on the left side of the plate. The onions appear thinly sliced and cooked down, with a moist, somewhat translucent texture indicating a cooked onion sauce rather than raw onions. The volume of the sauce onions is moderate, approximately covering a surface area of about 8 cm by 5 cm, with a very shallow thickness of about 0.5 cm. Using the plate diameter of approximately 25 cm as reference, the portion is small. Cooked onions are relatively light but somewhat dense when cooked in sauce, so an estimated density of about 0.7 g/cm³ is appropriate. The approximate volume is 8 x 5 x 0.5 = 20 cm³, which at 0.7 g/cm³ corresponds to about 14 grams. Given the Swiss portion context where servings are modest and the sauce is spread thinly, a weight estimate around 12-16 grams is reasonable. Selecting a middle value, I estimate the weight of the 'sauce oignons' to be approximately 14 grams."

The target food item is 'fromage de brebis/chèvre (2 bouts)' which corresponds to the two small pieces of cheese on the plate with a white rind and a soft interior, positioned on the right side near the bottom. There are exactly two pieces visible. Each piece is small, roughly the size of a large grape or a walnut half, about 3 cm long and 2 cm wide, and about 1.5 cm thick. Considering the cheese density is soft, creamy, but still compact (typical for fresh sheep/goat cheese), each piece should weigh around 15 grams. For two pieces, the combined weight is about 30 grams. This aligns with Swiss portion context which tends to use smaller servings than in the US. The two pieces are neither thick nor large, and there's no hidden volume to add. Hence, the estimated total weight for the two pieces of 'fromage de brebis/chèvre' is approximately 30 grams."

The image shows a single peeled carrot placed on a granite countertop. The carrot is whole, with no visible cuts or missing pieces. Visually, the carrot is of medium thickness and typical length for an average carrot, approximately 15-18 cm long and about 3-4 cm in diameter with a tapering shape. Given that peeled carrots are denser than they appear and considering the average density and moisture content, a medium-sized peeled carrot usually weighs around 70 to 90 grams. Based on the visual cues and standard portion sizes typical in Switzerland, I estimate this peeled carrot to weigh approximately 80 grams."

The target food item is 'vinaigre,' which refers to vinegar. In the image, there is a bowl with various foods including chopped cucumber, tomato, grated carrot, pumpkin seeds (graines de courge), and a white cheese (sérac). The vinaigre is not visible as a separate food portion but appears to have been used as a dressing, visible as a light coating over the vegetables and seeds. Vinegar is a liquid condiment and typically used in very small amounts compared to solid foods, especially in a Swiss portion context where servings are modest. Given the visual evidence, the amount of vinaigre on the salad is minimal, likely less than a tablespoon. A typical tablespoon weighs roughly 15 grams, but vinaigre servings on salads are often smaller, about 5 to 10 grams. Here, the vinaigre distribution looks light and even, so estimating around 8 grams seems reasonable."
m4egh2,banane,77.0,65,12.0,0.10120481927710843,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/f218b781-84b2-41d2-b7fe-b01c9a162f8a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows one peeled banana that appears to be cut in half. The banana is about 10-12 cm in length based on typical banana size and surface texture comparison. Peeled bananas are dense with a typical weight of about 120-150 grams for a full medium banana, so about half would weigh approximately 60-75 grams. The banana piece shows no additional coverings or missing parts. Considering Swiss portion sizes which tend to be smaller than US, I estimate the weight closer to the lower-middle part of the range, about 65 grams."

The image shows a single piece of pain aux fruits held between two fingers. By comparing the food size to the fingers, the pain aux fruits appears to be roughly 6-7 cm long, 4-5 cm wide, and about 2-3 cm thick. This type of bread is typically dense with dried fruit inside, making it heavier than a normal bread slice of the same dimensions. Given the visible crust texture and density, along with presence of nuts and dried fruits, the density is moderately high. Based on these dimensions and density, a similar sized piece of fruit bread in Swiss portion sizes would weigh between 90 and 130 grams. Considering the size as a medium portion for such bread, a reasonable estimate would be about 110 grams."

The target food item is 'thon' (tuna). In the image, the tuna is mixed in with couscous, cucumber pieces, and pumpkin seeds within a glass container. The container provides a size reference: it appears to be a small to medium glass food storage container, roughly 15 cm by 15 cm by 7 cm deep. The tuna is shredded in small pieces throughout the mix and is visible in several clusters distributed evenly. Counting roughly, there are about 15-20 visible distinct tuna chunks, each about 1-2 cm in size, mixed in with the other ingredients. Since the tuna pieces are small and mixed, reasonable estimation requires assuming some amount is hidden or blended in the mix. The density of canned tuna is relatively dense and compact. Given the volume it occupies inside the container (roughly one quarter to one third of the total volume is tuna), and considering the glass container is about half full, I estimate the tuna portion to be around 80-100 grams. For a medium portion consistent with Swiss serves and based on this visual evidence, I estimate the weight of the 'thon' to be 90 grams."

The image shows a single lemon slice ('rondelle de citron') floating on top of a glass of water. The lemon slice is whole, round, and thin, with a visible rind and flesh. Comparing the lemon slice to the diameter of the glass, the slice appears to be about 6-7 cm in diameter and roughly 0.5-0.7 cm thick. Lemon slices are mostly water, with moderate density but are relatively light due to the thin cut. A typical thin lemon slice of this size weighs approximately 6-8 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes and a single slice, I estimate the weight of this lemon slice to be approximately 7 grams."

The target food item is the 'galette wraps.' In the image, there is one full galette wrap laid flat on a plate. It is whole and not folded or cut. Using the plate and fork as reference objects, the wrap appears to be a smaller Swiss-sized galette, typically less thick and smaller than American wraps. The thickness looks thin and uniform. Standard Swiss whole grain galette wraps usually weigh between 45 and 70 grams depending on size and density. This one appears medium-sized for Swiss portions, so I estimate the weight around the middle range of 55 grams. There is no visible folding or stacking that would add to depth or weight. Therefore, the estimation accounts only for the flat, single wrap without any toppings or spread."

Visual inspection reveals it to be a small, puff pastry item with visible layers and some tomato sauce baked into the pastry. The size of the feuilleté appears to be approximately 4 cm by 3 cm, with a thickness of about 2 cm. Comparing it to the grain of the wood and standard expectations for such pastries in Swiss portion sizes, it is relatively small. Puff pastry is light but the tomato sauce adds some moisture and weight, making it denser than plain pastry. Considering the density of puff pastry with sauce and the volume estimated, a typical portion of this size likely weighs between 25 and 35 grams. Given the small visible size and moderate density, I estimate the weight of one feuilleté sauce tomate to be around 30 grams."

The image shows a glass container filled with a mixed salad consisting mostly of couscous, cucumber pieces, chunks of tuna, and visible pumpkin seeds (graines de courge). For the target food item 'graines de courge', I carefully located the visible pumpkin seeds scattered throughout the mixture. Pumpkin seeds are small, flat, and dark in color, and several individual seeds are visible through the glass and on the surface. I estimate there are around 20-30 seeds visible, with some likely hidden within the mixture. Each pumpkin seed weighs approximately 0.7-1 gram given their typical density and size. Considering the volume, some seeds are not visible but present below the surface, and the seeds are lightly dispersed rather than densely packed. Estimating a total of about 25-35 seeds, and multiplying by an average of 0.8 grams per seed, results in a rough total weight range of 20-28 grams. Pumpkin seeds are dense and small, so even a small number adds up in weight. Given Swiss portion size is smaller than US, this quantity fits a medium portion for pumpkin seeds in a mixed dish. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the graines de courge in this container to be about 24 grams."

The image shows a single small slice of toasted bread (tartine) with visible spreads of both butter and chestnut cream (crème de marrons) on top. For a Swiss portion context, the slice is roughly 8-10 cm long and about 5-6 cm wide, with a thickness of toast around 1.5 cm, typical of a small serving. The bread slice likely weighs around 20-25 grams given its size and density as toasted bread. The butter and chestnut cream are spread thinly but cover most of the surface. Butter spread looks like roughly 5 grams, and chestnut cream, being denser but also spread thinly, around 10 grams. Adding these together, total weight of the tartine (bread + spreads) is around 35-40 grams. Since the target is the tartine itself (bread plus butter and chestnut cream) and the container (plate) weight is excluded, I estimate a total weight of 38 grams, a medium portion size for this item."

I carefully count one piece that has a typical thickness of a chocolate bar segment of roughly 7-8 mm, and a visible surface area roughly 4 cm by 2.5 cm. Considering the density of dark chocolate, which is quite dense and heavy for its volume, and the size of this piece being about a third to half of a standard rectangular square from a typical chocolate bar, the piece is likely around 8-12 grams. Given the 'Swiss portion context' tends to have smaller portion sizes, I estimate the weight conservatively near the middle of this range at about 10 grams."

The image shows a single artichaut (artichoke) on a plate. There is one whole artichoke present with no visible pieces missing. Comparing the artichoke to the hand holding the plate, we can estimate its size as medium, about 10-12 cm in length and somewhat rounded. The thickness and density of an artichoke are moderate, mostly composed of dense leaves and a fleshy heart inside. Swiss portions for an artichoke tend to be smaller than US portions. Typically, a medium artichoke weighs around 160-200 grams including the outer leaves, but since this is a cooked and trimmed artichoke without the stem visible, it is likely closer to 140-160 grams. Considering the size visible and density of the vegetable, a reasonable estimate is about 150 grams."

The image shows one single chocolate chip cookie placed directly on a wooden surface. The cookie appears to be of standard homemade size, approximately 7-8 cm in diameter based on typical floorboard width calculations. The visible thickness seems to be about 1 to 1.5 cm, consistent with a homemade chewy cookie. The density is medium to dense because it contains chocolate chunks and a typical cookie dough base, which are dense ingredients. Considering this is a Swiss context where portions tend to be on the smaller side, the cookie likely weighs less than a large American cookie but more than a tiny biscuit. A medium-sized cookie of this dimension usually weighs between 40 to 60 grams. Given the visible size, density, and thickness, I estimate the weight of this cookie to be approximately 50 grams."

The target food item is 'yaourt nature,' which is visible on the left side of the image as a small opened cup of plain yogurt. The cup size and shape closely resemble a standard Swiss yogurt pot, which typically contains about 125 grams of yogurt. Visually, the yogurt appears full and smooth, with no visible reduction in quantity. The yogurt container is placed next to an apple, which provides a size reference; the yogurt pot is smaller in diameter but taller than the apple, consistent with standard packaging. Given these observations and the common portion sizes for plain yogurt in Switzerland, I estimate the weight of the 'yaourt nature' to be 125 grams."

The image shows a bowl of porridge with various toppings. The target food is ""myrtilles"" (blueberries). In the image, I can count approximately 9 whole blueberries visible. Each blueberry, based on typical size and Swiss portion context, weighs about 1.5 to 2 grams. The blueberries appear fresh and plump, so I estimate towards the middle of the range at 1.8 grams each. Multiplying 9 berries by 1.8 grams gives approximately 16 grams. Considering some depth and slight hidden volume underneath, I will add a small margin to reach a reasonable estimate close to 18 grams. Therefore, the weight of the myrtilles is estimated at 18 grams."

The target food item is mayonnaise on one slice of brown bread. The bread slice is about the size of a hand palm, roughly 12 cm long and 7-8 cm wide. The mayonnaise is spread in a thin but visible layer, covering most of the slice surface. Mayonnaise is a light, creamy food with a typical density around 0.9 g/cm³. Given the bread slice size and typical spread thickness of about 2-3 mm, I estimate the mayonnaise volume as approximately 12 cm × 8 cm × 0.25 cm = 24 cm³. Multiplying by density (0.9 g/cm³) gives roughly 22 grams. Considering some unevenness and Swiss portion context which usually has moderate spread amounts, I estimate the mayonnaise weight to be about 20 grams."

Counting the pieces, there are about 20 small chunks, each about 1 cm in length and thin in diameter. Given their light density and small size, and considering Swiss portion sizes which tend to be smaller, this amount is likely a small garnish portion. Accounting for volume and density, the total weight of the green onion pieces is estimated in the range of 5-10 grams. I estimate a medium portion here of about 7 grams for the chopped oignon present on the plate."

The target food item to estimate is 'mayonnaise thomy'. In the image, the mayonnaise is visible as a single dollop on the plate, beside the white asparagus pieces. The mayonnaise portion is about the size of a standard spoonful, which corresponds roughly to a volume of around 15-20 ml. Considering the density of mayonnaise, which is about 0.9 g/ml, this translates to a weight range of approximately 13.5 to 18 grams. Given the typical Swiss portion size and the visual evidence showing a small but noticeable dollop, I estimate the weight of the mayonnaise thomy to be around 16 grams."

The image shows a glass bottle filled partially with shelled peanuts ('cacahuètes'). Step 1: Visually identify and count the peanuts. The bottle contains roughly 30-40 individual peanut halves, judging by filling up about one-third of the bottle's height. Step 2: Dimension analysis. The bottle seems to be a small milk or juice bottle (~250 ml capacity), and the peanuts fill about 1/3 of the bottle height, so volume occupied is approximately 80 ml. Each peanut half is small, dense, and compact. Step 3: Density considerations. Peanuts are dense nuts, usually about 0.6 g/ml. Using the volume and density, 80 ml x 0.6 g/ml = 48 grams. Step 4: Portion size calibration. The portion is moderate; not a large handful but enough to fill a third of the bottle. Step 5: Cross-validation. Considering some air gaps between peanuts, I slightly reduce the estimate by 10%. Final estimated weight is about 43 grams for the peanuts inside the bottle."

The image shows a single scoop of vanilla ice cream ('boule de glace vanille') partially covered with hot chocolate sauce. The scoop appears to be a classic round shape, about the size of a small ice cream scoop commonly used in Swiss portions, roughly 5-6 cm in diameter. Considering the density of ice cream, which is lighter than water but still moderately dense due to air incorporation, a standard single scoop in Swiss servings typically weighs between 50 to 70 grams. The scoop looks slightly melting but maintains a full shape, indicating it is a full portion, not reduced. Based on visual size and density, I estimate the weight of this single boule de glace vanille to be approximately 60 grams."

The target food item is ""oeuf"" (egg), which is visible in the image as a half of a hard-boiled egg. Step 1: Visual Identification - There is one half-egg visible on the plate. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The half-egg is about half the size of a typical medium hard-boiled egg, comparing with the rice grains and cherry tomatoes around it and the plate size. Step 3: Density Considerations - Hard-boiled egg is dense and compact, so half an egg weighs roughly half the typical weight of a medium hard-boiled egg. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - A medium boiled egg typically weighs about 50 grams whole (without shell). Half would weigh about 25 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The visible half matches this weight estimate well as it appears fully cooked with firm yolk and white. Therefore, the estimated weight of the ""oeuf"" portion in the image is approximately 25 grams."

Each slice appears approximately 7-8 cm long, 2-3 cm wide, and about 1-1.5 cm thick. Avocado is relatively dense and creamy, so the volume directly relates to weight. Considering the portion is smaller than typical US servings, and accounting for the thickness, I estimate the avocado weight to be around 30 to 40 grams in total, leaning to the middle of this range for a medium portion. Therefore, an estimated weight of about 35 grams for the avocado slices is reasonable."

The target food item is graines de chia (chia seeds), which are visible distributed throughout the bowl mixture. The bowl contains a creamy white base (likely blanc battu), with flocons d'avoine (oats) and some honey, but the seeds are identifiable by their small, black speckled appearance. The bowl is medium-sized and about half-full. The seeds are mixed in and appear to be a light scattering, not the bulk of the mass. Chia seeds are very dense but very small, so their visual volume corresponds to less weight than it might seem at first. Given the visible spread and usual portions of chia in such dishes, the total chia seeds present likely weigh between 10 to 15 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes tend to be moderate to small, I estimate the weight of the graines de chia at approximately 12 grams."

The target food item is 'vinaigre balsamique'. Step 1: Visually identify the vinaigre balsamique—the dark brown liquid dressing visible mainly on top. Step 2: Dimension-wise, the vinaigre balsamique appears as a thin layer lightly coating the salad surface, with some pooling on visible vegetable pieces but no deep accumulation. The bowl size and salad portion suggest a modest amount of dressing, likely under 20 ml. Step 3: Considering density, balsamic vinegar is liquid with a density close to water (~1 g/ml), so volume in ml approximates weight in grams. Step 4: In typical Swiss salad portions, vinaigre balsamique servings range from about 5 to 15 grams depending on drizzle thickness and bowl size. Step 5: Cross-validation confirms the amount is not large, as the vinegar layer is light and spread out, not saturating or pooling. Based on visual coverage and typical portion sizes for this size bowl, I estimate the weight of vinaigre balsamique to be approximately 10 grams."

The cookie's diameter seems to be about 7-8 cm judging by the granularity of the countertop tiles as a reference, and the thickness appears about 1-1.5 cm. Given that cookies are dense and fairly compact, a cookie of this size typically weighs between 40 to 60 grams in Swiss portion context, which tends to be smaller than US portions. Considering its somewhat larger diameter but moderate thickness, I estimate this cookie's weight to be around 50 grams."

The target food item to estimate is 'sauce curry avec mayonnaise'. In the image, there are two sandwiches on a plate, and the sauce appears as a yellow spread mostly inside the sandwiches. The visible amount of sauce is a thin layer spread on the inner sides of the baguette portions. The spread covers the length of the sandwiches but is not piled up heavily or in bulky amounts. Considering that the sauce is a mixture of curry sauce and mayonnaise, which are both dense, the weight for such a visible spread is roughly in the range of 10-20 grams per sandwich. Since there are two sandwiches, but the task specifies estimating one specified food item, we focus on one sandwich's sauce quantity. Taking into account the Swiss portion size, which tends to be smaller, and the thin distribution visible, I estimate the weight of the sauce curry avec mayonnaise in one sandwich to be around 15 grams."

The target food item is 'salade verte avec sauce,' which appears as a small pile of green leafy lettuce with some visible dressing or sauce on a white plate. Step 1: Visual Identification - The lettuce leaves are scattered and appear to form about 6-8 individual pieces of varying shapes and sizes. The sauce is lightly coating the leaves but thin enough not to significantly add weight. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The total volume is small, roughly equivalent to a handful of lettuce leaves. Each leaf is thin and lightweight, occupying a small surface area with minimal thickness, approximately 1-2 cm thick if piled. Step 3: Density Considerations - Lettuce is a very light food with low density due to its water content and leaf structure. The sauce contributes minimally to the weight as it seems lightly applied. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - This is a small portion, well below a typical small side salad which would be around 40-50 grams in Swiss context. Considering the sparse quantity and light coating of sauce, it likely weighs around 15-20 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - The size relative to the large white plate confirms the portion is very small, not overestimated, and the leafy nature means weight is low despite visible volume. Therefore, an estimated weight of 18 grams is reasonable for this quantity of green salad with sauce."

The image shows a small piece of bread (pain) with crème de marrons spread on top. Focusing only on the crème de marrons, it appears to be a thick spread covering the entire visible surface of the bread piece. The bread piece is somewhat small, about the size of a typical bite, estimated at around 8-10 cm in length and roughly 3-4 cm in width for the part covered with the spread. The thickness of the crème de marrons spread looks moderate, probably around 3-4 mm. Considering the density of the crème de marrons, which is a thick, dense chestnut spread, it is heavier per volume than lighter spreads like jams but not as heavy as a solid block. Calculating the volume roughly as length x width x thickness = approx 9 cm x 3.5 cm x 0.35 cm = about 11 cm³. Crème de marrons density is close to about 1.3 g/cm³ due to its sugar and chestnut content. Multiplying volume by density yields approximately 14.3 grams. Considering this is a small portion and could vary slightly, I estimate the weight of the crème de marrons spread on this bread piece to be around 14 grams."

It appears to be a medium-sized European croissant, with a typical thickness of about 3-4 cm. The croissant has a chocolate filling inside, visible by the bite taken, adding moderate density to the otherwise flaky pastry. Typically, such croissants in Switzerland weigh less than US portions, with a dense chocolate filling balancing the lightness of the pastry. Considering the added nuts on top and the typical weight of filled croissants in Switzerland, a medium portion is expected here.
