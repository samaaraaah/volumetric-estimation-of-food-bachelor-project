xjvrtk,tomates cerises,500.0,330.0,170.0,10.331834204448766,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/5ccbcf64-3631-48df-9e8a-85fb33dbf912,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a cardboard container filled with cherry tomatoes on the vine. There are about 18 to 20 cherry tomatoes visible. Each cherry tomato typically weighs between 15 to 20 grams, depending on size. The tomatoes shown are medium-sized, smooth, and appear fresh and firm. Given the number and average weight per tomato, the total weight can be estimated by multiplying. Using a range of 15-20 grams per tomato for approximately 19 tomatoes results in a weight range of about 285 to 380 grams. Taking the midpoint of this range, a reasonable estimate for the total weight of the cherry tomatoes is around 330 grams. The container size and the relative size of the tomatoes compared to the book page in the background support this estimate as plausible."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,250.0,167.0,8.464689437218913,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'salade de tomates,' which is clearly the dominant item on the plate. The plate holds several tomato wedges, roughly cut into quarters and halves from medium-sized tomatoes. The tomatoes are arranged loosely and have some balsamic vinegar, olive oil, flax seeds, and fresh basil leaves on top, which do not add significant bulk or weight to the tomatoes themselves. Considering the plate size relative to the cutlery, the tomato volume looks like about 2 medium-sized tomatoes worth, each medium tomato weighing roughly 120-150 grams when whole. Given the tomatoes are cut and spread, the total tomato weight is likely reduced slightly due to missing cores or trimming. A plausible total weight range for the visible tomato salad is around 220 to 280 grams, so the midpoint estimate is about 250 grams. This fits typical single-serving tomato salads in Swiss portions and matches the visual appearance without overestimating the volume or density."
wrah5h,pâtes,148.0,295.0,147.0,2.644463352376322,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/115dbd14-27ca-4200-a232-fa9f3eb9bad7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'pâtes' (pasta), which is located on the right side of the metal container. The pasta is spiral-shaped and covered with a visible amount of grated parmesan cheese. The portion fills roughly half of the container’s right side in both width and depth. Comparing the pasta size to the grilled chicken strips on the left and the green beans, the pasta volume is moderate. Cooked pasta is dense, so the volume visible likely corresponds to a reasonable weight. The container appears to be about the size of a typical meal prep dish (~20 cm x 12 cm), and the pasta depth looks about 2-3 cm. Estimating the volume of the pasta portion around 300-350 ml, and considering cooked pasta density is about 0.9 g/ml, the weight estimate falls between 270 and 320 grams. Choosing a midpoint value close to 295 grams as a plausible estimate that fits the visible amount and density. This is consistent with common portion sizes in Switzerland."
p8a2w5,pillons de poulet,112.0,250.0,138.0,1.8786921113407073,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/bdb25c53-2eb7-4a81-b33e-6d28997d0183,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows five chicken drumettes (pillons de poulet) placed on a plate. Each drumette is moderately sized with some charred skin, typical for cooked chicken wings. Considering a standard medium chicken drumette weighs between 40 and 60 grams depending on size and cooking method, these pieces appear average in size. Estimating closer to 50 grams per drumette, the total weight for five pieces would be approximately 250 grams. Taking into account some loss of moisture from cooking but accounting for the visual portion as fully present, a reasonable weight range is 220-270 grams. Therefore, the best estimate for the weight of the pillons de poulet is 250 grams."
2ahgvr,colrave crue,118.0,250.0,132.0,1.8932782302175764,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/3718d88c-ba98-4da1-84dc-7d5ad0a4df92,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows raw kohlrabi (colrave crue) cut into irregular chunks and placed on a white container lid. The pieces seem moderately thick and occupy almost the entire surface of the lid, which is roughly the size of a standard sandwich container lid, approximately 20 cm by 12 cm. Given the pieces appear to be about 1-2 cm thick on average, the total volume looks to be around 250-300 cubic centimeters. Kohlrabi is a dense vegetable with an approximate density close to that of water, about 0.9 grams per cubic centimeter. Using this volume and density, the weight range would be roughly 225 to 270 grams. Placing my estimate near the midpoint, I calculate about 250 grams. This estimate accounts for the shape, thickness, and density while visually comparing it to the container size and surroundings."

The viande (meat) is on the left bottom side of the plate. It appears as a cooked piece of ground or minced meat, roughly rectangular in shape, approximately the length of a standard steak cutlet portion but somewhat irregular. Comparing the size with the potatoes and lettuce leaves helps estimate volume. The meat piece seems moderately thick, around 1.5 to 2 cm, and about 10 cm long by 5-6 cm wide. Considering cooked ground meat density, which is roughly 250-280 grams per 100 cm³, and estimating a volume around 60-70 cm³ based on dimensions, the weight likely falls between 150 and 200 grams. Taking the midpoint and slightly adjusting for irregular shape and cooking losses, the estimated weight is approximately 175 grams."
wrah5h,riz complet,82.0,210.0,128.0,1.2757991977634617,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/ee492174-b956-48fe-a4cb-4f059c9bc233,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The 'riz complet' (brown rice) is clearly visible on the plate as a compact mound on the upper left side. It covers a sizeable area and has a typical cooked rice texture with individual grains visible but still slightly clumped together. The portion looks like a moderate serving, roughly 10 cm by 7 cm in surface area and about 2-3 cm thick. Cooked brown rice density is roughly 130 g per 100 ml. Estimating volume as approximately 150-180 ml based on its dimensions, this corresponds to about 195-230 grams. Given the appearance and considering Swiss portion sizes, a plausible weight range is 190-230 grams. Taking the midpoint, I estimate the 'riz complet' weight to be around 210 grams."

The courgette et oignons (zucchini and onions) are visible on the left side of the glass container. The vegetables are chopped and cooked, occupying about half the container's volume. The pieces are cut in medium-sized slices and mixed thoroughly. Considering the average density of cooked zucchini and onions, which is relatively low due to water content, the volume corresponds roughly to about 150-200 grams. Taking into account some water loss from cooking but also the compactness of the pieces, I estimate the weight of the courgette et oignons portion to be around 175 grams."
p96w4a,croissants au jambon,37.0,160.0,123.0,0.553178558405251,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/7bd6e67d-b1ca-42e4-a5ca-713b7fadda27,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two ham croissants ('croissants au jambon') on the plate. Each croissant is medium-sized, roughly about 8-10 cm long and appears fully intact. Taking into account the typical weight of a ham croissant (a puff pastry croissant with ham inside), which generally ranges between 70 and 90 grams per piece depending on size and filling, these look like standard portions. The croissants appear consistent with typical portions in Switzerland, neither unusually thick nor small. Considering the visible size and common density of this pastry and ham filling, I estimate each croissant to weigh around 80 grams. Since there are two croissants, the total weight would be about 160 grams. The plausible range would be roughly 140 to 180 grams, and the estimate is near the midpoint."
m4egh2,pain,84.0,195.0,111.0,1.1333414367327093,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/e8255768-2401-491d-9b2f-35168137da3b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows three slices of bread on a plate. The slices are of a rustic, crusty bread type that appears to be typical of Swiss bakery quality. Each slice is moderately thick, about 1.5-2 cm thick, and the size of each slice is approximately the length and width of a human palm, which suggests about 60-70 grams per slice. Given three slices visible here, but the target item is 'pain' (bread) in general, I estimate the total weight of all the visible slices combined. The slices have some slightly uneven edges, indicating possible partial consumption but mostly intact. Therefore, for each slice about 65 grams is a good average. The total weight estimation for all three slices together is approximately 195 grams. To be exact here, since the quantity and size are consistent for typical Swiss bread slices and considering the bread density and crumb structure, the weight should be close to this. Given the target is just 'pain' generically, the estimate is for the total visible bread slices, 195 grams is reasonable."

The target food is 'légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)' visible on the right side of the plate. The portion contains chopped carrots and leeks that appear cooked and slightly glossy, indicating some moisture and possible oil used in sautéing. The volume occupies roughly a third of the plate area. The vegetables form a loosely packed mound about 2-3 cm thick. Carrots and leeks have a moderate density, roughly 0.6-0.7 g/cm3 when cooked. Considering the size of the plate and comparing the vegetables to the rice and fish portions, the sautéed vegetables' volume seems about 120-150 ml, translating to about 75-105 grams. To stay precise and consistent with visual cues, I estimate the weight at around 90 grams."
8japfq,"pizza champignons, olives, courgettes",183.0,80.0,103.0,2.291114622584174,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/9ac9736b-e0d1-4862-9981-1f47f8109d18,"Let's work this out in a step-by-step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows four slices of pizza on a plate. The pizza is topped with mushrooms (champignons), black olives, and slices of courgettes (zucchini). The slices appear to be medium-sized with a standard thin-to-medium thickness crust. Typically, a whole medium pizza weighs around 300-400 grams. The four visible slices represent roughly two-thirds of a whole pizza, as there is a gap suggesting some slices are missing. By volume and visible toppings coverage, the mushrooms, olives, and courgettes seem evenly distributed with moderate density. The combined toppings and crust weight for these four slices is likely around 270-320 grams. Since we estimate approximately two thirds of the pizza is present, the total visible pizza weight is around 280 grams. Considering the toppings are light vegetables (mushrooms and courgettes) and moderate olives, the mushroom quantity on the pizza as a whole is moderate. Specifically for the mushrooms (champignons), which are visible on each slice as several medium sized pieces, they likely total about 70-90 grams across the visible slices, considering mushrooms absorb moisture and are lighter. Taking a midpoint estimate, the mushroom weight on the visible slices is about 80 grams. Thus, the estimated weight of the mushrooms (champignons) on the pizza slices shown is approximately 80 grams."

The 'salade de pâtes' is the portion of curly pasta mixed with small visible pieces of vegetables (like celery, corn, and tomato) at the bottom center of the plate. The pasta portion is relatively small, covering roughly 1/6th of the plate's surface area and is shallow in depth, likely around 1 to 1.5 cm thick. Cooked pasta is dense and moist, with an average cooked density around 1 g/cm³. Given the size of a standard dinner plate (about 25 cm in diameter) and comparing the pasta portion size to the plate, the pasta volume is approximately 150-180 ml. This translates roughly to 150-180 grams. Taking into account some air gaps between the pasta curls and vegetables, I estimate the weight to be slightly on the lower side of this range, around 160 grams. This estimate aligns well with the visible volume and typical serving sizes for pasta salad in Switzerland."

The galette millet maïs haricots noirs is located in the lower left part of the container, consisting of two small patties. Each galette is roughly 6-7 cm in diameter and about 1.5 cm thick. Considering the visible size relative to the container and the density of its ingredients—millet, corn, and black beans—these are moderately dense. Each galette patty likely weighs between 65 and 85 grams, given their size and density. With two patties present, the total weight is approximately 130-170 grams. Choosing a midpoint value, I estimate the galette millet maïs haricots noirs weighs about 150 grams."

The galettes millet haricots noirs maïs are visible on the right side of the glass container. There are five small patties arranged in a stack. Each galette appears dense with millet grains, black beans, and corn kernels, giving it a fairly compact texture. Each piece looks roughly 6 cm long, 3 cm wide, and about 1.5 cm thick. Considering millet and legumes are relatively dense when cooked, a single galette of this size likely weighs around 40-50 grams. With five galettes visible, the total weight range is about 200-250 grams. Choosing a midpoint, I estimate the total weight of the galettes to be approximately 225 grams."

The raviolis à la courge are located on the left side of the plate and appear as about seven pieces of stuffed pasta. Each ravioli is roughly 5-6 cm square and they are laid flat in a single layer. Considering cooked pasta density and the filling, each ravioli likely weighs between 25 and 35 grams. Seven raviolis at this estimated size and density would total between 175 and 245 grams. Given the moderate thickness and typical filling density (pumpkin squash), a midpoint estimate of about 210 grams is reasonable. This fits well with the size comparison to the cherry tomatoes and iceberg lettuce, both of which provide good volume references."

The poulet (chicken) is placed on the right center of the plate and appears to be a cooked chicken breast portion with some sauce. Visually, it covers an area approximately 12 cm long, 7-8 cm wide, and about 1.5-2 cm thick based on comparison with the fries and salad. Chicken breast is dense, with an estimated density of around 1 g/cm³. Therefore, estimating the volume roughly as a flattened oval, the volume is about 12 x 7.5 x 1.8 cm = 162 cm³, so the weight should be close to 160-170 grams. Considering some moisture loss by cooking and the presence of sauce, the estimated weight range is between 150 and 180 grams. This aligns well with a standard single portion of cooked chicken breast in Switzerland. Hence, a final estimate of 165 grams is appropriate."

The salade grecque is contained in a small rectangular plastic container that is about half to two-thirds full. The salad consists of small diced vegetables including cucumber, tomato, yellow pepper, some olives, onion rings, and small pieces of feta cheese, all coated lightly with a homemade dressing. Considering the container size, which is roughly similar to a standard lunchbox portion, and the volume occupied by the salad, the total edible portion seems to be about 250-300 ml in volume. Taking into account the moderate density of the salad ingredients (vegetables mixed with some cheese and a dressing), the estimated density is around 0.8 to 1 g/ml. Therefore, the estimated weight range is 200-300 grams. Choosing a midpoint near 250 grams fits well with the visual cues and the relative volume in the container without overestimating the dressing or the air gaps between diced pieces."

The spaghetti is the main component visible on the plate, forming a dense, slightly piled portion. The diameter of the black plate gives a size reference, approximately 20-23 cm across. The spaghetti roughly covers most of the plate but in a relatively thin layer, with some volume due to the strands being piled. Typical cooked spaghetti density is about 1 g/cm3. Visual estimation suggests the spaghetti mass could be equivalent to a moderate serving size seen in home cooking, likely between 130 grams and 180 grams. Considering the volume and density, and adjusting for some gaps between strands, I estimate the spaghetti weight to be around 155 grams."

The blueberries (myrtilles) are visible mixed within a bowl of cereal and yogurt. By visual inspection, there appear to be approximately 18 to 22 whole blueberries spread throughout the mixture. Each standard blueberry weighs about 1.5 to 2 grams. Considering they are fresh and whole, I estimate the total weight range to be around 27-44 grams. Given the distribution and volume in the bowl, the blueberries look to be on the upper-middle side of this range, so a midpoint estimate near 35 grams is reasonable and consistent with the visual volume and typical density of fresh blueberries."

The target food item 'pain bis' is the two slices of brown bread visible in the image. The bread slices are of medium thickness and have a typical rustic shape and size, roughly the length of a hand. Each slice looks around 1 to 1.5 cm thick with a porous interior. Brown bread (pain bis) has a density approximately around 0.3 to 0.4 g/cm³ considering its air pockets. Given the size and thickness, a typical slice of pain bis weighs about 40-50 grams. Since there are two slices, the total weight is roughly between 80 and 100 grams. Visual cues such as the hand for scale confirm this range. Choosing a midpoint estimate, the weight of the pain bis here is approximately 90 grams."

The image shows a small remaining portion of a pasta salad (salade de pâtes) on a white plate. The pasta pieces appear to be penne, cooked and mixed with visible corn kernels and some cherry tomato halves, as well as small bits of herbs and possibly chopped vegetables or ham. The scattered and small quantity remaining suggests this is not a full serving but leftovers. The approximate volume can be judged by counting the pasta pieces: about 15-20 penne tubes remain, scattered with some corn and tomato interspersed. A standard cooked penne piece weighs about 2-3 grams, plus the added vegetables and seasoning. The total pile appears to be around a small handful, roughly 50-70 grams. Considering the visible quantity on the plate and typical density of cooked pasta salad, I estimate the remaining portion weighs approximately 60 grams, with a plausible range between 50 and 70 grams."

The image shows one whole red apple ('pomme') placed on a flat surface. The apple appears typical in size, similar to a small to medium apple one might find in a Swiss market. The apple is not cut or peeled, so the full weight includes skin and flesh. Based on visual size comparison with the surface texture and typical apple dimensions, the apple seems to be on the smaller side, likely around 6-7 cm in diameter. Typical small apples in this size range weigh between 130 and 160 grams. Given this is a single medium-small apple with no visible size anomalies, I estimate its weight near the midpoint of that range at approximately 145 grams."

Visually, this apple looks compact and fresh, with a typical shape and no visible cuts or missing parts. The comparison with the croissant, which is of average size for a Swiss croissant (approximately 80-90 grams), further supports that the apple is slightly heavier. Given the standard density of apples and the visible volume, an estimated weight range of 150 to 190 grams seems plausible. Choosing a midpoint near 170 grams fits well within this range and the visual context provided by the croissant."

The target food is the vegetables composed of courgette, onion, and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. In the image, the vegetables appear sautéed and occupy roughly a third of the plate. The volume of vegetables is moderate, with visible sliced courgettes and onion rings. The courgette slices look medium thickness, while onion pieces are thinner but abundant. Sautéed vegetables have a density close to fresh, but slightly reduced due to water loss during cooking. A typical sautéed vegetable portion of this volume would weigh between 120-160 grams, considering the pieces are spread out and appear cooked but not wilted excessively. The olive oil contributes only about 13.5 grams but is integrated in cooking and does not add volume. Overall, the visible vegetable portion aligns best with a weight estimate near 140 grams, reasonably centered within the plausible range of 120-160 grams. This respects the portion size relative to the rice and egg and matches expectations for a side of sautéed zucchini and onions with oil."

The salami is visible on the right side of the plate in the form of small round slices, with a few pieces broken. Each slice is relatively thin but dense due to the meat and fat content. Given their diameter, which appears roughly 3-4 cm each, and considering the thickness, each slice could weigh about 8-10 grams. There are about 6-7 slices visible, but some are broken pieces adding less volume overall. This suggests a total weight range between 45 and 65 grams. I estimate the weight of the salami slices here to be about 55 grams, near the midpoint of this range, accounting accurately for volume and density relative to the other items on the plate."

The image shows a plate filled with chips made from vaya beans. The chips are relatively thin and crispy, with visible pieces of green and black spots indicating the vaya beans. Considering the size of the plate, which is a standard dinner plate about 25 cm in diameter, the chips cover a pile about 3-4 cm high in the middle. The volume is moderate, but the chips are light and airy, so although the pile looks substantial in volume, the density is low. Typical bean-based chips weigh approximately 0.9 to 1.1 grams per chip, and there appear to be around 20-25 chips in the pile. This suggests a total weight range between 18 and 28 grams. Choosing a midpoint weighted towards the middle, the estimate is around 23 grams for the entire portion visible."

The image shows a bowl containing a thick, creamy mixture which includes visible chia seeds and appears to have nut butter incorporated, consistent with the described 'séré maigre' mixed with 'graines de chia' and 'purée de noisettes.' The bowl appears to be about 12-15 cm in diameter. The mixture fills roughly three-quarters of the bowl in volume, suggesting around 150-200 ml volume. Considering that séré maigre (a type of low-fat curd cheese) has a density close to that of yogurt (~1 g/ml), and factoring in the added chia seeds and nut butter which are denser, the overall density could be slightly higher but close to 1 g/ml. Hence, the total weight of the séré maigre portion in this bowl is approximately between 160 and 210 grams. Choosing a value near the midpoint and slightly adjusting downward to account for air pockets and the texture shown, I estimate the séré maigre weigh about 185 grams."

The image shows a bowl containing a green leafy salad, sautéed mushrooms, three millet, black bean and corn patties, and a beetroot-lentil puree. The target item, 'galettes millet haricots noirs maïs', are the three patties placed in the bowl's right center. Each patty appears well-formed and quite thick, roughly 7 to 8 cm in diameter and about 1.5 to 2 cm thick. Given the density of cooked millet, beans, and corn, these patties are moderately dense. Estimating each patty weighs between 70 and 90 grams, three would total approximately 210 to 270 grams. Considering visible volume and density, a midpoint estimate of 240 grams for the three patties is reasonable and consistent with the portion sizes of the other foods visible in the bowl."

The image shows a blue plate with four food items: green beans cooked with oil (haricots verts + huile), red kidney beans (haricots rouges), cooked rotini pasta (pâtes), and a dollop of soft white mozzarella. The target food is the pasta. The cooked rotini pasta occupies roughly one-third of the plate's surface. The amount of pasta appears to be a medium portion, typical of a home meal serving. Considering the pasta pieces are well cooked and non-sticky, they have moderate density and moisture content. Compared to the kidney beans and the green beans in terms of portion volume and plate coverage, the pasta portion also appears larger than each of the other items. The pasta depth is about 1.5 to 2 cm, given the visible individual pieces and their layered stacking. Estimating volume by comparison to the plate size (approximate plate diameter around 25-27 cm), the pasta portion fits an estimated volume that corresponds to around 140-180 grams of cooked pasta. The midpoint of this range is about 160 grams. This is consistent with typical Swiss portions and aligns with the volume seen on the plate. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the cooked pasta to be approximately 160 grams."

The image shows a full small bowl of fresh blueberries (myrtilles), held in one hand. By judging from the size of the hand and the bowl, the bowl appears to hold about 1 to 1.5 cups of blueberries. Blueberries typically weigh around 148 grams per cup. Considering the bowl is quite full, I estimate the volume to be around 1.2 cups. This corresponds to an estimated weight range of 140 to 180 grams. Taking the midpoint but slightly favoring the visible fullness, I estimate the weight of the blueberries to be approximately 165 grams."

The image shows a stack of four Blevita crackers, which are typically known as crispbread type crackers from the brand Blevita. Each Blevita cracker usually weighs around 12-14 grams depending on the variety, and these appear to be a flavored or berry variant. Given the visible size, thickness and texture, and that four crackers are stacked, the total weight is approximately 50 grams (considering each cracker roughly 12-13 grams). The range could be about 48-52 grams considering slight size and density variations, so I choose a final value near the midpoint of 50 grams."

The poivron (red bell pepper) is located near the center-bottom of the plate, consisting of several sautéed or cooked strips. The visible quantity represents roughly 6 to 8 medium-sized strips of bell pepper. Considering the density of cooked bell peppers, which is less than raw but still significant due to moisture content, and comparing their size visually to the chicken pieces and avocado slices nearby, the total volume appears moderate but not piled thickly. A whole medium bell pepper typically weighs about 150-170g raw; cooking diminishes weight somewhat due to loss of water, but some pieces may be smaller. The cooked poivron portion shown likely corresponds to about half of a medium pepper. This suggests a plausible weight range from 60g to 85g. Choosing a value near the midpoint for accuracy, I estimate the poivron weight to be around 73 grams."

The salade de céleri (celery salad) is located on the bottom right section of the plate, appearing as a shredded, pale white portion. Visually, its volume is moderate and compact, roughly similar in size to the carrot salad on the top right, but slightly less dense looking. Considering the salad texture (shredded celery root, which is dense but not as dense as cooked potatoes), and the visible portion size of about a small handful, the weight is likely around 60-90 grams. Given the size and density relative to the whole plate with other foods, a midpoint of approximately 75 grams is a reasonable estimate, reflecting a smaller but dense salad portion."

The specified food item is 'tomates,' which visually appear as three medium-sized tomato slices laid out on the galette wrap. Each tomato slice is roughly 4-5 cm long and about 1 cm thick. Considering that tomatoes are mostly water with a density close to 1 g/cm³, and each slice seems about 15-20 grams, the total weight of the three slices would be around 45-60 grams. Given the visible size and typical water content, I estimate the tomatoes at approximately 52 grams as a midpoint in this range."

Each asparagus spear in a cooked state typically weighs about 12-15 grams depending on thickness and length. These spears are medium thickness and roughly about 12-15 cm long. Given the amount and visible density, the total weight for these seven asparagus spears should be roughly between 84 grams (7 x 12g) and 105 grams (7 x 15g). Considering some variability in thickness and moisture, a midpoint estimate around 95 grams is reasonable and consistent with typical Swiss portion sizes and the visible volume on the plate."

The bread slices appear to be average size, around 10 cm by 6 cm, and about 2 cm thick. Given the visible texture and density typical for crusty artisan bread, a single slice of this size usually weighs between 40 and 50 grams. Since both slices look similar in size and thickness, the estimated weight for one slice of 'pain' is about 45 grams. Considering slight variations in air pockets and crust thickness, a plausible weight range is 40 to 50 grams."

The scrambled eggs ('oeufs brouillés') are positioned on the left upper side of the plate and display a light fluffy texture with an uneven surface typical of cooked eggs. The portion size covers about one-third of the plate's visible surface area. Considering the plate diameter is likely around 24 cm (standard dinner plate), the eggs appear to occupy a volume roughly equivalent to a small bowl of eggs, but more spread out. Scrambled eggs are less dense than meat but denser than vegetables. A typical portion of scrambled eggs for one person usually weighs between 100 and 150 grams. Since this portion is moderately sized—not overly piled but covering a fair area—and since the eggs are well-cooked but not dense or compacted, a reasonable range would be approximately 110-140 grams. Choosing the midpoint gives around 125 grams. This respects the volume visible, texture softness, and corresponding portion sizes in Switzerland. Other plate items appear smaller in dense volume (e.g., gnocchi), supporting this estimate without overestimation."

The image shows a glass jar containing a mixture that includes graine de chia (chia seeds) visible as small black specks dispersed throughout the mixture. The total volume of the mixture fills about 80-90% of a small jar approximately 8-10 cm in height and 6-7 cm in diameter. The chia seeds are mixed evenly throughout with other ingredients like yogourt nature and oats, which are less dense, but chia seeds themselves are small and dense. Given that the chia seeds are dispersed, they likely make up around 10-15% of the total mixture by weight as chia seeds absorb liquid and swell but do not dominate the mass. The jar likely contains around 200 grams of mixture, considering the size and density of the ingredients. Thus, estimating about 20-30 grams of chia seeds fits visually and contextually. I thus estimate the graine de chia weight to be about 25 grams, with a plausible range of 20-30 grams."

The tomatoes are sliced and placed in the middle section of the container, occupying a moderate area with visible thickness. The slices appear to be roughly 4-5 pieces, each about average tomato slice size. Judging by the container size (standard small plastic meal prep container) and comparing tomato slices to the chunks of mozzarella and the millet portion, the total visible tomato volume corresponds to about half a medium tomato. A medium tomato generally weighs around 120-150 grams. Since only about half the tomato is present, I estimate the weight of these tomato slices to be between 60 and 75 grams. I choose a midpoint estimate of 68 grams to balance the visible volume and typical tomato density."

The image shows a small remaining piece of pizza on a standard-sized white plate. The slice is roughly 7 cm wide at the crust and about 8 cm long. The thickness of the pizza crust and toppings (including visible mushrooms and sauce) is about 1.5 cm on average. Considering pizza density (a mix of dough, tomato sauce, cheese, and mushrooms), the slice is moderately dense but not heavy. Given these dimensions, the volume of this piece is approximately 7 cm x 8 cm x 1.5 cm = 84 cubic centimeters. Given the density of pizza (roughly 0.8 to 1.0 g/cm³ depending on toppings), a plausible weight range is 65 to 85 grams. Selecting a value near the midpoint, I estimate this remaining pizza slice to weigh approximately 75 grams."

The fresh spinach (épinards frais) is clearly visible as a bed of large, fresh green leaves covering roughly half of the bowl's surface area. The bowl itself looks like a medium-sized square dish, approximately 18-20 cm wide. The spinach leaves are mostly whole and fresh, not chopped or cooked, which means their density is low to moderate. Considering the visible volume and leaf thinness, and comparing to other items like the tomatoes and falafels, the spinach weighs less than denser ingredients. A typical fresh spinach leaf portion of this size would weigh about 30-40 grams. Given some layering and gaps, I estimate the fresh spinach portion here to weigh about 35 grams."

The salade (salad) is located on the right side of the plate and consists of some mixed leafy greens and small chopped vegetables with dressing. It roughly covers a small circular area about 6-7 cm in diameter and has a low thickness, approximately 1-1.5 cm, giving a low volume. Considering the density of leafy greens and a small amount of dressing and vegetables, the salad is relatively light despite its visible volume. Given the portion is modest and compact, the estimated weight range for this salad is around 25-40 grams. The midpoint of this range is approximately 32 grams, which is a plausible estimate for this portion size considering the visible density and volume."

The ice cream scoop takes up a small to moderate portion of the bowl's base, and has a moderate thickness, roughly about 3-4 cm high at the thickest point. Hazelnut ice cream is fairly dense due to its creamy and nut-based composition, typically around 0.6 to 0.9 grams per cubic centimeter. Estimating the volume roughly as a small oval mound approximately 7 cm long, 3.5 cm wide, and 3.5 cm high, the volume is about 85-90 cubic centimeters. Multiplying by the density, the weight likely ranges from about 50 to 80 grams. Given the volume and density, a weight around the midpoint of 65 grams is reasonable. This estimate fits the visual size relative to the bowl and typical Swiss dessert portion sizes."

Assuming the bowl is about 10 cm in diameter and about 4 cm in height, and considering that the muesli is not densely packed but loosely clustered, a plausible volume estimation is about 150-200 ml. Muesli is fairly light since it contains mostly oats and grains with some air space, and its density can be roughly 0.4 to 0.5 g/ml. Multiplying volume by density gives a range roughly between 60 and 100 grams.

The tartine mélasse + beurre is the slice of bread on the bottom of the plate. It is a medium-sized slice of bread, roughly 12 cm long and about 5 cm wide at its widest point, with a moderate thickness typical of sliced rustic bread. The butter layer is thinly spread, not overly thick, while the molasses adds a glossy layer on top but without much additional volume. Considering the density of the bread (about 250-270 g per 1000 cm3) and the small amounts of butter (approximately 5 grams) and molasses (approximately 5 grams), the total estimated weight for this tartine should combine the bread slice of about 45-55 grams plus around 10 grams of toppings.

The density of chestnut cream is moderately dense, somewhat similar to a thick jam or puree, about 1.1 g/cm³. Estimating the surface area to be around 50-60 cm² and a spread thickness of about 0.4-0.5 cm, the volume is 20-30 cm³. Multiplying this volume by the density gives a weight range estimate roughly between 22 and 33 grams. Choosing a midpoint for the estimate, about 27 grams is reasonable."
p8a2w5,sauce bolognese,136.0,150.0,14.0,0.23143308617965236,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/abad1443-f704-4eb9-9657-7a67252ff801,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The sauce bolognese is visible as a thick layer on top of the pile of pasta. Judging by the plate size relative to the wooden table edge and the pasta strands, the serving of pasta is moderate and the sauce layer is spread generously but not too thick. The sauce covers a roughly oval area about 15 cm long and 8 cm wide, with an estimated average thickness of about 1 to 1.5 cm. Given that bolognese sauce has a medium density (similar to a thick tomato meat sauce), the volume is approximately 120-180 ml. Since 1 ml roughly corresponds to 1 gram for this type of sauce, the weight range is about 120 to 180 grams. Placing the estimate near the middle of this range, I assess the weight of the sauce bolognese on the plate to be about 150 grams. This is consistent with the visible quantity and common portion sizes for this dish in Switzerland."

The mozzarella is the white creamy portion placed atop the pasta (fusilli). It appears to be a fresh, soft variety such as ricotta or stracciatella-style mozzarella, which tends to be lighter and fluffier than a dense mozzarella ball. The portion size looks like roughly a heaped spoonful, about 6-7 cm long, 4 cm wide, and approximately 2.5 cm thick, taking into account volume and texture. Compared to the pasta portion, it occupies a moderate volume but has a lower density due to its light texture (about 0.6-0.8 g/cm³ for soft mozzarella types). Estimating volume around 50-60 cm³ and multiplying by density gives a range near 30-48 grams. To be conservative and realistic for Swiss portion standards and plating, I estimate the mozzarella at 40 grams, which lies near the midpoint of this range."
p8a2w5,tarte aux fraises,164.0,150.0,14.0,0.27908107451075725,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/7b64b358-b611-4155-8e79-6f3ce5b4f11a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a slice of strawberry tart (tarte aux fraises) on a plate. The tart consists of a pastry crust at the bottom, a cream filling, and several fresh strawberries on top, along with some red currants embedded in the cream. The slice appears to be a standard serving size, roughly equivalent to one-eighth of a full tart. The strawberries are medium-sized and sliced in halves, with about 6 halves visible. The pastry crust is thin but crumbly, and the cream portion looks moderately thick. Considering the density of the pastry, cream, and strawberries, the volume is moderate but not heavy due to the air in the cream and the lightness of the fruit. Typically, a slice of strawberry tart of this size can weigh between 130 and 170 grams. Near the midpoint of this range, 150 grams is a reasonable estimate. This accounts for the water content of the fruit, the cream's density, and the thin pastry base, matching the visual portion seen."

The waffle (gaufre) is rectangular and appears fully visible on a decorated plate. Its size seems comparable to a small dessert plate, roughly 10 cm by 7 cm, and about 1.5 cm thick. Considering this size and typical density of a cooked waffle, which is relatively light but compact due to cooked batter, a single waffle of this size usually weighs between 50 and 70 grams. The waffle surface is partially covered by apple compote, so no visible parts are missing to reduce the weight. After evaluating the volume and the density, the optimal estimate weight is around the midpoint of the plausible range, which is approximately 60 grams."

The hummous is located at the bottom left of the plate as a roughly 3-4 cm wide dollop with a thick, creamy texture. Comparing its size to the nearby olives and the brioches, it appears to be a moderate serving. Given its density and compactness, the hummous portion looks like about 2 tablespoons. Typically, 1 tablespoon of hummous weighs around 15 grams. This means the portion on the plate likely weighs between 25 and 35 grams. Taking the midpoint, an estimate of 30 grams is reasonable and consistent with the size and volume visible in the image."

The image shows a metallic container with what appears to be a wrap or galette bread, partially folded and partly consumed. The galette covers most of the container's length, which is approximately the size of a typical lunch box tray. The thickness of the bread is thin to medium, consistent with a standard flatbread or galette used for wraps. Considering that a typical galette or flatbread wrap weighs roughly between 60 and 90 grams depending on size and thickness, and given this one appears to be slightly large but folded, I estimate a weight range of about 70 to 85 grams. The wrap is not heavily dense since it is flatbread, so the weight is mostly from the bread itself. The midpoint of this range, around 78 grams, fits the visual volume and density observed while accounting for the partial folding and decent surface area coverage in the container."

The salade verte is the portion of green leafy lettuce at the bottom right of the plate. It covers a moderate area on the plate, with visible pieces of iceberg or similar lettuce type, lightly coated with dressing. The leaves appear relatively thin and low in density. Compared to other food portions on the plate, it is smaller in volume, roughly around a handful of leaves which is typical for a side green salad. Given the light dressing and the nature of lettuce (mostly water), a typical portion of this size would weigh between 25 and 40 grams. Choosing a value near the midpoint for accuracy, I estimate the weight at about 33 grams. This fits well with the overall visible portion size and the salad’s density."

The 'tomme fleurette' is located on the plate near the bottom right, identifiable as a small wedge of soft cheese with a slightly creamy interior and a thin rind. It is approximately the size of a typical cheese wedge about 4-5 cm long and 3 cm wide, with a small thickness of about 1.5 cm. Considering its volume and the known density of soft, creamy cheeses like tomme fleurette, which is around 0.9 g/cm3, the weight should be moderate. Visually, it looks to be a portion roughly 20-30 grams in weight. Comparing its size to the baguette slice and the other cheeses on the plate, I estimate a plausible weight range of 18-32 grams. A midpoint value of about 25 grams is reasonable and consistent with the visible size and cheese density."

The image shows a hand holding a partially unwrapped chocolate stick, referred to as 'branche de chocolat'. This item appears to be similar in size and shape to chocolate-coated wafer sticks commonly found in Swiss shops. Based on the width relative to the fingers and the length visible, the stick is likely around 10 cm long and approximately 2 cm wide, with a modest thickness of about 1 cm considering its irregular surface texture due to nuts or crispies. Such chocolate sticks typically weigh between 30 to 40 grams. Given that this stick appears intact and the standard densities of chocolate and inclusions, I estimate the weight at about 35 grams."

The image shows a rectangular plate with cooked pasta topped by two fried eggs and crisscrossed with ketchup. The eggs are large and cover a significant portion of the pasta. Typical large eggs weigh about 50 grams each when cooked as fried eggs (including some moisture loss, but with the whole egg intact). Given that there are two full fried eggs on the plate, the total weight for the eggs would logically fall between 90 and 110 grams, accounting for slight variability in size and cooking loss. The visual thickness and spread also align with this estimation. Therefore, I estimate the combined weight of the two fried eggs to be approximately 100 grams."

The image shows a single slice of rhubarb tart on a standard-sized white plate. The slice has a visible crust that is relatively thin and a filling primarily composed of rhubarb pieces embedded in a custard-like base. The rhubarb pieces are cut into small chunks, spread evenly over the slice. The slice thickness is typical for a tart, suggesting a moderate volume. Considering the density of cooked rhubarb, which is fairly light but somewhat fibrous, together with the custard and pastry, the weight should reflect this mixture. The knife and fork on the plate help indicate scale, confirming the slice size as approximately one-eighth of a standard tart. Typically, a whole rhubarb tart weighs around 800-1000 grams. Therefore, one slice like this would weigh approximately between 100 and 130 grams. Choosing a midpoint weighted towards the visible thickness and volume, I estimate this slice at about 115 grams."

The beurre (butter) is spread on four small slices of bread, each slice having a thin but visible layer of butter under the strawberry jam. Each slice appears to have approximately 3-4 grams of butter spread, given the thin coating covering most of the surface without thick clumps. Combining the four slices, the total butter weight is roughly 12-16 grams. This range accounts for some variation in spreading thickness and the visible surface area covered. Considering the thin spread and visible quantity, the final estimated weight of butter is 14 grams."

The image shows two slices of whole grain toast on a plate. The toast slices appear to be standard small to medium-sized slices, and the thickness looks typical for sliced bread. Each slice of toast is approximately 30-35 grams based on typical Swiss bread slice sizes. Since the request is to estimate the weight of the 'toast' (the bread only), and both slices are visible, the total weight of both combined is roughly 60-70 grams. Given no extra toppings other than a thin layer of fromage frais which is separate and not included here, the toast weight estimate will focus only on the bread itself. I estimate the weight of the toast in the image to be about 65 grams."

The image shows a plastic container with several chunks of pear (poire). The pear pieces are fairly large and together likely constitute about one medium-sized pear, cut into six pieces. A medium pear typically weighs around 150-180 grams in total. Considering that the pieces have some skin and are dense but juicy, the container seems to hold most of the fruit with little loss. The total volume and size of the pieces align well with a weight estimate in the range of 150 to 180 grams. Therefore, a midpoint estimate of 165 grams is reasonable for the weight of the pear pieces shown."

The volume appears roughly equivalent to a small handful, covering about a quarter of the bowl's surface area with some depth visible. Given the bowl's size relative to the spoon-sized falafel balls on the right, the sprouts likely weigh between 15 and 25 grams. Considering their low density but notable volume, an estimate near the midpoint at about 20 grams is reasonable and consistent with typical Swiss portion sizes for fresh sprouts."

The sauce vinaigrette in the image appears as a light dressing visible mostly on the tofu and some scattered on the vegetables, with some small drops on the surface. Since vinaigrette is a liquid and is lightly coated on the ingredients rather than pooled, the visible amount is relatively small. The container is a standard metal lunchbox, which helps contextualize the volume. Typically, a light application of vinaigrette on a meal this size would amount to between 15 and 30 grams. Here, considering the limited visible application and no large pools, a reasonable estimate is around 20 grams of vinaigrette dressing. This accounts for the thin coating and the typical portion size without overestimating."

The salad is composed mainly of shredded carrot, visible yellow corn kernels, and halved cherry tomatoes. The volume of the salad is moderate, occupying a circular area about 8-9 cm in diameter and around 1.5 cm thick on the plate. Given the density of shredded carrot (around 0.6 g/cm³), corn (about 0.72 g/cm³), and tomatoes (which are watery and lighter, about 0.5 g/cm³), and the visible quantity, the total mass is expected to be moderate. Considering the proportions of each visible ingredient and their mixture with a creamy dressing that adds a bit to mass and density, the salad portion can be reasonably estimated between 110 and 140 grams. A midpoint estimate near 125 grams fits the visible volume and typical density of this kind of mixed carrot-corn-tomato salad."

The slice is fairly thick and roughly standard size for a sandwich or breakfast slice, about 12 cm in width and 10 cm in height judging by comparison to the omelette pieces and the plate size. Typical slice weights for such rustic, dense bread in Switzerland are approximately 35 to 45 grams. Given the thickness and density visible here, the slice likely weighs near the midpoint of that range. The presence of the two omelette pieces helps give scale, confirming that this slice is not particularly thin or thick. Therefore, a reasonable weight range estimate is 35-45 grams, with a midpoint estimate around 40 grams."

The target food is the salade, composed of green lettuce leaves, carrot strips, and avocado pieces, dressed with olive oil and vinegar. The salad occupies roughly half the plate's surface, piled to a moderate thickness of about 2-3 cm. Using the eggs (fried), which typically are about 50 grams each, as a size reference, the salad's volume is clearly larger. Lettuce and carrots are low density vegetables, but avocado is denser and contributes weight. The visible avocado pieces are moderate in size, scattered within the salad, consistent with around 40 grams of avocado. Given the leafy nature, carrot strips, avocado chunks, and olive oil and vinegar dressing, an estimated weight range for the salad is about 150 to 190 grams. The midpoint near 170 grams accounts for the leafy bulk and denser avocado and dressing. This is plausible given the visual volume and density of components on a standard plate."

The biscuit pieces cover part of the ice cream scoop and have a thin, wafer-like appearance, suggesting low thickness and moderate density. Using the glass as a size reference, these biscuit shards likely originate from one or two small biscuits broken into fragments. A typical small biscuit weighs around 10-15 grams each, and since there are a few broken pieces amounting roughly to one biscuit size, the total biscuit weight should be estimated between 10 and 20 grams.

On the lower slice, the butter is underneath the nutella but visible in some lighter patches. The total surface covered by butter is approximately that of two average-sized slices of Swiss-style bread, each about 10 cm by 5 cm. A typical thin spread of butter on a slice of bread weighs about 5-7 grams. Given the amount of coverage and the light spread, it is likely around 5 grams per slice.

The image shows a single chocolate branch, identifiable as a solid, elongated chocolate bar with a textured surface. Its size compared to the wood grain of the table suggests it is about 10-12 cm long and around 2 cm in diameter. Chocolate density is relatively high, and such chocolate sticks typically weigh between 25 and 40 grams depending on size and thickness. Given the visible volume and the typical weight of similar chocolate branches, the weight is likely in the 30-35 gram range. The texture adds some small amount of volume but not significantly more mass. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this chocolate branch to be approximately 33 grams."

The image shows a single slice of bread (pain) on a plate. The bread piece looks like a typical slice from a small round loaf, with moderate thickness and some air holes typical of white bread. The slice is about the size of a small palm. A typical slice of similar bread in Switzerland weighs roughly 30-40 grams. Given the thickness and size visible here, but considering part of the slice is missing a small bite, I estimate the weight to be on the lower side of that range, roughly 32-35 grams. A midpoint estimate around 33 grams accounts well for the volume and density of this typical bread slice. This does not include the butter or the pâte à tartiner visible on the slice, which are separate food items."

The image shows two slices of bread on a standard-sized plate. Both slices appear to be from a rustic or country-style loaf, quite thick and with a somewhat dense crumb but still porous. They have spreads on them, but since we're estimating just the bread weight, we focus on the bread volume. Each slice is approximately 1.5 cm thick, about 12 cm long and 6-7 cm wide. Typically, this kind of bread slice weighs around 40-50 grams each. Both slices together would be roughly 80-100 grams. Since the prompt asks for 'pain' singular, I estimate the weight of one slice. Given the visible slice size and density, a good weight estimate for one slice of this bread is around 45 grams, with a plausible range of 40 to 50 grams."

The image shows a white bowl with a mixture that contains visible small black chia seeds scattered throughout a creamy base which appears to be white and thick, consistent with blanc battu and oats mixed with honey. The chia seeds are mixed uniformly and visible in medium quantity throughout the bowl's content. The bowl itself is medium-sized and the food fills roughly half of its depth. Given that chia seeds are small but dense, and the visible amount corresponds to a light but significant sprinkle rather than a thick layer or heavy serving, the quantity of chia seeds is estimated at around 10-15 grams. Considering the visual volume, density, and typical portion sizes, the weight of the chia seeds in the bowl is best estimated at 12 grams."

The egg (oeuf) is shown as half of a boiled egg on the plate. A whole hard-boiled egg typically weighs about 50 grams. Since only half of the egg is visible and appears intact, the weight of this half egg is approximately half of that, around 25 grams. The egg is firm, indicating no loss of moisture or volume, so this weight estimate is suitable and plausible given the visible portion and context of the other foods on the plate."

The avocado (avocat) is visible as two medium-sized slices placed on the wrap alongside shredded carrots and tomato slices. The slices appear fresh and reasonably thick. Given the plate size and the comparison with the other ingredients like the ham slice and grated cheese, the avocado slices correspond to about one quarter to one third of a typical avocado half. A medium avocado half weighs approximately 100-120 grams. The amount visible here is a fraction of that half, roughly one third. Thus, the weight of the avocado portion on the wrap is estimated in the range of 30-40 grams. Selecting a midpoint, the avocado weight is about 35 grams."

The mayonnaise is the white creamy portion on the left side of the plate. It appears to be a standard serving dollop, roughly 3 cm by 4 cm in surface area, with a height of about 2 cm. Mayonnaise is dense and thick, so this volume corresponds to roughly 20-30 grams. Considering the typical density of mayonnaise, and the size of this amount relative to other items on the plate, I estimate the mayonnaise portion weighs about 25 grams."

The salade (salad) is shown on the left side of the plate. It consists of leafy greens with some visible sunflower seeds sprinkled on top. The salad occupies about one third of the plate's visible surface, but due to the low density of leafy greens, the depth is shallow. Considering the size of the plate and the volume of loosely piled leaves, the salad portion likely weighs less than denser vegetables. A typical portion of leafy salad with seeds in this visual volume is roughly between 25 and 40 grams. Based on the visible volume and the light mass of the leaves, I estimate the salade weight to be around 32 grams."

The carottes (carrots) are visible in the bowl as thinly sliced pieces mixed with other vegetables. They are scattered among the pasta and aubergines and cover a modest surface area. The slices are thin, flat, and not piled very deeply. Considering the size of the bowl and proportions relative to the pasta and aubergines, the total volume of carrots appears moderate. Carrots have moderate density but due to the thin slicing their overall mass will be lighter than the equivalent volume of dense foods. I estimate the carrots weigh approximately between 30 to 50 grams. Choosing a value near the midpoint of this range, the estimated weight for the carrots is 40 grams."

The image shows a white bowl partly filled with two types of dry grains: on the right side, light beige oat flakes ('flocon d'avoines'), and on the left side, brown flax seeds. The oat flakes occupy roughly half of the bowl's inner surface, forming a relatively thin layer. Given the typical density of oat flakes, which is about 0.4 to 0.5 g/cm³ when loosely packed, and considering the surface covered and estimated thickness of about 0.5 to 1 cm, the volume can be roughly approximated. The bowl's visible diameter is around 15 cm (typical medium-sized bowl), so half the bottom is about 7.5 cm wide and the flakes cover an area around 40 cm². Multiplying area by thickness gives around 20-40 cm³ volume, and with density, weight would be approximately 8-20 grams. Given this, a reasonable weight range is 12-18 grams of oat flakes. A midpoint estimate of about 15 grams is appropriate and plausible."

The image shows two slices of bread on a white plate. One slice is spread with butter and molasses (mélasse), and the other slice is spread with butter and Nutella. Focusing on the slice with molasses, the molasses spread covers a surface roughly the size of the slice, but the layer is thin and slightly uneven. The bread slice appears to be a standard medium-sized rustic bread slice, roughly about 60-70 grams in weight by itself. Molasses is dense but is usually spread very thinly on bread, often about 5-10 grams per slice for a visible covering. Given the moderate coverage and thickness of the molasses layer, a plausible range is between 6 to 10 grams. Taking the midpoint and considering visual thinness, I estimate the molasses on this slice weighs approximately 8 grams."

The butter (beurre) is visible on the plate as a small rectangular block to the right of the piece of trout. It appears to be a single small pat of butter, about 3-4 cm long, 1-1.5 cm wide, and roughly 1 cm thick. Butter density is about 0.9 g/cm³. Estimating the volume visually as around 4–6 cm³, this gives a weight range of approximately 3.6 to 5.5 grams. Given the appearance and typical butter pat sizes served with cheese plates, I estimate the butter weight to be around 4.5 grams, within a plausible range of 3.5 to 5.5 grams."

The huile de lin (linseed oil) is likely not directly visible as a distinct liquid portion in the image, as it would be transparent and possibly absorbed into or mixed with the other foods. Since no separate container or visible oil puddle is apparent, the amount of linseed oil present is probably a small drizzle or dressing. Typical use of linseed oil for a meal like this would be around 5-10 grams (approximately 1 teaspoon to 2 teaspoons). Given the small quantities usually used for oils in balanced, mixed meals and the lack of visible pooling, I estimate about 7 grams as a reasonable midpoint in this range."

The image shows a portion of risotto with asparagus on a plate. The risotto is creamy and contains visible pieces of asparagus, indicating it's well mixed. Parmesan is typically grated or shaved on top or incorporated into the risotto, and is not a separate solid piece visible in the image. Given the consistency and color, the parmesan is likely well integrated and represents a topping or ingredient adding to the texture and flavor. A common parmesan garnish or inclusion for this portion size (about 150-180 grams of risotto) would be around 10-20 grams of parmesan. Considering the typical portion size in a Swiss home-cooked meal and the visual prominence of the dish, I estimate the parmesan weight to be about 15 grams, within a plausible range of 10-20 grams."

The image shows one slice of tresse bread with a thin layer of butter spread over it. The slice is about the size of a typical slice of braided Swiss bread, roughly 12 cm by 7 cm and about 1.5 cm thick. Given the thin spread of butter roughly covering the slice's surface, the amount of butter looks to be around 3-5 grams, as a thin layer of butter typically weighs around 4 grams per tablespoon and this is visually less than a tablespoon. Considering the butter layer is quite even but not very thick, a reasonable weight estimate is near the midpoint of this range, about 4 grams."

The image shows a single piece of rustic bread ('pain') topped with caviar d'aubergines. The bread slice appears to be about 10 cm long and 5 cm wide, with a thickness of roughly 2 cm. This suggests a relatively dense, airy bread with a firm crust. Considering the size and typical density of this type of bread, a piece like this would weigh approximately between 40 and 60 grams. Given the visible volume and the typical weight per cubic centimeter of rustic bread, I estimate the weight of the bread slice at around 50 grams, which lies near the middle of the plausible range."

The image shows a small piece of a demi croissant with some butter and apricot jam spread on top. The piece is less than half of a standard demi croissant, roughly about a quarter of a demi croissant based on visible size and thickness. A typical demi croissant weighs about 40-45 grams in Switzerland. Since this portion is about a quarter of a demi croissant, the weight should be around 10-12 grams. The butter and apricot jam add a small additional weight, approximately 2-3 grams combined. Taking all this into account, a plausible weight range is 11-15 grams, with an estimate near the midpoint at 13 grams."

The image shows a plate divided into three portions: boulgour, ratatouille, and a hard-boiled egg (œuf dur) cut in half. The two halves of the egg are standard size, with firm white and yolk visible. A whole large chicken egg typically weighs about 50 grams, with the edible part (white and yolk) weighing close to that. Here, the egg appears fully cooked and intact, with no missing parts. The halves together represent one full egg, so the weight estimate should be based on a typical large egg. Considering the density of cooked egg, the weight of the two halves combined is approximately 50 grams. The visible size compared to the cutlery and plate size confirms this standard portion. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the œuf dur to be 50 grams."
