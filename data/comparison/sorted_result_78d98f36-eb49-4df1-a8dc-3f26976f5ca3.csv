The courgette et oignons are located on the left side of the glass container. The portion consists of sliced zucchini (courgette) and onions, cooked and slightly softened. The volume they occupy is roughly half of the container's base and is about 1.5 to 2 cm high, which corresponds to a moderate portion size. Considering the water content and density of cooked zucchini and onions, the density is relatively low, but the volume is still substantial given the container size (about 13 cm square). I estimate the total weight of courgette et oignons to be between 100 and 130 grams. Taking the midpoint for accuracy, the best estimate is around 115 grams."
xjvrtk,tomates cerises,500.0,330.0,170.0,10.310528869480834,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/5ccbcf64-3631-48df-9e8a-85fb33dbf912,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a container with a bunch of cherry tomatoes ('tomates cerises'), some still attached to the vine. There are about 19 to 20 tomatoes, of varying ripeness (some red, some orange). Cherry tomatoes typically weigh around 15-20 grams each, given their size and density. The tomatoes here are fairly uniform and medium-sized. Considering this, an estimated total weight range for the entire batch is roughly 280-380 grams. Taking the midpoint and considering the variability, I estimate the total weight of the cherry tomatoes at 330 grams."

The specified food item is 'salade de tomates,' which is clearly visible on the plate. The tomato salad consists mainly of sliced tomatoes, arranged to cover the entire plate surface. The plate appears to be a standard dinner plate of about 25-27 cm diameter, providing a good size reference. The tomatoes are cut into wedges and rounds, scattered with some green leaves and sprinkled with flax seeds on top, with visible balsamic vinegar and olive oil, but these liquid components are minimal in weight compared to tomatoes. Tomatoes are mostly water and have medium density, about 0.95g/cm³. Considering the thickness and number of tomato slices covering the plate, this portion visually corresponds to about 2 medium-sized tomatoes. A medium tomato weighs approximately 120-150 grams. Two of these would weigh roughly 240-300 grams. Given the plate is fully covered but not heaped, and factoring some spaces between slices, a reasonable weight range is 230 to 280 grams. Final estimate near the midpoint is about 255 grams."
2ahgvr,salade grecque,315.0,175.0,140.0,5.349344978165939,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/c476a6d0-acb2-45fd-b168-84822bc98003,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a rectangular plastic container partially filled with a Greek salad ('salade grecque'). Inside, there are visible diced vegetables like cucumber, yellow and red bell peppers, tomatoes, olives, some onion rings, and small pieces of feta cheese. The container is about the size of a typical medium lunch box, likely around 12 cm by 8 cm by 6-7 cm deep. The salad fills just under half of the container's volume, appearing loosely packed. Considering the water content and density of vegetables and feta, a moderate estimate would be around 150-200 grams for the visible portion. I choose a weight near the midpoint, about 175 grams, as the final estimate for the Greek salad portion in the container."

The 'pillons de poulet' (chicken drumettes) are located on the left side of the plate. There are five pieces, each reasonably sized with some visible charring and cooked skin, indicating they are cooked and ready to eat. Considering that a typical chicken drumette weighs between 40 and 60 grams, and these appear to be average-sized pieces, the total weight should be roughly between 200 and 300 grams for all five. Given the visual fullness and size compared to the bread slices and the salad, I estimate that these chicken drumettes weigh approximately 250 grams in total."
xjvrtk,myrtilles,200.0,70.0,130.0,3.153808830664726,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/4d153e2f-e2dc-478b-80de-472793d5b51e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The food item to estimate is 'myrtilles', or blueberries, which are visibly filling a small bowl held in one hand. The blueberries appear fresh, round, and of typical size with some variation, approximately 1.5 to 2 cm in diameter each. The bowl is small, approximately palm-sized, and quite full with the blueberries slightly heaped above the rim. A typical average blueberry weighs around 1 to 1.5 grams each. Judging by the visible volume, there are roughly 50 to 60 blueberries in the bowl. Estimating the total weight considering the fullness, density, and the average weight per berry leads to a plausible range of 50 to 90 grams. The middle of this range, around 70 grams, fits well with the observed volume and typical density of blueberries. Therefore, 70 grams is a reasonable and precise estimate for the weight of the blueberries in the bowl."
xjvrtk,galettes millet haricots noirs maïs,155.0,270.0,115.0,2.1621785540999516,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The galettes millet haricots noirs maïs are visible on the right side of the glass container. There are six small round patties lined up closely together. Each galette appears dense, containing grains of millet, black beans, and pieces of corn. Given their size—approximately 6-7 cm in diameter and around 1.5 cm thick—the individual weight of each galette can be estimated. Considering cooked millet and beans have moderate density and some moisture content, each galette likely weighs about 40-50 grams. Multiplying by six galettes gives a plausible total range of 240-300 grams. Estimating near the midpoint, a value of 270 grams seems reasonable. This aligns well with the visible volume, relative to the courgettes and onions on the left, which are less dense and occupy a similar area."

The image shows a rectangular metal container with several food items separated into three visible sections. The target food is 'pâtes' (pasta), located on the right side of the container. The pasta portion appears to be curly pasta (fusilli) cooked and mixed with a tomato-based sauce, topped with a noticeable layer of grated parmesan. The quantity of pasta fills roughly one-third of the container's length and covers a surface about half the container's width. The container appears to be a standard medium-sized lunch box around 20 cm long and 13 cm wide. Given the visible amount of pasta and sauce, the volume likely corresponds to about 220-280 grams of cooked pasta with sauce. Accounting for density and sauce absorption, a reasonable estimate of the pasta weight is around 250 grams. The parmesan is not included since it is a separate item. This estimate aligns with the visible fullness and container size."
p8a2w5,viande,44.0,140.0,96.0,0.512372634643377,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/9db1412f-0390-4151-9d81-2b27a4f9a0d9,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The 'viande' (meat) is visible on the lower left side of the plate. It appears to be a cooked ground beef patty, approximately the size of a hand palm, around 10-12 cm in length and about 2 cm thick. Considering the typical density of cooked ground beef, which is about 250-300 grams per 100 cm3, and estimating the volume based on the visible size, the patty likely weighs between 120 and 160 grams. The patty is not very thick but has some irregular edges and charred spots. Compared to the potatoes and salad on the plate, the volume seems consistent with a meat portion around 140 grams. I choose a midpoint estimate of 140 grams as a reasonable weight for this piece of meat."
wrah5h,"légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)",198.0,110.0,88.0,2.11353711790393,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/5e117510-fc82-4a06-a502-12983d55aac5,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item 'légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)' is clearly visible on the right side of the plate. The portion consists mostly of sliced carrots and chopped leeks sautéed together, with a slight gloss indicating some oil or cooking moisture. The volume takes about one quarter of the plate. Considering that sautéed vegetables lose some water but maintain volume and have a medium density (less dense than rice or fish), a similar volume of sautéed carrots and leeks usually weighs around 90-130 grams. Given the portion size here, which looks moderately generous but not heaped, I estimate the weight is near the midpoint, about 110 grams. This aligns with the visual fullness and typical sautéed vegetable portions served in Switzerland."
wrah5h,tomates,28.0,115.0,87.0,0.2954876273653566,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/19a2e7b0-7aad-44c5-b52a-d67294d4ef49,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The tomates (tomato) are shown as about three medium-sized tomato wedges placed on the top right of the wrap. These tomato pieces are fresh, with visible juice and seeds. Each wedge looks roughly like a quarter of a medium tomato. A whole medium tomato typically weighs about 150 grams. Since these are about three quarters of a tomato in total, the visible tomato portion should weigh close to 110-120 grams. Considering the volume and density of fresh tomato wedges and the visible amount here, a plausible weight range would be 100-130 grams. Choosing a midpoint within this range, I estimate approximately 115 grams for the tomatoes in this wrap."

The image shows a slice of tarte aux fraises (strawberry tart) on a standard-sized dessert plate. The slice is topped with around 7 halved strawberries, with some cream and a few small red currants embedded in a thick cream layer above a flaky crust. The crust appears thin but crisp, and the cream layer is moderately thick but not overly dense. The strawberries are fresh and dense, and the size of the slice suggests about one-eighth of a typical 20-22 cm tart. Considering a typical full strawberry tart weighs roughly 600-700 grams, one slice would reasonably be around 75-90 grams. Considering the visible volume of cream and fruit, and the crust, I estimate this slice of tarte aux fraises to weigh approximately 80 grams."

The image shows a blue plate with three main foods: grilled salmon (saumon grillé), brown rice (riz complet), and a carrot and corn salad (salade carotte et maïs). The brown rice portion is on the left side of the plate. The rice appears cooked, loose but slightly compacted in a mound about the size of a fist. Considering the density of cooked brown rice, which is roughly 130 grams per cup (approximately 240 ml), the portion looks to be around 3/4 cup to 1 cup in volume. That suggests a weight in the range of about 150 to 180 grams. Given the fullness and spread of the rice mound, a safe middle estimate is about 165 grams. This estimate aligns well with typical portion sizes for cooked brown rice servings and visually fits the plate size and other food portions shown."
r3bub9,tomate,50.0,125.0,75.0,0.45487627365356625,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/r3bub9/dish_media/bb18e23e-6449-46ba-a82b-2f630af251aa,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The tomates are sliced and occupy roughly a third of the container, placed in the middle portion between the mozzarella and millet. Given the container is a small to medium-sized food storage box, approximately 15 cm by 10 cm, the tomato slices are moderately thick and spread out in a single layer. Tomatoes have a high water content and relatively low density, around 0.9 g/cm³. Estimating the total volume occupied by the tomato slices to be about 120-160 cm³, the weight should be in the 108-144 grams range. Given some gaps between slices and slight air space, I estimate the tomato weight around the midpoint, about 125 grams. This estimate is also consistent with the portion size relative to the other foods visible."
p8a2w5,sauce bolognese,136.0,63.0,73.0,1.2042697719553614,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/abad1443-f704-4eb9-9657-7a67252ff801,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The sauce bolognese is visible as a thick layer on top of the spaghetti, covering roughly a central rectangular area approximately 10 cm long by 5 cm wide. The sauce appears dense and chunky but relatively compact, indicating a typical meat and tomato sauce consistency. Given the thickness is approximately 1 - 1.5 cm, the volume is roughly 50-75 cm³. Meat sauces typically weigh around 1 g per cm³ due to their density (similar to water but slightly higher due to meat and tomato solids). Hence, the weight should be about 50-75 grams. To ensure accuracy, the sauce does not overflow or cover the pasta extensively, which supports a moderate portion size. I estimate the sauce bolognese weight as approximately the midpoint, 63 grams."

The image shows a small green bowl containing three large strawberries. Each strawberry is roughly comparable in size to a large medium strawberry, with an average weight of about 20-30 grams depending on size. These strawberries appear dense and fresh. Given their size and the number of strawberries, the total weight likely falls between 65 to 90 grams. The strawberries are quite plump and visible fully in the bowl, which supports this range. The midpoint is about 77 grams, which seems a reasonable and precise estimate."

The specified food item is 'carotte,' which is clearly visible on the left side of the plate as sliced cooked carrot rounds. They have an average thickness of about 1.5 to 2 cm each and there are around 16 visible pieces, some cut thicker and some thinner. Given that cooked carrot slices are fairly dense but also contain significant water content, typical density approximates around 0.7 to 0.8 g/cm3. Considering the volume of these pieces on the plate and visually comparing to the size of the plate and the quinoa bulgur portion on the right, the total weight of the carrot slices is probably in the range of 100 to 130 grams. The carrot pieces are not heaped, but neatly arranged in a loose cluster, so estimating around the midpoint of this range at about 115 grams seems reasonable. This aligns with the visible portion size and typical carrot slice weight."

The spaghetti is served on a medium-sized black plate placed on a kitchen scale. The portion occupies a large part of the plate, with spaghetti strands piled in a loose mound. The spaghetti appears cooked, and based on the volume and typical density of cooked spaghetti (about 1.3 g/cm³), the serving looks moderately dense but not overpacked. Comparing it to the size of the plate (roughly 22-24 cm diameter) and the volume of the mound, I estimate the spaghetti portion to weigh between 130 and 170 grams. The midpoint, about 150 grams, seems reasonable and consistent with the appearance and portion size relative to typical single servings in Switzerland."

The target food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries), which are visible mixed in with the yogurt and cereal in the bowl. The bowl is medium-sized, typical for breakfast. The blueberries are scattered throughout the mixture, appearing whole and roughly uniform in size, about 1.5-2 cm each. Given their spread and quantity in the bowl, they occupy a moderate volume but are relatively light due to their water content. Judging by the visible surface and approximate distribution, there are roughly 20-25 blueberries spread in the mixture. A typical blueberry weighs about 1-1.3 grams. Considering partial submersion in yogurt and some potentially hidden under cereals, the total weight is plausibly in the range 25-35 grams. The mid-value of around 30 grams best fits the visual quantity and expected density."

The image shows a single medium-sized red apple (pomme) placed on a flat surface. The apple appears to be typical in size, about the size of a fist, with a smooth red skin and a visible stem. Given the average density of apples, which is mostly water, and their usual size, this apple likely weighs between 140 and 180 grams. Considering the visual fullness and size, I estimate the apple's weight to be around 160 grams, which lies near the midpoint of the plausible range."

The tiramisu is the dessert piece on the left side of the plate. It is a typical rectangular slice with visible layers of creamy mascarpone and soaked sponge cake. Based on the plate size and the visible thickness of the tiramisu, the portion appears to be moderately sized. Tiramisu is relatively dense because of the mascarpone cream and soaked sponge, but also aerated somewhat. The size looks roughly equivalent to a moderate individual dessert portion. An average restaurant serving of tiramisu weighs around 120-150 grams. Given the visible volume and moist density, I estimate the tiramisu here to be approximately 135 grams, comfortably between 120 and 150 grams. This estimate is reasonable considering the plate size and the appearance of the slice."

The image shows a white plate with a small remaining portion of pasta salad. The visible pasta shapes are penne, and the salad contains visible corn kernels, small pieces of tomato, herbs, and possibly small bits of other vegetables or meat. Considering the pasta pieces' size and quantity, they appear to weigh roughly around 40-60 grams. The additional vegetables and other ingredients add some volume and weight but not a large amount. Given that the portion is well less than a full serving and is scattered mostly in the center of the plate, an estimate at the midpoint of this range seems reasonable. Therefore, the estimated weight of the pasta salad on the plate is about 50 grams."

The 'légumes (courgette, oignon, 1 cs d'huile d'olive)' are located on the left half of the plate. The visible vegetables are mainly sliced courgette and onion, cooked and slightly sautéed, which reduces volume compared to raw weight. The portion covers a moderate area of the plate, approximately one third of the dish surface. Given the typical density of cooked courgette and onion, and the sautéing with about 1 tablespoon (cs) of olive oil which adds minimal weight but affects volume, the vegetable mix likely weighs more than the dry volume implies but less than a dense starchy vegetable. In Swiss servings, such a cooked vegetable portion usually ranges between 100g to 140g. The amount here is moderately generous but not large, so a midpoint estimate of 120 grams is appropriate."

The image shows a plastic container with several cut pieces of pear ('poire'). The pieces include varying sizes, with some larger wedge-shaped sections and smaller chunks. The container itself is a standard small lunchbox size, and the pear pieces fill about half of it in volume. A medium pear with skin generally weighs between 150 and 200 grams. Since the container holds roughly half to two-thirds of a full pear cut into pieces, the total weight of the pear pieces appears to be around 100 to 130 grams. Considering the density and visible portion sizes, the weight estimate near the midpoint is approximately 115 grams."

Using the croissant as a size reference (typical croissants are about 50-70 grams) and comparing it to the apple, the apple is slightly smaller in volume but denser. A small to medium apple usually weighs between 140-170 grams. Given the apple's visible size, shape, and typical density, a plausible weight range would be around 140 to 170 grams. Choosing a midpoint weight, I estimate the apple weighs approximately 155 grams. This estimate matches the visible size and known density of similar apples."

The slices appear to be typical sandwich bread size, slightly dense and thick with visible air holes. A medium slice of whole grain bread typically weighs between 40 to 50 grams. Given that these slices are of average thickness and size, and not particularly thin or thick, the weight of one slice can be reasonably estimated around 45 grams. Since the food list and question ask for 'pain bis' (plural), and two slices are shown, the total weight of both slices would be approximately 90 grams. This accounts for both slices only, excluding toppings. The visible context, including hand size and sandwich layering, supports this weight range."

Flatbreads or wraps like this typically weigh between 40 and 60 grams when whole, depending on thickness and size. Judging by the visible length, width, and thickness, this looks like an average-sized wrap. Since it is partially eaten, approximately three-quarters of the wrap remains. If a full wrap weighs roughly 50 grams, then three-quarters would weigh about 37-38 grams. Considering the compactness and texture of the galette (thin and pliable), the wrap's weight estimate aligns with this calculation. Therefore, a reasonable weight estimate for the remaining pain/galette visible in the image is approximately 38 grams."

The 'poulet' (chicken) portion is clearly visible on the bottom right part of the plate. It appears to be a single cooked chicken breast, with some sauce around it. Comparing it to the size of the fries on the left and the green salad on the top right, the chicken breast looks like a medium-sized portion. A typical cooked chicken breast of this size usually weighs between 130 and 170 grams. Considering the thickness, size relative to the plate, and visible volume, I estimate the weight of the chicken breast to be around 150 grams. This fits well with the visible size and context of the meal."

The image shows two slices of bread on a plate. The slices appear to be of standard handmade or rustic bread, each roughly 13-15 cm long and about 6-7 cm wide, with moderate thickness of about 1.5-2 cm. Given the visible texture and density of this type of bread, and comparing it to standard slice weights from similar bread types in Switzerland, each slice roughly weighs between 40 and 55 grams. Since the target food is 'pain' (bread), and considering there are two slices present, the total weight of the bread visible is in the 80 to 110 grams range. Choosing a midpoint near 95 grams accounts for some variability in thickness and density visible here. This estimate neglects the spread on the bread (beurre, mélasse, nutella) as they are separate items."

The salade de pâtes is located at the bottom left quadrant of the plate, consisting of short spiral pasta with visible pieces of vegetables like corn, tomato, and cucumber. The portion occupies a modest area on a standard-sized dinner plate (approximately 24-26 cm in diameter). Given the compact and dense nature of cooked pasta salad, the volume suggests about a medium-sized side portion. Typically, a portion of pasta salad that fits this visible volume weighs between 100 and 130 grams. Considering the presence of vegetables mixed with pasta, which adds some volume but lowers the density slightly, a reasonable estimate near the midpoint is around 115 grams. This fits well with the visual fullness of the portion compared to the other items on the plate, such as the carrot salad and meats."

The galettes millet haricots noirs maïs are located on the right half of the bowl, distinguished as three dense, compact patties with visible corn and black beans. These patties occupy a significant portion of the bowl, which is about the size of a typical small dinner plate (roughly 20 cm in diameter). Each galette is roughly the size of a palm and about 1.5-2 cm thick. Millet and bean patties are quite dense due to the grains and legumes content. A single galette of this size typically weighs around 70-90 grams. With three galettes present, the total weight ranges roughly between 210 and 270 grams. Considering the visual compactness and relative size, a midpoint estimate of around 240 grams for all three galettes combined is reasonable. Dividing by three, the average weight per galette is about 80 grams. Since the task is to estimate the weight for the named food item (plural 'galettes'), I consider it to mean all three patties combined. Therefore, the estimated weight of the galettes millet haricots noirs maïs is approximately 240 grams."

The 'salade de carotte, mais, tomates' is the mixed salad placed at the top right of the plate. It consists of grated carrot, corn kernels, cherry tomato halves, and visible leafy greens, likely spinach. The salad looks creamy, suggesting the presence of dressing or mayonnaise which adds some moisture and weight. The portion occupies roughly a small to medium-sized spoonful area on the plate, approximately 9-10 cm in diameter and about 1-2 cm thick. Considering the density of grated carrot mixed with corn (moderate density) and dressing, this portion likely weighs more than a simple shredded veggie salad. An estimated range would be 80 to 110 grams given the volume and density observed. Splitting the difference to a precise value, I estimate approximately 95 grams for the salad."

The specified food item is 'pâtes'. In the image, the pasta are spiral fusilli type, occupying about one third of the plate. The plate appears to be a standard dinner plate, roughly 25-27 cm in diameter, giving a good size reference. The pasta portion looks moderately dense and moist but not heavily sauced, suggesting it is cooked and weighs more than dry pasta. The quantity is fairly compact and covers an area about 10-12 cm in width and 4-5 cm in thickness when piled. From visual estimation and common plated pasta portion sizes in Switzerland, the visible portion of pasta likely weighs between 140 and 180 grams. Placing the estimate near the midpoint for precision, I conclude approximately 160 grams of cooked pasta is present."

The image shows three slices of bread ('pain') on a plate. Each slice appears to be of medium thickness, roughly the length of a typical hand span index finger to pinky (about 10-12 cm). The bread seems to be a dense rustic or whole grain variety, which usually weighs more than light white bread. Considering the size and thickness of each slice, a typical slice of this type of bread weighs approximately 35-45 grams. Since there are three slices visible, the total weight for the bread would be roughly in the range of 105-135 grams. I will take the midpoint of this range to give a precise estimate. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'pain' on the plate to be around 120 grams."

The croissants au jambon are the two small croissants on the upper left side of the plate. They appear to be standard small ham-filled croissants, slightly browned on top. Each croissant is a bit smaller than the palm of an average adult hand, roughly 7-8 cm long. Typically, a small filled croissant with ham weighs about 60-80 grams. Considering their size and the visible fullness with ham, the weight for these two croissants combined is likely between 120 and 160 grams. Splitting the difference for a single croissant's weight, I estimate about 70 grams for one croissant au jambon."

The image shows a single scoop of hazelnut ice cream (glace noisette) placed in a small decorative bowl. The bowl appears to be about the size of a typical dessert bowl, roughly 12-14 cm in diameter, and the scoop is fairly compact but not very large. Ice cream has a creamy and somewhat airy yet dense texture, which typically weighs about 0.5 grams per cubic centimeter. Given the visible size of the scoop—approximately 7-8 cm long, 3-4 cm wide, and about 3-4 cm high—this corresponds to an estimated volume of roughly 70-90 cubic centimeters. Using density, this would translate to 70-90 grams. Considering these observations and the visible quantity, the plausible weight range for this serving is between 70 and 90 grams. The midpoint and logical estimate is therefore around 80 grams."

The image shows a bowl containing a creamy mixture with visible small black chia seeds dispersed throughout. The mixture is described as 'séré maigre', which is a low-fat curd cheese, here combined with chia seeds and hazelnut puree. The bowl is about small-to-medium size based on the relative size of the spoon handle and the woven placemat. The mixture fills just over half of the bowl with a fairly thick consistency. Given that low-fat curd cheese is dense but not overly heavy, and considering the chia seeds add very little volume but some texture, the overall density is close to that of a thick yogurt or curd. A bowl of this visible size with this fill level likely contains about 150-200 grams of this mixture. Given the visible volume and density, I estimate the weight of the 'séré maigre' portion to be approximately 175 grams."

Each cracker is thin and rectangular, typical of Blevita crispbreads, and the size can be estimated relative to the standard dimensions of these products, which is about 12 cm by 7 cm. The crackers appear to be the flavored variety with a reddish color. Given that one standard Blevita crispbread weighs around 12 grams, and these crackers appear very similar in thickness and density, the total weight for four would be approximately 48 grams. Considering minimal variation in size and compact stacking, an estimated weight range might be 45-50 grams, so 48 grams is a reasonable midpoint estimate for the four Blevita crackers shown."

The chips are light and slightly porous, with visible green and dark bean pieces indicating mixed ingredients. The plate is standard-sized, about 22-24 cm diameter, and the chips occupy the central part of the plate in a loose pile that is roughly 3-4 cm high. Considering the thinness and airiness of the chips, their density would be low, similar to a typical bean chip or tortilla chip. A roughly fist-sized portion of such chips typically ranges between 25 to 45 grams in weight. Given the volume seen here—a moderate mound but not overly packed—the chips likely weigh about 35 grams.

The 'tomme fleurette' is identifiable on the plate as the two small rectangular slices near the bottom-middle of the plate, just above the slice of brie and cheese de chèvre frais. These pieces are medium thickness, similar in size but slightly smaller than the slice of bread. Tomme cheeses typically have a medium density, somewhat firm but not very heavy per volume. By comparing the size of these cheese slices to the bread slice and the small chunk of butter nearby, each slice likely weighs around 15-20 grams. Given there are two small pieces, the combined weight appears to be in the range of 30-40 grams. Placing the estimate near the midpoint, I conclude the tomme fleurette weighs approximately 35 grams."

The target food item is 'pain' (bread), identified as two small slices on a white plate. Each slice appears to be approximately half the size of a typical slice of country-style bread, with a light, airy crumb and a moderately thick crust. The bread looks toasted but not compressed, and the two pieces together roughly correspond to one medium slice broken into two parts. A standard medium slice of artisan bread generally weighs around 40-50 grams. Considering the portion here is about one full slice broken into two halves, the reasonable weight range is 40-50 grams, with 45 grams near the midpoint. The visible volume, thickness, and density align with this estimate, so I judge the total weight of the bread present on the plate as approximately 45 grams."

The portion is spread out loosely but appears to be a single serving with a fluffy texture. The scrambled eggs likely come from approximately 2 to 3 large eggs based on volume and typical serving sizes. A large egg weighs about 50 grams, but once scrambled and cooked, the total weight would be slightly less due to water loss, although this loss is small. The volume on the plate looks like about 100-150 grams of scrambled eggs. Considering this and the density of cooked eggs, a plausible weight range would be 110 to 140 grams. Selecting the midpoint for precision, I estimate the weight at 125 grams. This is consistent with the amount of scrambled eggs visible on the plate and aligns with typical portion sizes seen in Swiss meals."

The salad consists of lettuce leaves, carrot strips, and pieces of avocado, all lightly coated with oil and vinegar as indicated. The portion occupies roughly one third to one half of a standard dinner plate (about 23 cm in diameter). The pile is moderately dense, with some volume created by the leafy greens and carrots, and additional density from the avocado chunks. Considering the typical densities: lettuce is light (about 15g per medium handful), carrots moderately dense (about 30-40g for the amount seen), and avocado quite dense and creamy (likely around 40-50g given the visible chunks). The dressing adds very little weight beyond the vegetables. Overall, the salad portion seems to be between 130 to 160 grams, with the avocado and carrot making up most of the weight beyond the lettuce.

Each spear looks to be about 12-15 cm long and of average diameter. Cooked asparagus typically weigh about 10-12 grams per spear. Given the quantity and size, the total weight of the asparagus is likely in the range of 80-100 grams. A midpoint estimate accounting for some variability and moisture loss during cooking would be about 90 grams. This aligns well with the visual appearance and portion relative to the other foods on the plate."

The specified food item is 'salade', which appears on the right side of the red plate in the image. The salad portion is relatively small, consisting mainly of leafy greens with some chopped pieces and a bit of dressing visible. Considering the density of leafy greens, which is quite low compared to cooked grains like the risotto on the left, the volume of the salad is small, about the size of a handful or less. The plate is large, and the salad occupies only a small fraction of it. Based on typical leafy salad density and visual volume, the salad weighs approximately between 25 and 40 grams. A midpoint estimate near 32 grams is reasonable given the visual cues and density. This estimate excludes any dressing weight as negligible within the salad bulk."

The poivron (red bell pepper) pieces are visible near the center of the plate, cut into strips. They appear cooked or sautéed, which slightly reduces their volume and water content. The total visible amount is roughly a small handful, spread out on the plate, comparable in area to the diced chicken nearby but less dense. Considering the size of the plate and comparing the poivron strips to the avocado slices and chicken pieces, I estimate the weight of the poivron to be between 50 and 70 grams. Bell peppers are mostly water but cooked volume looks reduced, so a midpoint estimate is around 60 grams. This aligns well with the portion size and visual fullness on the plate."

The sauce vinaigrette is visible as a light dressing on top of the tofu, carrots, beetroot, mango, and some scattered on the quinoa and avocado. The total amount of visible vinaigrette appears moderate, consistent with a light coating rather than a heavy pour. Given the container size and distribution, a typical vinaigrette portion would be around 10-15 grams to lightly dress such a meal. Considering the volume and the fluid nature of vinaigrette, and comparing it to the size of the other ingredients, a reasonable estimate would be approximately 12 grams."

The mozzarella is the white, soft cheese-like portion placed on top of the cooked pasta. It appears to be a single dollop, roughly the size of a large spoonful. Considering the visual volume relative to the pasta and beans, and knowing that fresh mozzarella or similar soft cheese has a density close to that of water but slightly less due to air pockets, the portion looks like about 1/8 to 1/6 of a standard 125g ball of mozzarella. The amount is substantial enough to be approximately 60-80 grams. Checking the balance of the plate, this amount fits well with the serving size of the other components and does not look overly large or too small. Therefore, I estimate the mozzarella weight to be around 70 grams, which is near the midpoint of the visual plausible range."

The image shows a chocolate bar, partially unwrapped and held in one hand. The chocolate bar is a 'branche de chocolat,' a chocolate stick with a slightly irregular surface due to embedded nuts or crisped rice. Judging by the size of the fingers holding it, the bar is about 10 cm long and approximately 2 cm wide and 1 cm thick. These dimensions, combined with the typical density of chocolate and similar bars, suggest a weight range of about 35-45 grams. The chocolate bar is not fully unwrapped, but it looks intact and whole. Given the visible bulk and known typical weights of similar individual chocolate bars, I estimate the weight at about 40 grams."

The framboises (raspberries) are clearly visible on the plate at the bottom right, near the three larger strawberries. There are about 7 raspberries, medium-sized and fresh. Each raspberry typically weighs between 3 to 5 grams. Given the visible size and typical density, estimating a weight range of 20 to 30 grams for the whole cluster is reasonable. The raspberries are not overly packed but appear fresh and plump, so I choose a midpoint estimate around 25 grams. This aligns well with the visual bulk and the relative sizing of the berries compared to the bread slice and strawberries on the plate."

The 'beurre' (butter) portion is the small rectangular block placed near the upper right side of the plate. Comparing its size to the adjacent slice of trout and cheese pieces, as well as the size of the knife and fork nearby, this butter piece appears to be roughly 3-4 cm long, 1.5 cm wide, and about 1 cm thick. Butter is dense and uniform. Given the compact size, this portion likely weighs between 12 and 18 grams. Picking a midpoint, I estimate the weight of the butter at about 15 grams. This fits plausibly with typical small serving sizes and looks consistent with the overall plate composition."

The salade verte is visible on the bottom right portion of the plate. It consists mainly of iceberg lettuce mixed with a light dressing. The portion occupies a small section of the plate, roughly equivalent in volume to a small handful of lettuce leaves. Lettuce is very light and contains a lot of water, so even though it appears voluminous, the weight is relatively low. Given the visible amount and typical density of dressed leafy salad, I estimate a weight range of 25-40 grams, with a reasonable midpoint estimate of about 33 grams."

The 'pousses de graines' (sprouts) are visible in the center-left part of the bowl, mixed with fresh spinach leaves and halved cherry tomatoes. The sprouts cover a moderate surface area and appear loosely packed, typical for sprouted seeds. Considering their light, airy texture and low density, the volume seen corresponds to a relatively small weight. The bowl is a medium size for a salad, and the sprouts seem to occupy an approximate volume similar to a small handful, about 30-50 grams. Taking into account the visual fullness and relative volume compared to the other foods, I estimate the weight of the sprouts to be around 40 grams."

The salade (salad) is visible on the left side of the red plate and consists mainly of leafy green lettuce with some sunflower seeds sprinkled on top. The salad portion occupies about one third of the plate's surface. Lettuce has a low density and is voluminous but light. Considering typical leafy salad portion sizes, and the amount of leaves visible which appear loosely arranged but covering a reasonable area, I estimate the salad's weight to be between 30 to 50 grams. Picking a value near the midpoint for accuracy and consistency with similar visual portions, I estimate the salad weight to be approximately 40 grams."

The salami is visible as several thin slices on the right side of the plate. Each slice looks roughly the size of a small coin and there are about 6 to 7 slices, some broken. Salami is dense and fatty, with a typical weight for thin slices about 3-5 grams each. Considering the total volume and the way the slices are stacked and partly overlapping, the overall portion likely weighs between 20 and 30 grams. The midpoint estimate, accounting for some broken pieces and the visual bulk, would be about 25 grams. This estimate fits the plate's scale and the size of other food items like the radishes and the bread slice."

The image shows two slices of bread on a white plate. One slice is spread with orange jam (confiture), and the other slice has a layer of Nutella. Both slices appear to have a layer of butter underneath the spreads, as some butter is visible through the spreads and near the edges. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes and visual cues, the butter spread is relatively thin but covers most of the bread surface on both slices. Each slice likely has around 6-9 grams of butter spread evenly. Since the target is 'beurre' and both slices have butter, I consider the total visible butter spread on both slices combined. Thus, the total butter is likely around 12-18 grams. To be precise and conservative, I estimate the butter weight at about 15 grams in total for the two slices. This accounts for a thin but not minimal spread, consistent with visible thickness and coverage."

The target food item is 'oeufs' (eggs), which are visible as two fried eggs placed on top of a portion of cooked pasta. The eggs appear fully cooked with yolks partially runny and whites spread out but intact. Considering the size of the plate and comparing with the pasta underneath, the eggs look like standard large eggs. A single large fried egg typically weighs about 45-55 grams once cooked, accounting for some moisture loss. Here there are two eggs, so the combined weight likely ranges between 90 and 110 grams. The eggs are not broken into small pieces or heavily reduced, so a midpoint estimate of about 100 grams is reasonable. This estimate also aligns with the visual bulk and the relation to the pasta portion."

The mayonnaise is visible as a dollop on the left side of the plate. It appears to be a typical serving size, roughly equivalent to about 2 to 3 tablespoons of mayonnaise. Considering the density of mayonnaise, which is creamy and dense but not very heavy, the volume on the plate corresponds to approximately 30 to 45 grams. Given the visible size relative to the fork and other items on the plate, it is closer to the middle of this range. Hence, I estimate the mayonnaise weight to be about 38 grams."

The image shows a single piece of a Kinder chocolate bar placed on a wooden surface. This piece is a typical segment of the Kinder Bueno or Kinder Chocolate bar, which are well-known confectionery products. The size of this segment relative to the wood grain suggests it is small and slim. A standard full Kinder Bueno bar weighs about 21.5 grams in total, usually divided into 2 or 4 pieces. Given this is a single segment, and considering the visible dimensions and typical packaging, the weight is likely around 10 to 12 grams. Given the visible size and thickness, the best estimate is approximately 11 grams."

The avocado (avocat) is visible as two medium-sized slices placed on the wrap near the top center. Avocado is dense and creamy, with each typical slice of this size weighing roughly 20-25 grams depending on thickness. Given the visible amount, it looks like about half of an avocado is present, which generally weighs around 80-100 grams whole. Here, the slices are slightly thick but not very large. Estimating between 40 and 55 grams seems reasonable. Taking a midpoint reflective of the visible volume and thickness, I estimate the avocado weight to be around 48 grams."

The specified food item is the 'tartine mélasse + beurre' which is the smaller slice of bread on the plate with a visible spread of butter and molasses. The toast slice appears to be about 12-13 cm long and 5-6 cm wide, typical for a small rustic bread slice. The bread thickness looks to be around 2-2.5 cm. Considering bread density, this slice likely weighs between 30 and 45 grams on its own. The butter layer is thin but visible and would contribute about 5-7 grams. The molasses spread looks light and glossy, covering most of the bread surface but thin, which would add approximately 5 grams, considering molasses density. Summing these, the total weight of the 'tartine mélasse + beurre' is estimated between 40 and 57 grams. Choosing a midpoint close to 48 grams seems reasonable given the bread size and spread coverage. This estimate aligns with the visible volume and texture without excessive assumptions."

The food item to estimate is 'graine de chia', which is visible as small black seeds dispersed throughout the yogurt and oat mixture inside the jar. The jar is moderately filled, and the chia seeds are mixed uniformly but in a relatively small proportion compared to the overall contents. Chia seeds have a relatively high density but are small in volume. Typically, the amount of chia seeds added in such a jar of overnight oats or similar preparations ranges between 10 to 20 grams. Given the visible density and coverage in the jar, the chia seeds likely weigh around 15 grams within the mixture. This estimate balances the visible spread of seeds and typical portion sizes for chia in such preparations."

The fresh spinach ('épinards frais') is clearly visible as a base layer in the bowl. The spinach leaves are fresh and whole, covering a significant portion of the bowl underneath the other items, with some leaves also around the edges. Spinach is leafy and light with a typical density around 0.25 g/cm³. Considering the visible volume and the fact that spinach leaves don't compress heavily, this looks like about one generous handful, roughly filling a quarter to a third of the bowl's bottom area. Given the bowl size relative to the falafel and cherry tomatoes, this spinach likely weighs around 50 to 70 grams. Placing the estimate near the midpoint, I conclude the spinach weight is about 60 grams, which is plausible given its volume and density compared to the other items in the bowl."

The 'maréchal' cheese pieces are visible in the center of the plate, cut into small cubes. Based on the size of the cheese cubes relative to the cucumber slices and eggs, the cubes are small but dense. There are about five visible cubes, each roughly 1.5 cm³ in size. Given that maréchal is a semi-hard cheese with a density close to typical cheddar-type cheeses (~1.1 g/cm³), each cube would weigh about 4-5 grams. Multiplying by the number of cubes, the total visible weight is approximately 20-25 grams. Considering slight variation in cube size and density, a weighted midpoint estimate of 22 grams is appropriate."

The target food item is ""yaourt nature"" (plain yogurt), shown in a small white plastic container filled to near the top. The container is a standard size for single-serving yogurt pots commonly found in Switzerland, which generally contain around 125 grams of yogurt. Visually, the yogurt looks smooth and creamy without any visible addition, indicating it is likely plain yogurt. The full appearance and typical container size strongly suggest the weight is close to 125 grams. The apple beside it helps confirm the relative size of the cup as standard for this type of product.

The image shows a single slice of pizza on a standard-sized dinner plate. The slice looks to be a small portion of a regular pizza, with a thickness typical of a thin to medium crust. There are visible toppings including mushrooms and some sauce. The plate diameter and the fork provide size references. Considering a typical single pizza slice weighs around 100 to 150 grams, and given this slice is smaller than a full standard slice (it appears to be about a third to half a regular slice size), I estimate the weight of this pizza slice to be between 40 and 60 grams. Choosing a midpoint, a good estimate is 50 grams. This accounts for the dough, tomato sauce, cheese, and mushrooms realistically proportioned for the visible slice size."

The target food item is 'pain,' which is the slice of bread visible at the top of the plate. The slice appears to be a medium-thickness piece of whole grain or brown bread, typical of Swiss-style bread. The slice nearly covers one-third of the plate with a typical diameter around 20-22 cm. Considering the density of regular whole grain bread, a single slice of this size usually weighs between 35 and 45 grams. Given the visible thickness and size, the estimate should be near the midpoint of that range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the slice of bread to be approximately 40 grams."

The hummous is located on the bottom left section of the plate. It appears as a creamy, slightly peaked smear or scoop. Comparing its size to nearby items such as the cottage cheese (which is a similar quantity and texture but more solid) and the olives above it, the hummous portion roughly corresponds to about two tablespoons. Considering that a tablespoon of hummous typically weighs around 15-20 grams, this portion likely weighs about 30-40 grams total. The hummous looks dense but spread in a moderate-sized scoop. Therefore, a midpoint estimate of about 35 grams is reasonable and plausible given the visible volume and density."

Each pat could be estimated roughly around 5-7 grams based on typical thickness and size. Together, the two pieces look to total about 12 grams of butter. Considering the density of butter and its solid appearance, this is a reasonable estimation given the visible volume and portion size. The rest of the plate offers context with moderate portion sizes of other items, confirming this butter amount is consistent with an accompaniment portion."

The slice at the top has butter and molasses, while the slice at the bottom is spread with Nutella. Focusing on the butter on the top slice, the butter appears melted and spread thinly but covering much of the surface of the slice. Considering the size of a standard slice of bread in Switzerland, which typically weighs around 40-50 grams, and judging the thickness and coverage of the butter, the butter portion likely weighs between 8 and 14 grams. Butter is dense and spreads thinly but evenly here. Given this, I estimate the butter amount as approximately 11 grams, near the midpoint of the range. This is plausible given the visible layer of butter over the slice without excessive thickness."

Given their moderate size, and the portion fitting on a small dessert plate, the overall weight of the blueberries is likely between 20 and 30 grams. Centering near the midpoint of this range for a precise estimate, I suggest about 25 grams of blueberries are present, consistent with the visible portion and typical berry density."
2ahgvr,toast,55.0,60.0,5.0,0.03335759340126152,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/feb15752-d5e3-4f73-8eeb-9fb560cc6f6b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two slices of toast bread on a plate, each with a thin spread of fromage frais (fresh cheese). Typical slice of toast bread weighs around 30 grams. The fromage frais is spread relatively thinly but evenly across both slices, likely about 5 grams per slice given the thin layer and visible coverage. Therefore, the total weight of the fromage frais spread on both slices can be estimated around 10 grams. The question only asks for the weight of 'toast', so focusing on the bread alone, each slice is approximately 30 grams, making two slices about 60 grams in total. Since the slices are standard size and thickness, 60 grams is a reasonable estimate for the toast portion visible."
p96w4a,flocon d'avoines,13.0,8.5,4.5,0.007096069868995633,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/c0fc63a2-21db-448b-875a-c736a595bd0a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a white bowl containing two types of seeds or flakes: the right side shows the 'flocon d'avoines' (oat flakes), while the left side shows another darker seed, possibly flaxseed. The oat flakes occupy roughly half the bowl's bottom surface, in a relatively thin layer. Considering the density of dry oat flakes, which is approximately 350 grams per liter, and estimating that this layer is quite thin but spread out over about half the bowl's bottom (with a diameter likely around 16 cm), the volume can be roughly estimated at about 20-30 ml. This corresponds to a weight range of approximately 7-10 grams. Given this, I estimate the oat flakes in the bowl to weigh about 8.5 grams, as a midpoint estimate within that plausible range."
2ahgvr,graines de chia,8.0,12.0,4.0,0.0038816108685104317,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/aa859e5b-563f-472c-9914-036722ebf60e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'graines de chia' (chia seeds), which appear mixed into the bowl along with blanc battu (whipped egg whites or similar), oat flakes, and honey. Visually, the chia seeds are small black specks evenly distributed throughout the mixture. The total volume of the bowl contents appears to be about half full of a creamy, dense mixture. Given chia seeds are very small and light, but the quantity visible is moderate within a fairly dense preparation, I estimate that the chia seeds contribute a small portion of the mix by weight. Typically, one tablespoon of chia seeds weighs about 12 grams and appears as a small but visible volume. Here, the amount seems roughly equivalent to about 1 tablespoon or slightly less. Considering this and their distribution, I estimate the weight of the chia seeds present to be approximately between 10 and 15 grams, with a midpoint around 12 grams. This aligns well with the visible density and volume of the seeds in the mix without overestimating their presence."
2ahgvr,crème de marrons,13.0,17.0,4.0,0.006307617661329452,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/6b1cc73c-e22b-4132-970e-e37910b8b407,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small piece of bread (pain) with a spread of crème de marrons on top. The bread is rustic, with an open crumb structure, and the piece is roughly 10 cm long and 3-4 cm wide at its widest part. The crème de marrons layer looks moderately thick but not overly applied — it seems to be a thin yet generous spread covering the exposed bread surface. Given that crème de marrons is dense and somewhat sticky, the amount covering this piece is likely to weigh more than if it were a light jam or jelly. The spread appears to be about 2-3 mm thick on average. Considering the size and thickness, the crème de marrons portion on this piece of bread would likely weigh between 15 to 20 grams. Taking a midpoint estimate for precision, I estimate around 17 grams. This seems plausible given the visual volume, density, and area covered."

The specified food item 'mélasse' appears as a thin spread on one slice of bread in the top half of the plate. The slice of bread is an average-sized piece of rustic-style bread, approximately 12-14 cm in length and 6-7 cm in width, typical for a slice weighing around 50-60 grams. The spread of mélasse is thin and uneven, covering about 70-80% of the bread surface. Molasses is dense and sticky, but the thin application means a relatively small quantity. Given the visual coverage and density, the portion of mélasse here likely weighs between 8 and 12 grams. A midpoint value would be close to 10 grams, which seems plausible based on the spread thickness and surface area covered."

The oeuf (egg) is visible on the plate as a half of a boiled egg, with a slightly soft yolk, situated near the upper right part of the plate. A whole medium boiled egg typically weighs around 50 grams, including shell, but here it is peeled and only half is present, so approximately 25 grams. Given some small visible portion of yolk and egg white, and cross-checking with the portion size of other foods such as rice and vegetables on the plate, the half egg fits well with this standard estimate. The piece does not appear unusually large or small compared to the rice grains and cherry tomatoes. The plausible range for half a medium egg is roughly 22 to 28 grams, so the chosen midpoint estimate is 25 grams."

The œuf dur (hard-boiled egg) is clearly visible on the left side of the plate, cut into two halves. The size of the egg halves compared to the fork and knife appears to be standard for a typical chicken egg. A standard hard-boiled egg without shell weighs roughly 50-60 grams in total. Since both halves representing the whole egg are present, the estimated weight is around the full egg weight, slightly adjusted for moisture loss due to cooking. Considering this, a plausible range is 50-58 grams, and I choose a midpoint estimate of 54 grams."
ppf8hc,parmesan,14.0,18.0,4.0,0.006792819019893256,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/2833b10a-52c7-409b-ad86-f6147c323f9e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The parmesan is mixed into the risotto dish rather than presented in a separate quantity. Given the visual appearance of the risotto with asparagus, the cheese is likely grated and incorporated into the dish, resulting in a relatively small but noticeable amount. Parmesan is dense but the total visible volume attributed to it is small compared to the rice and asparagus. For an average serving of risotto with cheese, the parmesan content is typically between 10 and 25 grams. Based on the visible size of the risotto portion on the plate and the evident creaminess indicating cheese presence, I estimate the parmesan weight to be around 18 grams, which is near the middle of that range. This estimate makes sense considering the overall portion size and the typical cheese quantity used for flavoring such a dish."

The image shows a single slice of tresse bread that has some butter spread on it. The slice is of medium thickness and the butter layer is thin and evenly spread but visible under the apricot jam. With standard butter density and thickness typical for spreading on bread, the butter coverage here looks like about 5 to 7 grams. Given the size of the bread slice is roughly the size of a typical slice of braided bread (about 10 cm length), this thin but sufficient spreading suggests the butter weight is close to 6 grams, sitting comfortably in a range of 5 to 7 grams. This estimate excludes the bread and jam, focusing only on the butter layer as requested."

The target food item is 'pain', which is a slice of bread visible in the image. The bread appears to be a rustic or country-style type with a coarse crust and an airy crumb texture. The slice is roughly 10 cm long and 5-6 cm wide, with moderate thickness (around 2.5-3 cm). Given the density of such bread, a slice of this size typically weighs between 40 and 55 grams. There is some topping (caviar d'aubergines) on the bread, but it is not part of the 'pain' estimation and does not affect the bread's weight. The surrounding plate and hand provide scale, confirming the slice is medium-sized but not overly thick or heavy. Considering the volume and texture, a midpoint estimate around 48 grams for the bread slice is reasonable and plausible."

The target food item is 'pain' which is visually identifiable as a single small slice of white bread on a plate. The size of the bread slice is roughly half of a standard small baguette slice or similar, approximately 10 cm by 8 cm. White bread generally has a density around 0.25 g/cm3 and standard slices weigh between 25-40g. Given this piece's size and thickness (visible crumb structure suggests a typical slice thickness), the weight should be close to a small slice portion, around 30 to 40 grams. Considering the bread is not overly thick or thin, I estimate the weight to be about 35 grams."

The biscuit is visible in the glass on top of the ice cream, mostly broken into a few pieces with a reddish topping (likely syrup or jam). The biscuit pieces are thin and crisp, roughly covering a small surface area on the ice cream. Given their appearance and typical density for this type of light biscuit or wafer, the total biscuit portion is small. The biscuit pieces appear to weigh in total around 8-12 grams due to their thinness and size. Taking a midpoint for precision, I estimate the biscuit weight to be around 10 grams."

The target food item is 'carottes' (carrots), which are visible as several thin slices and small pieces mixed among the pasta and aubergines in a medium-sized bowl. The carrot pieces are thinly sliced, some slightly curved, and scattered but not densely packed. Given the size relative to the bowl and comparing with the amount of pasta and aubergine, the total volume of the carrots is moderate but not stacked. Carrots are moderately dense, and considering the visible amount, a plausible weight range for the carrots would be between 30 grams (minimum) and 50 grams (maximum). The best estimate near the midpoint is about 40 grams, reflecting the scattered but noticeable presence of carrot slices throughout the dish."

The image shows a blue bowl containing several food items. The specified item, 'huile de lin' (linseed oil), is a liquid oil and if present on the plate, would most likely be applied as a drizzle or mixed lightly into one of the items. There is no visible small pool or bottle of oil on the plate, nor a clear glossy oily surface that would markedly indicate a substantial amount. Given the typical use of linseed oil as a finishing or dressing oil in small quantities (often about 5-10g for flavoring rather than a main ingredient), and the lack of visible oil pooling, it is reasonable to estimate a minimal amount here, approximately one tablespoon or less. Visual cues support an estimate near 7 grams, with a plausible range of 5-10 grams considering household use."

The salade de céleri is located at the bottom right of the plate. It appears as a small mound of thinly shredded celery root mixed with a light dressing. The portion is relatively compact and looks dense but not overly tightly packed. By comparing it to the other items on the plate, such as the roasted chicken portion and the carrot salad which is a larger pile, the salade de céleri portion is clearly the smallest side. Typically, such a portion on a plate of this size would be approximately between 40 to 60 grams based on volume and typical density of grated celery root salad. Given its size visually and texture, a midpoint estimate near 50 grams is reasonable and plausible. This fits well with the overall plate layout and volume relationships without overestimating the weight of this light but moist shredded vegetable salad."

Given the size relative to the wooden surface (likely standard table grain size) and the known average weight of a standard single Kinder Bueno bar, which is approximately 21.5 grams. There are no signs of it being broken or reduced in size. Therefore, the estimate for the weight of this 'barre de chocolat kinder' is 21.5 grams."
