From the image, we see a pizza divided into 5 visible slices, with one slice partially eaten (around half gone) and 4 others mostly intact. The pizza appears to be a standard small pizza on a normal sized plate (~26 cm diameter). Assuming this is a pizza around 26-28 cm in diameter, the typical whole pizza weight in Switzerland for a vegetable topped pizza is approximately 450-500 grams. We can count 5 visible pieces, which corresponds roughly to a full pizza cut into 6 slices with one slice missing or partially eaten, so nearly a whole pizza minus a small fraction. Since one slice is half gone, let's consider the total remaining pizza roughly 5.5 slices out of 6, equating to roughly 92% of the whole pizza. Applying 450-500g total weight gives us about 415-460g remaining. The pizza is topped generously with mushrooms, olives, and courgettes, which do not add significant extra weight beyond typical toppings. Hence, the estimate centers around 450g, acknowledging slight margin. Therefore, the best defensible estimate for the weight of the pizza slices present in the image is 450 grams."

The food item specified is 'tomates cerises' (cherry tomatoes). From the image, the cherry tomatoes are contained in a small cardboard punnet typical for Swiss retail packaging. The punnet appears to be about one standard 250 g size, judging by its dimensions relative to the visible book and the cloth pattern beneath. There are approximately 18-20 cherry tomatoes visible, arranged in a single layer with some on the vine. Typical Swiss cherry tomato weighs about 8-12 grams each. Given the tomatoes fill most of the punnet and look fresh and firmly packed, I estimate the total weight in the punnet close to the full 250 g retail weight. Cross-checking by counting units: around 18 tomatoes × about 10 g average = 180 g, which might be a slight undercount if some tomatoes are smaller or hidden underneath. The visual fullness and packaging size suggest closer to 230-250 g rather than just 180 g. Therefore, the more accurate estimate weighing fullness and container size is 240 g, reflecting a near-full 250 g punnet of cherry tomatoes."
xjvrtk,galettes millet haricots noirs maïs,155.0,330,175.0,3.218820458051501,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'galettes millet haricots noirs maïs', which are visible on the right side of the container as distinct round patties containing millet, black beans, and corn. They appear to be homemade or artisanal patties, approximately 6 pieces in the container. Each galette is roughly 6-7 cm diameter and about 1.5-2 cm thick. Considering the density of cooked millet combined with black beans and corn (which is fairly dense, similar to cooked legume patties), each galette is likely about 50-60 grams, given their size and visible compactness. 6 galettes together would therefore weigh approximately 300-360 grams. The patties fill about half the container volume on that side, and the container appears to be a typical glass food storage box of about 500-600 ml volume. This volume and visual fullness corroborates this weight estimate. Thus I estimate the total weight of the galettes millet haricots noirs maïs at around 330 grams, a reasonable mid-value between 300 and 360 grams."

The specified food item is 'courgette et oignons' (zucchini and onions). Visually, this food occupies roughly half the container on the left side. The container looks like a standard glass lunch container approximately 15 cm by 15 cm. The zucchini and onions are sliced and cooked, appearing soft and somewhat moist. The pile is about 2-3 cm deep in the container. Given the visible volume and considering the density of cooked vegetables (zucchini and onions are mostly water and have low density), the estimated density is around 0.6-0.7 g/cm³. The approximate volume is 15 cm x 7.5 cm (half the container width) x 2.5 cm depth = about 280 cm³. Multiplying volume and density, 280 cm³ × 0.65 g/cm³ ≈ 180 g. This is a reasonable portion for cooked vegetables in a lunch container and fits typical Swiss portion sizes. Therefore, the estimated weight is about 180 grams."

The specified food item is 'croissants au jambon'. In the image, there are two small croissants visible on the plate. They appear to be filled with ham, indicating 'croissants au jambon'. These croissants look like standard mini butter croissants filled with ham. Typical Swiss filled ham mini croissants weigh approximately 60-90 grams each. These croissants appear to be on the smaller side rather than full-sized croissants, so I will assume around 70 grams per croissant. Since there are two croissants, the total weight estimation would be approximately 140 grams. This aligns well with typical portion sizes for such items and the visual size of the croissants relative to the plate and nearby items (like the carrot sticks and slices of baguette). Thus, a reasonable estimate for the total weight of both croissants au jambon is about 140 grams."
wrah5h,pâtes,148.0,250,102.0,1.7913848344606622,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/115dbd14-27ca-4200-a232-fa9f3eb9bad7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'pâtes' (pasta). In the image, the pasta is the right half of the container, consisting of spiral fusilli type pasta with visible tomato-based sauce and a topping of grated parmesan. The container appears to be a standard metal lunch box approx. 20x13 cm. The pasta portion fits roughly half the container. The depth of the pasta is estimated to be about 2.5 cm, considering the container's depth and the visible food height. Pasta density when cooked is moderate to dense, similar to cooked fusilli which is about 140 g per 180 ml. The visible volume is about 20 cm × 6.5 cm × 2.5 cm = 325 cm³. Assuming 1 cm³ ≈ 1 ml, that's 325 ml. Using 140 g per 180 ml as a reference, weight is (325 ml / 180 ml) × 140 g ≈ 253 g. Cross-checking with other lunch portions and the overall size of the pasta pile, this seems reasonable. Therefore, the best estimate for the weight of the visible pasta portion is approximately 250 grams."

The specified food item is 'légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)'. Visually, the sautéed vegetables occupy about a quarter of the plate, with visible chunks and slices of carrots and leeks. The pieces are cooked and spread over a relatively flat area, not piled very high, but covering a moderate area. The typical density for sautéed vegetables is moderate and includes some moisture content but not overly dense. Considering the plate diameter (~26 cm) and the portion footprint, this looks like a modest serving. A typical cooked vegetable serving on a plate like this weighs around 80-120 grams for a similar visible volume. Given the moderate size and spread, I estimate around 100 grams for the portion of sautéed carrots and leeks. This fits within typical snack or meal cooked vegetable servings and aligns with visual observation without overestimation."

The specified food item is 'salade de carotte, mais, tomates', which is the carrot, corn, and tomato salad on the plate. Visually, the salad is placed on a standard-sized plate of about 26 cm diameter. The salad portion takes roughly a 6-7 cm diameter irregular area on the plate and appears loosely piled but somewhat dense with shredded carrot, corn kernels, and pieces of tomato mixed possibly with some dressing. The salad depth seems about 1.5 to 2 cm in most places. Given the density of shredded carrot and corn mixture—carrot being less dense but corn quite starchy—and the presence of dressing, the salad weight can be estimated by volume. Approximating the footprint as a roughly circular 6 cm diameter area (about 28 cm²), multiplied by an average thickness of around 1.5 cm, yields a volume around 42 cm³. Carrot salads weigh approximately around 0.8-1 g/cm³ due to moisture and corn density, so estimating near 40-45 g is reasonable. Cross-checking this with the visible amount against known portion sizes, this is a moderate salad serving, within typical Swiss portion norms. Therefore, 43 grams is a well-supported estimate."
wrah5h,tiramisu,72.0,150,78.0,0.6664293342826628,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/7b0475df-5b02-4072-abb9-ef75acf0f031,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two pieces of dessert on a plate — one piece of tiramisu and one piece of forêt noir. The specified food item to estimate is tiramisu. The tiramisu portion appears as a typical slice, about 10 cm long, 4-5 cm wide, and roughly 4 cm high. This is a standard small serving size. Tiramisu tends to be dense with cream, mascarpone cheese, soaked sponge cake, etc., so it has moderate density, roughly similar to that of a small slice of layered cake. A standard serving of tiramisu in Swiss cafés or stores usually weighs between 120-180 g per slice of this size. Visually comparing the tiramisu piece thickness and density to forest noir slice on the same plate and considering general portion norms, the tiramisu appears to be somewhat lighter than a dense chocolate cake slice but still substantial. No container or packaging is visible, so direct volume and size estimation applies. Given these observations, a reasonable weight estimate is about 150 grams for this tiramisu piece, balancing the visible volume and typical density. This estimate fits well within Swiss typical ranges and looks plausible by comparison to the other dessert on the plate."

The image shows three strawberries (fraises) in a small bowl. The strawberries are large-sized compared to the bowl and each looks quite plump. Typical Swiss strawberries weigh between 15-25 g each. Given the size and visual fullness of each strawberry here, they appear on the upper end of typical weight. Estimating around 25 g for the largest strawberry and about 20 g each for the other two gives a total estimate around 65-70 g. Since the strawberries are quite sizeable but not overly large, a sensible estimate would be around 70 grams total for the three fraises in the bowl."

The image shows a slice of tarte aux fraises (strawberry tart) on a plate about 26 cm in diameter. The slice is a portion of a whole tart, likely cut into approximately 6 to 8 slices given the size and shape. The tart has a visible pastry crust, a creamy filling, and strawberry topping. The strawberries on the tart are medium-sized, with about 6-7 whole strawberries halved or cut, with some redcurrants as well adding to weight. Considering a typical whole strawberry tart in Switzerland weighs roughly 500-700 grams (including pastry, cream, and strawberries), a single slice would weigh roughly one-sixth to one-eighth of that. Given this slice does not seem overly thick but has generous cream and fruit topping, an estimate around 80-110 grams is plausible. Checking strawberry size, an average strawberry weighs about 18-22 grams; here, about 6 halves correspond roughly to 3 whole strawberries, about 60 grams of strawberries. The cream and crust volume seems lighter but not negligible, about 30-40 grams. Therefore, the most reasonable estimate for this slice of tarte aux fraises is about 95 grams, balancing fruit, cream, and crust. This estimate fits typical Swiss dessert slice weights and the visual portion size and ingredients visible in the image."

The plate has a piece of cooked meat labeled as 'viande'. The meat piece is roughly rectangular and about the size of a palm, slightly charred on the edges, indicating it's likely ground meat, possibly a meat patty or similar. The plate diameter looks standard, around 26 cm, and the meat portion occupies roughly a 10 cm by 6 cm area with moderate thickness, which visually appears to be about 1.5 - 2 cm thick. Ground cooked meat density is approximately 1 g/cm³. Estimating volume: 10 cm × 6 cm × 1.5 cm = 90 cm³ minimum, or up to 10×6×2=120 cm³ max. This translates to an estimated weight between 90 g and 120 g. Comparing with Swiss typical cooked ground beef portions: a moderate serving for dinner is usually around 100-150 g. Given the size and thickness seen, 110 g is a reasonable estimate, balancing between volume and typical portions. Cross-checking: This fits the expected size and visual density for a cooked ground meat piece of this size. Thus, 110 g is a justified estimate."

The specified foods are galettes millet, haricots noirs, and maïs, which appear here mixed into 5 small round patties in the dish. These patties are about the size of small to medium burger sliders, roughly 6-7 cm diameter each, and look dense but slightly crumbly. Typical millet galettes with beans and corn have a density somewhat similar to patties made from cooked legumes mixed with grains, which are denser than vegetables but less dense than meat. Each galette appears roughly 1 cm thick, giving a volume of around 25-30 cm³ per piece (area of a 6 cm diameter circle ≈28 cm² × 1 cm thickness). For density, a reasonable estimate for these patties is about 1 g/cm³ since they contain cooked ingredients with some moisture. Thus, one patty weighs approximately 25-30 g. There are 5 patties visible, so total estimated weight is roughly 5 × 27 g = 135 g. The other food items (tomatoes and onions) do not add weight to each patty as we're only estimating the galettes millet, haricots noirs, maïs. Given the visual size, distribution, and typical portion weights, 130-140 g range is plausible, so final estimate is 135 g."

The food item to estimate is 'salade de pâtes', visible on a standard white plate (approximately 26 cm in diameter). The portion of pasta salad left is relatively small, spread in the center. The pasta appears to be penne, mixed with small corn kernels and halved cherry tomatoes. The density of cooked pasta is relatively high. A full serving of pasta salad in a restaurant context is typically around 150-250 g. However, the visible amount here is clearly a small leftover portion, roughly one-third or less of a full serving. Visually, this looks like 8-10 pieces of penne, some corn, and two halves of cherry tomato. Given the modest pile height, likely less than 1 cm, the total weight of this visible leftover pasta salad is estimated to be around 50 grams. This aligns with typical cooked pasta contributing most weight, plus the small vegetable bits. Thus, 50 g is a reasonable and plausible estimate."

The portion of spaghetti covers the central area of the plate with a visible height and density consistent with cooked pasta. The spaghetti strands are loosely piled and not excessively dense. A typical cooked spaghetti portion seen here would be about 1 to 1.5 cups (240 to 360 ml volume). Cooked pasta in Swiss reference is dense, approximately 120-140 g per 180 ml. Considering this portion looks medium-sized and not heaped full, an estimate around 150-180 grams is reasonable. Given the plate size and the visible amount, the weight of cooked spaghetti here is estimated close to 160 grams, balancing moderate quantity with visible volume and typical density."

We need to estimate the weight of 'pain bis' (brown bread) visible in the image. The bread is shown as two slices, one with mayonnaise spread and the other topped with cheese strips and cornichons. The slices appear fairly standard size and thickness for Swiss whole grain or brown bread, roughly 1.5 cm thick. A typical slice of Swiss pain bis weighs about 40-50 g depending on thickness. Since these slices are average thickness, and each slice looks roughly 12 cm x 8 cm, the combined two slices would weigh approximately 80-100 g in total. Since we are estimating the whole visible bread (2 slices), and there are no missing parts or excessive thickness, multiplying by 45 g average per slice gives about 90 g. This fits well within Swiss norms for bread slices visible size and thickness. There are no containers or packaging to consider, and the bread density is moderate, so this estimate is reasonable."

The specified food item is 'pomme', i.e. apple. In the image, the apple is placed next to a croissant on a wooden surface. The apple appears to be a small to medium-sized Swiss apple, typical of local markets, with a squat and rounded shape but slightly elongated. Typical Swiss apples weigh between 150-220 grams depending on size. This apple looks slightly smaller than a large apple, more akin to a small-medium apple, so estimating around 160 grams seems reasonable. There is no container to adjust for or visible portion missing, so no scaling is necessary. The croissant nearby serves as a useful size reference: considering that a full-size butter croissant is 45-60 grams and the apple looks proportionally larger in volume, the apple's weight estimate aligns well with this assessment."

The food item is ""colrave crue"" (raw kohlrabi), which appears peeled and cut into multiple irregular slices laid out on a white rectangular plastic lid or tray. The tray size seems small to medium, roughly comparable to a typical plastic container lid, about 15-18 cm long. The slices look fairly thin and not stacked deep, roughly one layer only, as the tray is shallow. Kohlrabi has a density close to that of a firm vegetable similar to cabbage or turnip, approx 0.6 to 0.7 g/cm³. By visual estimation, the total volume of the pieces on the tray can be approximated by considering a rough area coverage: about 10 cm × 8 cm footprint and an average thickness of about 1 to 1.5 cm. So volume estimate is about 80 to 120 cm³. Using 0.65 g/cm³ density as a mid estimate: weight = volume × density ≈ 80 to 120 × 0.65 = 52 to 78 g. Considering the pieces are not perfectly compact and there is some air between them, a bit lower estimate near the middle margin is reasonable. A final estimate around 65 grams fits the visual and volumetric cues. This also corresponds well to typical portion sizes of raw kohlrabi served peeled and sliced. Therefore, the estimated weight of the raw kohlrabi pieces on the tray is approximately 65 grams."

The image shows a single scoop of hazelnut ice cream ('glace noisette') served in a small bowl. The bowl appears to be around 13-15 cm in diameter, judging by the typical table surface and bowl style. The scoop itself is about 7-8 cm in length and looks like a moderate-sized amount of ice cream. Based on typical density and portion sizes for a home-served scoop of premium ice cream, a scoop of this size usually weighs approximately between 90 and 120 grams. Given the modest size and somewhat compact shape, I estimate the serving here to be closer to 100 grams. This aligns well with typical Swiss portion sizes for ice cream scoops served individually and looks visually consistent with that typical weight. No packaging or container net weights apply here because this is a loose scoop on a plate. Therefore, the estimated weight of this 'glace noisette' portion is 100 grams."

The specified food item is 'asperges' (asparagus). In the image, there are about 7 green asparagus spears on the plate. They appear to be cooked and are of typical thickness and length for Swiss asparagus (around 15-20 cm). Each asparagus spear generally weighs about 15-20 grams when cooked. Considering the size and number, and comparing with other items on the plate, the total asparagus weight is estimated by multiplying 7 spears × approximately 18 g per spear, yielding roughly 126 g. This is plausible given the visible quantity and typical asparagus weights. Therefore, the weight of the asparagus on this plate is about 125 grams."

The blueberries look like standard fresh blueberries, typical size and appearance, mixed with yogurt. There are roughly 15-20 individual berries visible on top and on the sides. Assuming some are hidden underneath, estimate about 30 berries total. Swiss blueberries typically weigh about 1.5 g each. So 30 berries × 1.5 g = 45 g. This estimate matches the observed volume and visual fullness without overestimating the quantity. It is a reasonable amount mixed in the bowl and consistent with standard serving sizes of fresh blueberries used in such dishes."

Each slice looks about 12-15 cm long and 6-7 cm wide, typical of a homemade or bakery loaf slice. Standard Swiss bread slices of this type usually weigh between 40-60g depending on thickness and density. Considering these slices look moderately thick but not overly dense or heavy, estimating them around 50g each is plausible. Since both slices are on the plate and identifiable as ""pain,"" the total weight would be about 100g. To remain conservative, and since both slices are distinct and nearly full size, the total estimate for both slices together will be 100 grams. This aligns with typical Swiss bread slice weights and visible portion size without excess thickness or significant cut portions missing."

The food item to estimate is 'myrtilles' (blueberries). The blueberries are shown in a small bowl held in one hand. Using the hand and bowl size as references, the bowl appears to hold approximately one serving of blueberries. The blueberries fill the bowl roughly to the top, and they are arranged in roughly 3-4 layers, judging from the visible height and typical blueberry size. The average weight of a single blueberry is about 1.5 grams in Switzerland. By roughly counting the visible blueberries on top (about 30-35) and assuming 3 layers deep, I estimate around 90 to 105 blueberries in total. Multiplying approximately 100 blueberries by 1.5 grams each gives about 150 grams. This aligns well with typical Swiss retail clamshell weights (125 g or 250 g), and the portion here looks about half to two-thirds of a 250 g punnet. Therefore, a solid and plausible estimate is 150 grams for the blueberries in this bowl."
wrah5h,riz complet,82.0,130,48.0,0.46707013171947315,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/ee492174-b956-48fe-a4cb-4f059c9bc233,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'riz complet,' which is visible on the plate as a portion of cooked brown rice. To estimate the weight, first consider the visual volume and density. The rice portion appears to cover roughly a quarter of the plate, with a typical plate diameter about 26 cm. The rice is loosely piled to a moderate height, consistent with a typical serving. Cooked brown rice density is approximately 120-140 g per 180 ml (Swiss cup volume). The visible amount looks like roughly one cup of cooked rice or slightly less. This corresponds roughly to 130 grams. Checking relative to the other foods on the plate, the rice portion is similar in bulk to a typical Swiss serving size for a main carbohydrate side. Thus, a weight estimate of around 130 grams is plausible and consistent with visible volume and density."

The food item 'chips vaya beans' appears as a pile of thin, dry chips on a small to medium-sized dessert or salad plate (approximate diameter around 20-22 cm). Each chip looks thin and light, resembling a puffed or baked bean chip rather than a dense potato chip. Given the pile size, it covers roughly a circular area of about 12-15 cm diameter on the plate, piled moderately. Chips of this type are airy and have a low density, with typical weights around 0.5-0.7 g per large chip, with some broken pieces included. Estimating about 20-25 chips in this portion based on visual count and pile volume, this results in roughly 12-17 grams. Considering visual airy texture and typical light weight, an estimate near the middle, around 15 g, is reasonable. This is consistent with snack-sized portions seen in Swiss or European household servings."
ppf8hc,salade de pâtes,73.0,120,47.0,0.4071437047585143,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/7e81c5ce-4e03-49fb-93d4-0aca33571c65,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'salade de pâtes'. Visually, this pasta salad portion on the plate is roughly a small pile occupying about a quarter of the plate's inner area. The plate diameter is likely around 26 cm, so the pasta salad covers a base area on the plate of roughly 8-9 cm diameter. The salad consists of medium-sized cooked pasta spirals, mixed with some vegetables such as tomato, corn, and pepper pieces. Cooked pasta is dense, and typical serving sizes range around 100-150 grams for a moderate portion. This portion looks moderate to slightly small, more than a small side but less than a large serving. Given the density and volume observed, an approximate weight of 120 grams for the pasta salad is reasonable, fitting typical Swiss serving sizes and visual assessment compared to the other foods on the plate. The portion does not look heaped or overflowed, thus no upward adjustment is needed. Therefore, the estimated weight of 'salade de pâtes' is 120 grams."

The image shows a single apple that is relatively small in size, with some minor surface blemishes typical of real fruit but no unusual swelling or unusual size indications. Considering typical Swiss average weights for apples, medium apples weigh between 150-180 g and large apples between 180-220 g. This apple appears smaller and more compact rather than large or medium, closer in size to a smaller apple variety. Given these visual size cues and the absence of other items for direct size comparison, it is reasonable to estimate this apple at the lower end of medium apple weights. Thus, an estimated weight around 140 grams is appropriate as a slightly below-average sized apple. This fits the typical range and visually matches the size in the image without overestimation."

The galettes millet haricots noirs maïs are clearly identifiable as three patties composed of millet, black beans, and corn. They occupy roughly one-third of the bowl's surface area. The bowl diameter seems to be a standard small to medium bowl, approximately 17 to 20 cm in diameter, judging by the visible hand holding the bowl and typical kitchen context. Each galette appears thick and dense, approximately 1.5 to 2 cm thick. Given the ingredients (millet, black beans, corn), the density should be moderate, similar to cooked grain and legume mixtures, estimated at about 0.8 to 1.0 g/cm³. Estimating the total volume: each galette roughly 7 cm in diameter (slightly irregular shape) and 1.5 cm thick, that gives a volume of about 58 cm³ per galette, times 3 = 174 cm³ total. Multiplying volume by 0.9 g/cm³ density gives approximately 156 g total weight of the galettes in the bowl. Checking for plausibility: millet and beans cooked together usually yield a compact patty, so around 50 g each is reasonable, summing to 150-160 g total, which fits well. Therefore, the estimated weight for galettes millet haricots noirs maïs is 156 grams."

The image shows a small piece of pizza on a plate approximately 26 cm in diameter. The pizza slice is much smaller than a typical 1/8th slice of a 30 cm whole pizza. The visible pizza piece here looks like roughly 1/4 of a 1/8th slice (so about 1/32 of a whole pizza). A whole 30 cm pizza weighs approximately 450-550 g. Taking the average weight of 500 g, dividing by 8 slices gives about 62.5 g per slice, and dividing further by 4 (since the piece is about one quarter of a slice) yields approximately 15-16 g. The slice contains mushrooms and sauce, which are fairly light but slightly adds volume and weight, so the estimate is reasonable within Swiss reference ranges. Therefore, the pizza piece weighs roughly 15 grams."

The specified food item is 'poulet' (chicken). Visually, the chicken piece appears to be a cooked chicken breast portion, likely boneless and skinless, covered in some sauce or gravy, which adds no significant weight but moistens the surface. The size of the piece can be compared relative to the fries and salad on the plate, and the plate itself (usually around 26-28 cm in diameter). The chicken piece spans about one-quarter of the plate area with thickness consistent with a medium chicken breast. A typical cooked chicken breast in Switzerland weighs about 120-150 grams. Given the visible size and thickness that does not look large or small, a middle-range estimate near 140 grams is reasonable. Cross-checking, cooked chicken breast pieces served in meals often range from 120 to 160 grams for a single serving, and this piece does not appear unusually thin or thick to deviate significantly from that. Therefore, the weight estimate of 140 grams is realistic and fits the visual scale and Swiss portion norms."

The avocado (avocat) is sliced and placed visibly in three distinct segments on a wrap that is about the size of a standard galette wrap (~22-25 cm diameter). The slices are relatively thick and show typical avocado size. A whole medium avocado usually weighs around 150-200 g including the pit and skin, but the edible portion is roughly 70-80% of that. Given the slices shown, this represents about half of a medium avocado. Using typical Swiss avocado sizes and standard slicing, the avocado portion visible is approximately 70-80 g. Considering the density and thickness of the slices, and comparing them with other elements (like the slice of ham and grated cheese), the estimate fits well within typical portion sizes for a half avocado."

The specified food item is 'pain' (bread). In the image, there are three slices of rustic bread on a plate, each about 1.5 cm thick with a typical density for a country-style wheat bread. The slices appear to be approximately 10 cm long and 6-7 cm wide. A typical slice of similar Swiss bread weighs about 35 to 45 grams per slice depending on thickness. Given these slices are moderately thick and relatively dense, I estimate about 40 grams per slice. There are three full slices, so total bread weight equals 3 × 40 = 120 grams. No visible crust chunk or bread fragments are significant enough to adjust the estimate notably. I exclude beurre and confiture fraise as per instructions."

The specified food item is 'oeufs brouillés' (scrambled eggs). Visually, the scrambled eggs occupy nearly one-third of a standard dinner plate of about 26 cm diameter. The eggs have a fluffy texture but also some density. A typical scrambled egg portion made from 2 large eggs weighs roughly 100-120 g cooked. The volume on the plate looks consistent with about 2 large eggs worth of scrambled eggs. The eggs cover a compact area without extreme flattening or spreading. Considering that, an estimate near 110 g is reasonable for this portion. This fits well within typical Swiss portion sizes and is consistent with the appearance and scale in the image, especially relative to the other food items (gnocchi and cauliflower) for spatial reference."

The image shows a plastic container with diced vegetables typical of a Greek salad: cucumber, yellow and red bell pepper, onion rings, olives, and small cubes of white cheese (likely feta). The container size looks like a common takeaway salad box approximately 12 cm wide, 8 cm deep, and 7 cm tall. The salad appears to be about two-thirds full, with diced ingredients spread evenly. Greek salad ingredients are mostly low density, with water content and air spaces. Feta cheese adds some density. Given the container size and fill level, the volume of the salad is roughly around 500 ml. Greek salad density can be approximated around 0.7 g/ml because of watery vegetables and cheese. Multiplying 500 ml by 0.7 g/ml gives approximately 350 g. This fits typical portion sizes for a Greek salad serving. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'salade grecque' in this container is about 350 grams."

The specified food is 'oeufs' (eggs). There is one fried egg visible on top of the plate with pasta and ketchup. The egg appears to be a whole large egg, fried with a mostly runny yolk. Considering a typical large Swiss egg weighs about 60-65 grams when raw. Cooking reduces some water weight but not drastically. Fried eggs typically weigh around 50-60 grams. Given the whole egg is visible and fairly standard in size, I estimate the egg weight at about 55 grams. The ketchup and pasta do not affect this weight estimate. This is consistent with typical Swiss large eggs and the visual scale of the plate and fork next to it."

The specified food item is 'salade verte,' which is the green salad visible on the plate near the bottom right area. The salade verte consists mainly of leafy lettuce with some dressing mixed in. The portion covers roughly a quarter of the plate section area. Considering the plate appears to be a standard dining plate (~26-28 cm diameter), the salad portion is about 150-180 cm² in area. Leafy green salad has low density, roughly 0.2-0.3 g/cm³. Its visible depth looks shallow, about 1.5-2 cm thick, so the effective volume is roughly 150 cm² × 1.5 cm = 225 cm³. Multiplying by the density, 225 cm³ × 0.25 g/cm³ gives about 56 grams. This is plausible for a modest side salad portion on a plate. Comparing with typical serving sizes of leafy salad with dressing, around 50-70 grams is normal. Therefore, the estimate is about 55 grams."

The specified food item is 'raviolis a la courge'. In the image, there are about 7 visible raviolis arranged on a small square plate. Each ravioli looks like a standard size, roughly 5 cm by 5 cm. Typical filled ravioli weigh about 20-30 grams each, especially when filled with something dense like pumpkin (courge). Given the count of about 7 raviolis and assuming an average weight of approximately 25 grams per ravioli, the total weight is around 7 * 25 = 175 grams. The raviolis are cooked, evidenced by their texture and presence of pepper on top, so this weight estimate includes the water content after cooking. There does not appear to be any significant portion missing or hidden. This estimate fits within typical portion sizes for a meal in Switzerland."
r3bub9,tomate,50.0,80,30.0,0.17799928800284798,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/r3bub9/dish_media/bb18e23e-6449-46ba-a82b-2f630af251aa,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'tomate' (tomato). The tomatoes are sliced and placed roughly in the middle of a rectangular container. The container appears to be a typical takeaway box about 15 cm long and 10 cm wide, based on visible texture and relative size. The tomato slices form a layer covering about 60% of the container's base area. Each slice appears thin (around 5 mm thick) and there seem to be about 5 to 6 slices arranged overlapping somewhat. A medium tomato in Switzerland usually weighs around 150-200 g, and a sliced tomato used as a portion for a meal commonly corresponds to about half a medium tomato or slightly more. Visual estimation suggests there is about half the volume and mass of one medium tomato here. This leads to an estimated weight of roughly 80 g for the tomato portion. This fits well within a plausible range for the sliced portion visible in the container, neither too little nor overly large, when compared with typical tomato weights and the container size."

The specified food item is 'épautre cuit' (cooked spelt). The cooked spelt is located on the left side of the glass container. It occupies roughly one-third of the container's volume. The container appears to be a typical rectangular glass meal prep container approximately 15 cm square and about 5 cm deep. Since the spelt grains are plump and packed moderately, the volume for the spelt is about 1/3 of the container. A full meal prep container of this size holds roughly 500-600 grams of food depending on density. Cooked grains like spelt are quite dense - approximately 130-150 g per cooked cup (about 240 ml). Visually, the spelt fills about 1/3 of the container's base and about 80% of the depth, estimating roughly 300-350 ml volume. Using 140 g per 240 ml as a density, this gives approximately (350/240)*140 ≈ 204 grams. To be conservative, rounding slightly downward for some air gaps gives an estimated weight close to 190 grams of cooked spelt in this container. This fits plausible portion size range for a side of cooked spelt in a meal. Cross-checking with visual scale: container size and portion relative to scrambled eggs and aubergine also support this estimate."

The specified food item is 'galette millet maïs haricots noirs'. In the image, two small patties are visible in a transparent container alongside a beetroot and carrot salad and two pieces of soft cheese. The container looks like a typical food storage box, and the patties are about 5-6 cm in diameter and roughly 1-1.5 cm thick. Millet, corn, and black bean patties typically have a density similar to cooked grains and legumes, which can be approximated to about 0.8-1.0 g/cm³. Given their size and thickness, each patty's volume is roughly a cylinder: volume ≈ π × (radius)^2 × height. Radius is about 2.5-3 cm, height about 1.2 cm on average. Volume ≈ 3.14 × 2.75^2 × 1.2 ≈ 28.6 cm³ per patty. For two patties, about 57 cm³ total. Applying the density, 0.9 g/cm³ × 57 cm³ ≈ 51 g total for both patties. Visually, this seems consistent with size relative to the other foods present. Considering slight variation in thickness or density, a rounded estimate of 50 grams is appropriate."

The image shows a single waffle on a plate, approximately rectangular with a grid pattern typical of waffles. The waffle size relative to the plate suggests it is a small-to-medium homemade or café-style waffle, likely around 10x15 cm. A waffle of this size generally weighs between 60-90 grams, depending on density. The waffle looks fairly thick, with a firm, baked crust visible around the edges and air pockets inside the grid. Wheat-based waffles of this size and thickness typically weigh about 75 grams. Therefore, the estimated weight of the waffle (gaufre) is 75 grams."

Rustic bread has a density approximately 0.3-0.4 g/cm³ due to the airy crumb. Estimating volume per slice: 8 cm × 6 cm × 2 cm = 96 cm³. Using average density 0.35 g/cm³ gives about 33.6 g per slice. There are two slices, but the right slice is roughly half missing due to bite, so roughly one and a half slices total. Calculated weight: 33.6 g × 1.5 = ~50 g.

The image shows one slice of tarte à la rhubarbe on a white plate approximately 26 cm in diameter, with a knife and fork for scale. The slice visually represents about 1/8 of a whole round tart. A typical Swiss rhubarb tart is about 24-26 cm in diameter and usually weighs around 600-700 grams whole. The slice is of average thickness, and the topping rhubarb pieces are dense but not excessively thick, typical of a custard tart base with rhubarb pieces embedded. Given these considerations, the slice likely weighs about 1/8 of the whole tart weight: 600-700 g divided by 8 is about 75-87.5 g. To be conservative and account for some visible crust and filling proportion, 80 grams is a reasonable estimate."

The specified food item is 'séré maigre,' which is a type of low-fat fresh cheese, visible as the creamy base mixed with chia seeds and hazelnut purée inside a small bowl. The bowl seems relatively small, approximately the size of a small dessert or snack bowl, likely around 12 cm in diameter judging by relative size of the spoon and the woven placemat underneath. The portion fills roughly 3/4 of the bowl's volume. Such a bowl typically holds around 100-150 grams of dairy snack substances. The texture is thick but not very dense, similar to yogurt or fromage blanc. Considering the mixture with chia seeds and nut purée, the density might be slightly increased but overall close to dairy. Given the visible volume, a reasonable estimate for the weight of the 'séré maigre' portion is around 120 grams. This fits typical snack serving sizes and the observed volume in the bowl. Hence, the estimated weight of 'séré maigre' seen in the image is about 120 grams."

The specified food item is 'poivron' (bell pepper), visible as sliced red pieces on the plate. The slices cover a small area, roughly 10 cm by 4 cm, and they appear moderately cooked or sautéed, which does not change their weight but confirms density similar to raw bell pepper slices. Typically, bell peppers have a density close to water, around 1 g/cm³. Given the volume of the slices, estimating thickness at about 0.5 cm on average across the slices. So, volume is approximately 10 cm × 4 cm × 0.5 cm = 20 cm³, i.e., about 20 grams. The size and amount seem consistent with about one medium small sliced pepper portion used for one wrap. This is a plausible estimate staying within typical Swiss portion size. Thus, the weight estimate for the poivron is about 20 grams."

First, I locate the 'tomates' in the image: there are three visible tomato slices placed on the avocado and under the shredded carrots. Each slice appears to be about 2-3 cm thick and about 4-5 cm long. Tomato slices from fresh tomatoes typically weigh about 10-15 grams each due to their water content and density. Here, the three slices together look like approximately one medium-sized tomato represented as slices spread out on the wrap. A medium Swiss tomato weighs about 120-150 g whole, but given these are only three slices, it is likely about a third to half of a tomato, yielding 40-70 grams. Considering the size and the fact that the tomato looks fresh and juicy, I estimate the total tomato weight here to be around 50 grams as a balanced estimate. The plate and other items give a scale reference of about 26 cm for the plate diameter, and the tomato slices are consistent with this scale. Thus, 50 grams is reasonable and fits typical portion sizes for this tomato amount in a wrap."

The crackers are stacked directly, without visible additional spread or topping, so the total weight estimate can be obtained by multiplying the number of crackers (4) by the average single cracker weight (~10 g). This yields approximately 40 grams total. The crackers appear to be standard size Blevita with no visible modifications or partial pieces, supporting this straightforward calculation."

The specified food item is 'salade'. The salad is on the left side of a standard-sized plate, approximately 26 cm in diameter. The salad is comprised mainly of leafy greens (likely lettuce) with some visible sunflower seeds. The volume of the salad is about one-third of the plate area, but as leafy greens are very light and airy, the weight is low relative to its volume. Given the amount of visible leaves and the few seeds, the salad likely weighs around 40-60 grams. Considering the visible portion and typical density of fresh leafy salad, a reasonable estimate is about 50 grams."

The container is a metal lunch box approximately the size of a typical meal container, likely about 1 liter volume. The vinaigrette is visible as a light drizzle or small amount on top of the tofu and other salad ingredients. There is no separate container for the vinaigrette; the quantity seen is a thin coating or drizzle mainly on tofu and some vegetables. This is not a fully loaded bowl with sauce but rather a light amount. A heaped teaspoon of nut-butter or similar dense spreads is about 10-15 g; vinaigrette, being mostly liquid oil and vinegar, is less dense and usually thinner in volume for flavoring, so a typical drizzle would weigh less. Visually, this is about 1-2 teaspoons worth of dressing scattered across the top. Given this visual and common serving sizes, a reasonable estimate would be around 10 grams total for the visible vinaigrette amount."

The specified food item is 'épinards frais' (fresh spinach). In the image, fresh spinach leaves are spread out in the bowl beneath other items. The bowl is a medium size, likely around 18-20 cm across visible inside. The spinach leaves cover the bottom and some portions overlap, but the pile is not heaped—it's relatively flat with some small layering. Fresh spinach is very light and has a low density. A typical serving size for fresh spinach leaves in a salad bowl like this is approximately 30-40 grams for a volume coverage like this. Considering the leaves' spread and thickness (mainly single-layer with some small overlapping), the spinach portion looks to be about 35 grams. This aligns well with typical Swiss serving sizes for fresh spinach in salads and is plausible considering the other portion sizes and bowl scale."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,400,17.0,0.8412246351014596,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The food item to estimate is 'salade de tomates'. Visually, this is a plate of sliced fresh tomatoes with some seasoning (huile d'olive, vinaigre balsamique, graines de lin). The plate is a standard dinner plate of about 26 cm diameter, which gives scale. The tomato slices cover most of the plate center but are in a single layer and relatively flat, indicating volume is mostly in the flat cut slices rather than stacked. The tomato slices seem to come from 2 or 3 medium tomatoes based on size and number of slices visible (approx 20 tomato slices). Typical medium Swiss tomatoes weigh around 150-180 g each. Assuming 2.5 tomatoes at about 160 g each gives about 400 g raw tomatoes. Since these are fresh sliced tomatoes without heavy cooking weight loss, the salad weight can be approximated close to the raw weight. The added olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and lin seeds add negligible weight compared to the tomato volume. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'salade de tomates' on the plate is around 400 grams. Double-checking with the size of tomato slices and plate scale confirms this is plausible; it fits a normal salad serving portion."

The specified food item is 'sauce bolognese'. Visually, the sauce is spread on top of a serving of cooked spaghetti on a plate approximately 26 cm in diameter. The sauce covers a central area of about half the plate's diameter in length and roughly 1/3 the width of the plate in breadth. The sauce layer appears relatively dense but thin, with no visible large chunks. Typical home-cooked Bolognese sauce servings on pasta ranges typically from about 80 g to 150 g depending on portion size. Given the plate size, volume of sauce visible, and comparing to the volume of pasta under it, this portion appears moderate—neither very light nor heaped. Therefore, a realistic estimate would be approximately 120 grams of sauce bolognese on the plate. This fits typical Swiss portion sizes and the visual coverage and density of the sauce relative to the pasta and plate."

The specified food is 'tartine mélasse + beurre,' which is the slice of bread at the bottom of the plate. It appears to be a rustic slice of bread approximately 12 cm long and 5-6 cm wide. Since bread density for rustic sourdough-type bread is roughly 0.3 to 0.4 g/cm³, and thickness is about 2-2.5 cm, the slice volume is roughly 12 cm x 6 cm x 2 cm = 144 cm³, so the bread weight is approximately 40-55 g. The butter layer looks light but spread evenly, estimated about 5 g. The molasses spread is a thin glossy layer, likely about 5 g. Total estimated weight: bread 45 g + butter 5 g + molasses 5 g = about 55 g. Given some variability, a final estimate of 55 g is reasonable for the whole tartine with toppings."

The specified food item is 'beurre' (butter). There are 4 slices of bread on the plate, each spread with a layer of butter underneath the strawberry jam (confiture fraise). The slices appear to be standard slices of whole wheat or similar bread, around 10-12 cm in length. The amount of butter spread on each slice is moderate and visibly thinly spread but covering most of the surface area. For a thin to moderate spread, a realistic butter quantity per slice would be about 5 grams. For 4 slices, total butter would then be about 20 grams. This estimation fits typical portion sizes and visual thickness of the spread on the bread, considering typical butter density and the typical Swiss butter application on bread. Thus, the weight of the 'beurre' on the plate is estimated at 20 grams."

The salami slices are placed on the right side of the plate. They appear to be about 6 slices, each roughly 2 to 3 cm in diameter and about 2 mm thick. A typical thin slice of Swiss salami weighs around 5 grams each. Given their size and typical density, 6 slices would weigh approximately 30 grams. Considering that some slices are partially broken and slightly uneven, an estimate of about 28 to 32 grams is reasonable. Therefore, the estimated weight of the salami is about 30 grams. This matches well with common packaging and serving sizes for salami slices in Switzerland."

The food item ""branche de chocolat"" is visually identified in the image as a chocolate bar with a rough texture, likely containing nuts or crisped rice. The chocolate is handheld, giving us a reference for size. The visible portion appears to be a typical mobile chocolate snack bar, about the length and width of a finger, roughly 10 cm long and 2-3 cm wide. The thickness looks about 1-1.5 cm, consistent with a dense chocolate bar. Given typical Swiss chocolate snack bars of this size, the weight ranges usually between 30 to 50 grams. Considering the visible dimensions, density from chocolate and inclusions, and proportion of the bar shown, an estimate of around 40 grams is reasonable. This fits with known Swiss chocolates of similar size and packaging. Therefore, the estimated weight is 40 g."

The specified food item is 'framboises' (raspberries). In the image, there are about 7 visible raspberries on the plate. Swiss average weight per raspberry is about 3-4 grams. Raspberries are fairly light, and these are of average size compared to the strawberries and bread slice visible. There's no container but just a small handful visible. Assuming 7 raspberries × approximately 3.5 g each gives an estimated weight of about 24.5 g. Raspberries have an airy structure, so this estimate is plausible within typical Swiss fruit portion sizes."

The specified food item is mozzarella, which in this image appears as a small dollop on top of the pasta. Comparing its size to the pasta spirals and the beans nearby, the mozzarella portion looks roughly like a small scoop or spoonful. Typical fresh mozzarella portions for such servings usually range between 30 and 50 grams, depending on density and moisture content. Given the volume observed, the mozzarella here is likely about 40 grams. This aligns well with Swiss typical fresh mozzarella snack portions and fits the visual scale on the plate without overestimating the mass relative to the other items."

The specified food item is the salad, which consists of green salad leaves, carrot strips, avocado pieces, and dressing (olive oil and vinegar). By visual estimation, the salad occupies about half the plate (a standard plate has ~26 cm diameter). The lettuce leaves are loosely packed, which means low density. The carrot strips add some density, and the avocado pieces notably increase weight since avocado is dense and fatty. The visible amount of avocado seems to be about 2-3 small slices. Typical salad portion with such ingredients would weigh between 120-180 g for this volume. Considering the ingredients, avocado weight, and dressing, 150 g is a balanced estimate. The dressing (1 tablespoon olive oil + 1 tablespoon vinegar) adds some weight but remains minor overall. Therefore, 150 g is a reasonable estimate for the salad portion visible."

The specified food item is 'demi croissant'. The croissant piece shown is half of a typical croissant. A standard butter croissant in Switzerland weighs approximately 45-60 g. Since this is roughly half a croissant, the weight should be about half of that range, so around 22-30 g. The croissant in the image looks like a standard size, and the small piece remaining confirms it's about a half portion. Therefore, an estimate close to the midpoint of the half range, about 26 g, is reasonable for this demi croissant. The bread itself is the majority of the weight; butter and jam might add a minimal amount, but since the task specifies only the demi croissant, we exclude toppings. This fits well within typical Swiss croissant weights and visual volume."

The item is a 'branche de chocolat', which visually resembles a chocolate-covered crunchy stick or nugget-like bar. From the image, the length of the chocolate branch is approximately 10 cm, and the shape is cylindrical but irregular due to the textured coating. The thickness is about 2.5 cm in diameter. Comparing it to common chocolate snack sticks available in Switzerland, such items usually weigh between 30 to 50 grams depending on size and density. Considering the visible thickness (not a very thin crisp stick) and texture (likely including some form of puffed cereal or nuts embedded in chocolate), a weight around 40 grams seems plausible. This is consistent with typical Swiss chocolate snack portions, and the size relative to the wood surface (assuming a usual table) aligns with this estimation. Therefore, the estimated weight for this single chocolate stick is 40 grams."

The specified food item is ""légumes (courgette, oignon, 1 cs d'huile d'olive)"". Visually, the vegetables occupy roughly a third of the plate on the left side. The plate appears to be about standard size (~26 cm diameter), which provides scale. The vegetables are sliced courgette and onion pieces, sautéed with about 1 tablespoon of olive oil (roughly 10-15 g oil). The vegetable portion appears to be a moderate serving rather than a large heap. Considering typical cooked vegetable density and volume, this serving looks like approximately 150-200 grams total combined vegetables with oil. Given the density and the visible volume, an estimate toward the lower side is reasonable. Olive oil adds minimal volume but contributes some weight, so including it is necessary. Therefore, the vegetables plus the oil is estimated at about 170 grams in total."

The specified food item is 'pousses de graines' (sprouts). Observing the image, the sprouts are scattered mainly in the middle-left portion of the bowl, roughly covering an area of about 8-10 cm by 6-7 cm, with some depth but relatively thin layer. The sprouts appear fresh, slightly packed but not dense. Visually they seem like mung bean or sunflower sprouts, which have low density. There is no container or packaging visible around them, so estimation must rely on volume and typical density. Using the plate (or bowl) size as reference, this bowl is about 18-20 cm across. The sprouts volume corresponds roughly to a small handful, approximately 1 to 1.5 cups in volume (about 150-200 ml). Since raw sprouts have a density around 0.2 to 0.3 g/ml, multiplying 170 ml (average) by 0.25 g/ml would give about 40-45 g. Given some leafy spinach leaves mixed in and the lightness of sprouts, the weight is estimated lower than denser vegetables. Cross-checking typical portions, a serving of sprouts for salad is often about 30-50 g. Therefore, a good estimate for the sprouts visible here is around 40 g."

The specified food item is 'maréchal,' which refers to small pieces of cheese visible on the plate. There are about 5 small cheese cubes, each approximately 2 cm in size. Swiss semi-hard cheese cubes typically weigh around 15-20 g per 30-40 mm cube, so a 20 mm cube would weigh roughly 5 g. With 5 cubes present, the total weight is approximately 5 g x 5 = 25 g. The cheese cubes are small and compact, and the estimation aligns with typical cheese density and size. Therefore, 25 g is a reasonable estimate for this quantity of 'maréchal'."

The specified food item 'pain/galette' appears to be a type of flatbread or wrap, partially rolled and placed inside a metal tray. Based on visual clues, the bread is roughly the size of a medium wrap, approximately 20-25 cm in length, and fairly thin. This type of flatbread typically weighs less than a dense bread loaf because it is thin and pliable. Considering the visible portion (most of the galette seems present, with some folding), the density is low, typical for thin flatbreads. A wrap or galette of this size in Switzerland would usually weigh between 60-90 grams. Since the wrap appears to be substantial but not overly thick or heavy, an estimate near the mid-range around 80 grams is plausible. The size can be compared with the standard metal tray width approximately 20 cm, confirming the scale. Thus, estimating 80 grams for this ‘pain/galette’ is reasonable and consistent with typical Swiss flatbread weights."

The specified food item to estimate is 'myrtilles' (blueberries). Visually, there are approximately 14 visible blueberries on the plate. Blueberries typically weigh between 1 to 2 grams each in Switzerland. Given their size and appearance here, using an average weight of about 1.5 grams per blueberry is reasonable. There is no evident layering or hidden depth, as all blueberries are clearly visible in a single layer. Therefore, the total weight of the blueberries can be estimated by multiplying the count (14) by the average weight (1.5 g), which gives 21 grams. This estimate aligns well with typical Swiss retail measures and the visual portion size, neither overestimating nor underestimating the likely weight."

According to Swiss typical weights, a cooked chicken drumette weighs about 25-35 grams each. These drumettes appear to be standard size and are fully cooked with some charring visible. There is no indication that any of these are missing bone or unusually large or small. Multiplying the average weight of one drumette (about 30 g as a midpoint) by the four drumettes gives us about 120 g. This estimate fits within expected typical portion sizes for this amount of chicken drumettes and aligns with visual size relative to the plate and other food items. Hence, the most defensible figure is about 120 grams for the four drumettes visible here."

The slice size seems about standard, approximately 10-12 cm wide and about 1.5 cm thick. Butter has a relatively high density, roughly 0.9 g/cm³. The spread appears thin, likely less than 2 mm thick, covering most of the slice surface. Estimating the surface area at about 80 cm² (roughly 10 cm x 8 cm portion) and thickness about 1.5 mm (0.15 cm), gives a volume of about 12 cm³ (80 x 0.15). Multiplying by butter density 0.9 g/cm³ results in about 11 g butter. Considering small unevenness and that the butter is spread very thinly and not thickly heaped, an estimate of around 8-11 g seems reasonable.

Typical cooked pasta servings in Switzerland are about 120-140 g per 180 ml (Swiss cup measure). Visually, this amount corresponds roughly to a rounded half cup to two-thirds cup of cooked pasta volume. Comparing to the other items on the plate: the green beans and red kidney beans have typical volumes and serve as reference for portion size. The pasta portion is substantial but not overly large; it is likely around 130 grams. This falls within typical Swiss serving sizes, plausible for one meal portion.

Bread has a relatively low density around 0.25-0.35 g/cm³. The slice is full, no visible missing parts or thin slices. Typical Swiss bread slices weigh between 30 and 50 grams depending on thickness and density. Given the moderate thickness and size of the slice, it likely weighs around 40 grams.

Given the standard portion size of butter pats in Switzerland and typical weights for a butter portion served with bread at meals, the pats usually weigh about 5-10 grams each. This piece looks slightly larger than a single pat, roughly 10-12 grams. The size is confirmed relative to the petits pains and slices of meat, which are standard portion sizes. Considering the density and common size of a butter portion, an estimate of 12 grams is defensible here. This fits well within typical Swiss portion sizes for butter served with bread."

The specified food item is 'hummous', located at the lower left part of the plate. It appears as a spread or dip, roughly scoop-sized. Considering the plate size (~26 cm diameter) and comparing the hummous portion to other items, the hummous mound is about the size of a heaped tablespoon or small spoonful. A heaped teaspoon of hummous is about 10-15 g, so a heaped tablespoon could reasonably be about 30-40 g. The hummous here is shaped like a small scoop, slightly larger than a tablespoon but not by much. Accounting for density and visible volume, the best estimate is about 35 g of hummous. This fits Swiss typical portion sizes for such a dish and matches the visual scale on the plate next to cottage cheese and other items."

The specified food item is 'pain', which is a piece of bread with caviar d'aubergines spread on top. The bread slice is rustic, about 10-12 cm long and roughly 5-6 cm wide, with a medium thickness. Given that bread density for such rustic bread is approximately 0.25 to 0.3 g/cm³ and the slice seems to be of moderate thickness (about 2.5 to 3 cm thick), the volume of bread is roughly estimated as length × width × height = 11 cm × 5.5 cm × 2.8 cm = about 170 cm³. Multiplying by density at about 0.27 g/cm³ gives approximately 45 grams. This fits well with typical slice weights for rustic bread sizes eaten in Switzerland. The topping weight is excluded as instructed."

The specified food item is 'toast'. In the image, there are two slices of toasted bread spread with a thin layer of fromage frais. The slices appear to be standard pre-sliced bread, roughly square, about 10 cm per side, typical for Swiss packaged sliced bread. A normal slice of toast bread weighs about 30 grams. The two slices together would weigh about 60 grams. The fromage frais spread is light and thin, so its weight contribution is minimal and should not be included as per instructions. Therefore, the weight of the 'toast' is estimated as 60 grams."

The image shows several pieces of cut pear ('poire') in a small plastic container. We can estimate that these pieces come from about one medium pear based on typical Swiss size, as the pieces collectively fill the container but do not overflow it. A medium Swiss pear usually weighs around 160-200 grams. Considering some peeling loss and the fact that the pieces appear to be from most of the pear, the total edible weight is approximately equal to one whole medium pear. The container size and pieces all appear consistent with this range, without excess or missing large amounts. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the weight of these pear pieces is around 170 grams."

The specified food item is 'muesli nature,' which is shown in a small orange bowl on the right side of the image. The bowl appears to be a small standard serving bowl approximately 10 cm in diameter. The muesli is in large clusters, which are airy and not densely packed. Considering the volume of the bowl and the visible amount of clumped muesli, along with typical muesli cluster density (~0.3 g/cm³), the visible portion likely weighs between 45 and 65 grams. Given the amount filling the bowl moderately heaped, a mid to upper estimate close to 60 grams is reasonable. This fits typical Swiss portion sizes for muesli served with yogurt. The other item, 'yaourt nature,' is not included in this estimate. Therefore, the final estimate for the muesli weight is 60 grams."

The salade de céleri is the small pile of grated white celery root salad at the bottom right of the plate. It is a shredded, compact mound, roughly the size of the carrot salad to its top right, but slightly smaller. The plate appears standard, about 26 cm wide, judging by the cutlery and the glass rim partially visible. The celery salad mound measures roughly 6-7 cm in diameter and about 2-3 cm thick. Celery root salad is dense but watery, similar in density to other raw shredded root vegetables, roughly 0.6-0.7 g/cm³. Estimating the volume as roughly a cylinder: volume ≈ π × (3 cm)² × 2.5 cm = about 70 cm³. At 0.65 g/cm³ density, this equals approximately 45 grams. This is plausible for a side salad portion on a plate. The estimate is consistent with common serving sizes of celery root salads in Swiss home or restaurant meals."

The image shows a slice of bread with spread on top, placed on a white plate. The specified food item is ""pain"" (bread). The slice looks like a typical white or sandwich bread slice, about 10-12 cm in length and roughly triangular. Given the standard serving size of a slice of white bread in Switzerland is around 30-40 grams. The slice is about half of a round bread roll cut in half, which is consistent with typical weights for this type of bread. There are no visible signs indicating that this is a very thick or unusually dense bread, and no crumbs or excess thickness visible to increase the estimate. Therefore, the weight of the bread slice (pain) alone should be estimated as around 35 grams, which is plausible for such a piece and consistent with Swiss portions. The weight does not include the butter or pâte à tartiner spreads."

The specified food item to estimate is 'graines de chia' (chia seeds). In the image, the chia seeds are mixed throughout the white creamy mixture (blanc battu) with oats and drizzled honey. Chia seeds are small and dense, typically about 1 gram per teaspoon (approximately 5 grams per tablespoon). Visually, the chia seeds appear distributed evenly in the bowl, but the total amount looks like about 1 to 1.5 teaspoons worth of seeds mixed in the total volume, based on visible density of seeds in the mixture. Since the bowl's content is about a moderate serving size, the chia seeds content is likely between 4 and 6 grams. Evaluating the spread and concentration, about 5 grams of chia seeds is a reasonable and defensible estimate."

The salade portion on the plate is relatively small, made primarily of loose leafy green lettuce with some visible dressing and possibly small bits of other vegetables or seeds. The plate is approximately 26 cm in diameter, based on standard dinnerware assumptions, which helps scale the size of the salad. The salad occupies a small portion of the plate, roughly 7 cm by 4 cm area, and it appears to be fairly thin and lightly packed with some volume but not dense. Considering the leafy nature and light dressing, the density is low, roughly 0.15-0.25 g/cm³. Estimating the volume as approximately 7x4x2 cm = 56 cm³ and applying the density range, the weight is around 8-14 grams. Given the visible amount and light nature of the salad, the best estimate is about 12 grams."

The specified food item is 'crème de marrons', which is the chestnut cream spread visible on the piece of bread. The piece of bread is a small torn section, roughly 7-8 cm long and around 3-4 cm wide, with some thickness. The crème de marrons is spread moderately thick on the bread. Considering typical thickness of a spread on bread, about 3-4 mm, this corresponds to a volume roughly 7 cm × 4 cm × 0.3-0.4 cm = 8.4-11.2 cm³. The density of crème de marrons (a sweet, thick puree) is close to that of water or slightly higher, so around 1 g/cm³. Therefore the weight of the crème de marrons can be approximated as about 8 to 11 grams. Cross-checking with typical portion sizes of spreads on small bread pieces supports this estimate, and the visible amount is moderate, not heaped, so 10 grams is a reasonable estimate."

The specified food item is 'carottes' (carrots). In the image, the carrots are visible as thin slices mixed with other vegetables and pasta inside a standard white bowl. The bowl appears to be about 20 cm in diameter, somewhat deep, and contains a mix of pasta, aubergines, carrots, and a creamy cheese sauce. The carrots are cut into thin rounds and strips, scattered throughout the dish, and seem to make up roughly 10-15% of the total food volume. Given the other components, cooked carrots' density is similar to cooked vegetables, roughly 0.8-1.0 g/cm³. The total bowl contents would reasonably weigh about 300-350 grams based on volume and typical portion sizes for pasta dishes. Estimating the carrots as about 1/8 to 1/10 of this total (due to visible proportions), I infer the carrot portion weighs approximately 35 grams. This is plausible given the visible thin carrot slices scattered and the typical weight of similar cooked vegetable portions in Swiss servings. Thus, the estimated weight of the carrots 'carottes' is 35 grams."

The specified food 'graine de chia' is visible as small black seeds distributed within the jar contents. The jar contains a mixture of yogourt nature, flocons d'avoine, son d'avoine, miel, graine de chia, and purée d'amande. The chia seeds are dispersed throughout and seem not to be forming a thick layer but are mixed evenly. The jar appears to be about a 250-300 ml small glass jar. Given that the chia seeds are a minor ingredient by volume compared to the yogurt and oats and typically used in modest quantities. The volume of chia seeds visible corresponds to approximately 1-2 tablespoons (around 12-15 ml) in volume. Considering the density of chia seeds, about 0.6 g/ml, this equates to roughly 7-9 grams. Since some seeds may be less visible beneath the surface, estimate towards the upper side. Thus, about 8 grams of chia seeds is a plausible estimation based on visual cues and typical portion sizes in such a mixture."

The specified food is 'beurre' (butter) spread on a slice of bread. From the image, the butter layer on the bread is thin and covers roughly half to two thirds of the slice's surface. The bread slice appears to be a medium slice from a rustic loaf, typically weighing about 40-50 g. The butter layer thickness looks moderate but not heaped. A thin spread of butter on bread is commonly around 5 to 10 grams. Considering the spread is not very thick but covers a notable fraction of the slice, a reasonable estimate is about 7 grams of butter. This is consistent with typical light to moderate spreading on bread and fits a realistic portion size. The weight of the bread itself or the jam/nutella on the other slices is excluded from this estimate, as instructed."

The food item specified is a 'barre de chocolat kinder,' which visually matches the Kinder Chocolate bar shown in the image. This particular bar has a distinctive shape with four segments and a creamy white coating with brown chocolate edges. The size can be roughly gauged by comparing it to the wooden surface, taking into account the typical size of a Kinder Chocolate bar sold in Switzerland. A standard Swiss Kinder Chocolate bar weighs approximately 23 grams. The portion in the image appears to be a full bar without any visible pieces missing or broken off. There is no container or packaging visible that might affect the estimation, so the weight is taken as the full bar's standard weight. Checking against reference, a typical Kinder Chocolate bar piece is about 20-25 grams, so 23 grams is a reasonable estimate. Therefore, the estimated weight in grams for the 'barre de chocolat kinder' shown is 23 grams."

The carrot slices number around 15 visible pieces, each about 1.5 cm thick and approximately 3-4 cm in diameter. A typical carrot piece of this size weighs approximately 10-15 grams. Given the visible quantity, estimating an average of 12 grams per slice, and about 15 slices, this leads to approximately 180 grams total. The slices appear distinct and not overly thick, so not likely to be more or less. The plate diameter (~26 cm) and relative size of the quinoa support this portion size. Therefore, the estimated weight of the carrot portion is about 180 g."

The specified food item is 'beurre' (butter). The image shows two slices of bread on a plate, one spread with Nutella and the other with a light layer of butter and mélasse. We focus on the butter portion only. Visually, the butter is spread thinly and unevenly over roughly half the top slice's surface. A typical slice of bread here looks to be about 15 cm long and 8-10 cm wide, a standard portion for a home loaf or bakery loaf in Switzerland. A thin butter spread on bread usually weighs around 5-10 g for a moderate layer. Given the relatively sparse coverage and the visible texture indicating a light spread, the butter weight is closer to the lower side of this range. Therefore, the butter amount is estimated at about 7 grams, consistent with a thin spread over half the slice surface area. This fits typical Swiss butter portion size for a lightly buttered bread slice and looks visually plausible. Other food items do not affect this measurement since we only consider the butter itself."

The specified food item is 'huile de lin' (linseed oil). In the image, there is no visible bottle or container of oil, so the quantity must be considered as a drizzle or small amount added to the dish. Typically, oil used as a dressing or drizzle on a plate like this would weigh around 5 to 15 grams. Judging by the shine and slight gloss on the vegetables and other food items, the amount appears to be a light drizzle, more than a thin coating but less than a tablespoon pour (which is about 14 grams). Comparing the size of the plate (~22-24 cm diameter) and the thickness of film visible, a reasonable estimate for linseed oil here is about 10 grams."

We need to estimate the weight of the oat flakes only. The oat flakes pile is roughly the size of half the bowl's bottom surface area. The bowl seems to be a small to medium cereal or soup bowl, typically about 15-20 cm diameter. The oats form a thin layer that is not heaped very high, probably about 1-1.5 cm thick. Considering oat flakes' density is relatively low and they do not pack densely, a loosely spread layer of approximately 1-2 tablespoons corresponds roughly to 10-15 grams. Visually, the oats seem close to 2 tablespoons by volume, so the weight estimate should be around 12-15 grams. This aligns with typical portion sizes of dry oats in small bowls for breakfast or cooking. Therefore, the best estimate of the flocon d'avoines weight in the bowl is 14 grams."

They resemble broken, thin wafer or biscuit pieces, not a whole biscuit. A typical single thin biscuit or wafer shard of this size in a dessert would weigh between 5 and 10 grams. Considering the visible amount, which is roughly a few small fragments totaling an area similar to half a standard biscuit, the total biscuit weight can be estimated around 8 grams. The biscuit is light and thin, and the fragments do not form a full biscuit, so a weight above 10 grams would be unlikely. This estimation aligns with typical biscuit weights and visual portion size in Swiss desserts."

The specified food item is ""parmesan,"" but it is not visibly distinct as a separate solid portion on the plate; instead, it appears to be integrated into the risotto aux asperges, likely grated or melted within the risotto. Therefore, the weight must be inferred as the amount of parmesan typically used in this portion size of risotto. The risotto serving looks like a modest home portion, roughly about 150-180 g total weight based on the diameter of the plate (about 26 cm) and the volume of rice and asparagus present. Typically, parmesan added to risotto is about 10% of the rice weight by standard recipe ratios. Since the rice part might be approximately 120-140 g cooked, parmesan used is likely around 12-15 g for this portion. There are no visible solid parmesan shavings or chunks, so we do not increase beyond typical grated cheese usage. This estimate aligns with the visual and typical cooking practice for parmesan in risotto in Switzerland."

The œuf dur (hard boiled egg) is visible on the left side of the plate, cut in half. A typical medium Swiss hard boiled egg weighs about 50 grams whole, with the edible portion slightly less after boiling (water content stabilizes). Since this is half an egg shown and then cut lengthwise, the total amount on the plate corresponds approximately to one whole egg, split and shown in halves. The size relative to the fork and knife, and to the other plate items, confirms a standard medium egg size. This means the weight of the œuf dur on the plate is about 50 grams. This matches Swiss norms for a medium boiled egg, neither over- nor underestimated."

The specified food is mélasse (molasses), seen spread thinly on one slice of bread. The bread slice size is about 10-12 cm long and 7-8 cm wide, typical of a homemade or artisanal loaf slice weighing roughly 35-45 grams. The mélasse is spread thinly with some visible patches of butter underneath, indicating a light application. Molasses is dense and viscous, but given the visible thin spread over approximately half the bread's surface, the volume is small. For a thin spread on a slice this size, the weight of molasses is likely around 5-8 grams. Estimating conservatively based on the visible layer thickness and coverage, 6 grams is reasonable and aligns with typical spoonful weights for a thin spread on bread."
