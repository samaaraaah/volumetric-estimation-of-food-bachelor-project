xjvrtk,tomates cerises,500.0,180,320.0,19.723865877712033,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/5ccbcf64-3631-48df-9e8a-85fb33dbf912,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'tomates cerises' (cherry tomatoes). They are located in a small rectangular cardboard punnet. Using the book beside the punnet as a scale anchor, the punnet appears approximately 15 cm long. Typical Swiss retail pink or brown cardboard punnets for cherry tomatoes generally come in 250 g or 500 g sizes. This punnet looks moderately full. Counting the visible tomatoes, there are about 18-20 individual cherry tomatoes on one layer, and there appear to be only one visible layer (no significant stacking visible). Each average Swiss cherry tomato weighs roughly 10 g (8-12 g). Multiplying 18 tomatoes by 10 g yields 180 g. The appearance and fullness does not suggest the entire punnet is fully packed as in retail, so 180 g is a reasonable direct sum estimate. The volume also seems consistent: cherry tomatoes are dense relative to volume, so about 10 g per tomato and 180 g total matches the observed quantity and packaging size. Therefore, the best estimate is about 180 grams for the entire visible amount of cherry tomatoes."
xjvrtk,séré maigre,145.0,450,305.0,5.451799802761341,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/6d7c5913-406a-449c-a95d-dae1cff11f27,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'séré maigre'. Visually, the séré maigre is presented in a bowl with a gold-colored spoon. There is no direct packaging visible for the séré maigre, so we must estimate based on volume and density. The bowl is medium-sized, likely around 12-14 cm in diameter, typical for small dessert or snack bowls. The séré maigre occupies most of the bowl's interior, and the thickness and consistency appear creamy and dense. The depth of the visible séré maigre seems to be about 3-4 cm on average. Using the visible spoon as a scale anchor (approximately 15 cm for the spoon length), the bowl's size estimation is reasonable. Thus, estimated volume roughly equals a cylinder of diameter 13 cm and height 3.5 cm: volume = π*(6.5)^2*3.5 ≈ 465 cm³. Séré maigre is a dairy product with a density close to that of yogurt or thick cream, around 1 g/cm³. This gives an estimated weight of approximately 460-470 grams. Considering some air and mix-ins like seeds, minor adjustment downward to around 450 g is plausible. The séré maigre is mixed with chia seeds and hazelnut puree, which may slightly modify density but not significantly enough to change the estimate by more than ±10 g. Therefore, the best estimate is about 450 grams."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,150,267.0,13.725221893491124,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'salade de tomates', which visually corresponds to the tomato slices on the plate. The plate appears to be a standard dinner plate, typically around 26 cm in diameter, judging by the size of the knife and fork placed beside it. The tomato slices cover much of the plate's surface. Each tomato wedge is roughly 5-7 cm in length and 1.5-2 cm thick. Tomatoes typically weigh around 150-200 g each in Switzerland. Here, the salad pieces together appear to come from one medium to large tomato, likely cut into wedges. The volume and density check aligns with a single tomato, as tomatoes are mostly water and dense but not heavy. The flax seeds, oil, and balsamic contribute negligible weight compared to the tomatoes. Summarily, I estimate the total weight of the tomatoes here to be approximately 150 g, consistent with the visual scale and portion size."
xjvrtk,épautre cuit,160.0,380,220.0,4.339250493096647,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/02911570-1e99-4b2c-9ad0-469321a8a342,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'épautre cuit' (cooked spelt). It is located on the left side of the glass container. To estimate the weight, first I identify a reliable scale anchor: the glass container has dimensions roughly typical of meal prep containers, around 15 cm per side. The spelt grains appear to fill about one third of the container volume. Considering the container is approximately 4 cm deep, the volume occupied by the spelt is about 15 cm × 7 cm × 4 cm = 420 cm³ (rough approximation). Cooked spelt has a density close to cooked whole grains such as cooked brown rice, approximately 1 g/cm³ or slightly less. Given the visual compactness, a density of about 0.9 g/cm³ is reasonable. Therefore, weight estimate = 420 cm³ × 0.9 g/cm³ = 378 g. Reviewing the quantity, 350-400 g of cooked spelt in a meal prep container of this size is plausible. Cross check against typical meal portions of cooked grains (usually 150-200 g per serving), this looks like around 1.8 to 2 servings but visually coherent with the amount shown. Hence, I estimate approximately 380 g."
wrah5h,pâtes,148.0,360,212.0,3.8678500986193294,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/115dbd14-27ca-4200-a232-fa9f3eb9bad7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The food item to estimate is 'pâtes' (pasta). The container appears to be a typical stainless steel meal tray often used for meal prep or cafeteria servings. Using the metal tray's width, estimated at about 20 cm, as the scale anchor, the pasta portion occupies roughly half the tray's width and nearly the full depth of the tray. Visual volume of the pasta portion is approximately 10 cm (width) x 15 cm (length) x 2.5 cm (depth). The pasta is spiral shaped and appears cooked in a sauce, so it will be denser than dry pasta. A typical density of cooked pasta is around 0.96 g/cm³. Estimated pasta volume = 10 x 15 x 2.5 = 375 cm³. Multiplying volume by density gives an approximate weight: 375 cm³ x 0.96 g/cm³ = 360 grams. This estimation is plausible for a single serving portion of pasta with sauce. Therefore, the estimated weight for the visible cooked pasta portion is about 360 grams."
wrah5h,pâtes,123.0,260,137.0,2.077292899408284,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1550c506-8c95-461f-b658-8f427dc2a0af,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'pâtes'. The plate appears to be a typical dinner plate, around 26 cm in diameter, which can be used as a reference scale. The portion of cooked pasta occupies about one third of the plate surface, forming a moderately thick layer. Cooked pasta has a density around 1 g/cm³ since it is mostly water absorbed with starch. Estimating the pasta's footprint roughly as a circle segment with a diameter of about 12-14 cm, and thickness around 1.5-2 cm (typical for a mound of spiraled pasta), the volume would be approximately: π*(7 cm)^2*1.75 cm ≈ 270 cm³. Since density is about 1 g/cm³, the weight should be close to 270 g. Cross-checking with typical Swiss serving size ranges: a standard cooked pasta portion is often around 140-180 g; the portion here seems a bit more generous but not excessively so. Considering visible density and comparing to other foods on the plate, 250-270 g is reasonable. Therefore, 260 g is a balanced estimate for this portion of cooked pasta."
wrah5h,"légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)",198.0,65,133.0,3.246301775147929,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/5e117510-fc82-4a06-a502-12983d55aac5,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is ""légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)"" visible on the right side of the plate. To estimate the weight, first I observe the standard plate size, which appears to be a typical dinner plate about 26 cm in diameter as a scale anchor. The vegetables cover an area roughly 8 cm by 6 cm on the plate surface. The thickness/depth of the vegetable portion is estimated to be about 1.5-2 cm based on layering and shadows, indicating a moderate pile, not too dense. The vegetables are sautéed, so some moisture is retained but the density should be slightly less than water (around 0.7 to 0.9 g/cm³). Calculated volume is approximately 8 cm × 6 cm × 1.7 cm = 81.6 cm³. Applying a density estimate of 0.8 g/cm³ for sautéed mixed vegetables gives a weight estimate of roughly 65 grams. Checking plausibility: This portion size matches a moderate portion of mixed cooked vegetables on a meal plate in Switzerland. Thus, the estimated weight of the ""légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)"" is about 65 grams."
xjvrtk,myrtilles,200.0,70,130.0,3.2051282051282053,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/4d153e2f-e2dc-478b-80de-472793d5b51e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries). The blueberries are contained in a small bowl held in the hand. To estimate scale, the most reliable anchor is the human hand; an average adult hand's palm width is approximately 8-9 cm. The bowl appears to be about the size of a small dessert bowl, roughly 10-12 cm in diameter and about 4-5 cm deep judging by the visible curvature and the blueberries' height. Blueberries are generally spherical with an average diameter around 1.2-1.5 cm. By counting the visible blueberries loosely packed on the surface, there are approximately 40-50 visible berries. Given the volume visible and accounting for an approximate layer thickness (likely one layer, as blueberries stack but the bowl isn't very deep), the bowl is moderately filled but not heaping. Swiss retail blueberry clamshells usually come in 125 g or 250 g net weights. This amount appears to be less than a full clamshell, closer to half or less. Using per-unit weight is effective here: 1 blueberry weighs around 1.3-1.7 g. Multiplying an estimate of ~45 blueberries by 1.5 g gives about 67.5 g. Checking volume: the bowl volume visible (~10 cm diameter × 4 cm depth) is about 314 cm³, but due to gaps and air between berries, actual berry volume is less, consistent with around 65-75 g weight total. Therefore, the most defensible estimate for the weight of these myrtilles is approximately 70 grams."
ppf8hc,salade de pâtes,73.0,200,127.0,1.1428747534516766,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/7e81c5ce-4e03-49fb-93d4-0aca33571c65,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, the specified food item is 'salade de pâtes'. Visually, the salad of pasta occupies a moderate portion of the plate. We can use the standard dinner plate as a scale anchor, which typically has a diameter of about 26 cm. The pasta salad occupies roughly one-quarter of the plate's circumference and surface area, making it approximately 12 cm by 7 cm in spread. The pasta shape is spiral, typical of dense cooked pasta salad with vegetables, indicating moderate volume. The height of the pasta salad appears to be around 2 cm on average, based on the visible pile. Volume estimation: 12 cm x 7 cm x 2 cm = 168 cm³. Cooked pasta density is roughly 1.2 g/cm³ due to water content and dressing. Multiplying: 168 cm³ x 1.2 g/cm³ = about 200 g. The pasta salad contains pieces of vegetables (pepper, corn, tomato), which add a small amount of weight but not significantly more. Thus, an estimate of about 190-210 g is plausible. Cross-check with typical Swiss portions: a serving of pasta salad is commonly between 150-250 g. This fits well within expected portion size. Therefore, the best estimate is around 200 g."
ppf8hc,poulet,98.0,215,117.0,1.4134615384615385,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/9c8fc2f7-062d-4701-885c-184a8d501c5b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food to estimate is 'poulet' (chicken). On the black plate, the portion of chicken looks like a cooked piece of breast or ratite part with some sauce below it. The plate appears to be standard, roughly 26 cm in diameter (common reference for dinner plates). The chicken piece covers approximately a quarter of the plate’s radius length, roughly 10-12 cm long and about 6-7 cm wide. Thickness seems moderate, about 2-3 cm, which is consistent with boneless cooked chicken breast or fillet. Using this, the approximate volume is length x width x height = 12 cm x 7 cm x 2.5 cm = 210 cubic cm. Cooked chicken breast density is about 1.03 g/cm3, so weight = 210 x 1.03 ≈ 215 grams. Checking typical Swiss cooked chicken breast portions support this estimate: a cooked chicken drumstick is 60-90 g, while a cooked breast fillet or large portion is usually in the range of 180-220 g. The visible size here is slightly larger than mid-sized breast portion. Also, comparison to French fries portion and salad supports a mid-sized chicken fillet. Therefore, the best estimate for the 'poulet' portion weight here is about 215 grams."
xjvrtk,courgette et oignons,300.0,195,105.0,3.883136094674556,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'courgette et oignons,' which is the cooked zucchini and onions mixture on the left side of the glass container. First, we establish the scale: the container appears to be a square glass container roughly similar to typical lunchbox containers, estimated around 15 cm by 15 cm in footprint. The veggie portion takes up about half the container area. The zucchini slices are cut into roughly 1-1.5 cm thick pieces, and the depth of the portion seems to be about 2-3 cm of loosely packed cooked vegetables. Considering the density of cooked zucchini and onions, which is around 0.6 to 0.8 g/cm³ due to water content and soft texture, the volume estimate is approximately 15 cm x 7.5 cm x 2.5 cm = about 280 cm³. Multiplying volume by density gives approximately 280 cm³ x 0.7 g/cm³ = 196 g. This is consistent with expected weights for a mixed vegetable side portion in a small container. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'courgette et oignons' is about 195 grams, rounded slightly."
wrah5h,riz complet,82.0,185,103.0,1.0411735700197238,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/ee492174-b956-48fe-a4cb-4f059c9bc233,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The food item to estimate is 'riz complet'. The rice is served on a standard, large, 26 cm diameter dinner plate, which provides a reliable scale anchor. The rice heap covers roughly a 9 cm by 7 cm area on the plate and appears to be loosely piled with an estimated average height of about 2.5 cm based on volume and shadowing. Calculating approximate volume: 9 cm x 7 cm x 2.5 cm = 157.5 cm³. Cooked brown rice has a typical density around 1.2 g/cm³. Multiplying volume by density gives an estimated weight of about 189 g. Cross-checking: a Swiss standard 180 ml cup of cooked rice weighs 120-140 g, and 157.5 cm³ is close to 157.5 ml, so 180 ml cup reference roughly matches this estimate. Given the loose packing and plate presentation, 180-190 g is a reasonable estimate. No other container or packaging is involved to shortcut. The estimate fits expected portion sizes and looks plausible given the plate and other food items (salmon and carrot salad) for scale."
p96w4a,croissants au jambon,37.0,130,93.0,0.42418639053254437,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/7bd6e67d-b1ca-42e4-a5ca-713b7fadda27,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'croissants au jambon'. There are two croissants on the plate, both small-sized and filled with ham, appearing similar to mini croissants. A typical mini croissant weighs about 18-25 grams, while a filled ham croissant is heavier, around 60-90 grams for mini size. These croissants look compact and match the size of a small croissant rather than a large one. A standard dinner fork (about 19 cm) visible near the plate helps confirm the scale — the croissants are approximately 8-9 cm long, typical for mini croissants au jambon. Hence, each croissant likely weighs about 65 grams on average considering ham filling. For two croissants, that sums to about 130 grams. The density and volume seem consistent with this estimation, neither overly large nor too small when judged against other items on the plate like the baguette slices and salami slices. Therefore, the best estimate for the combined weight of the two croissants au jambon is approximately 130 grams."

The specified food item to estimate is 'poire' (pear). The image shows several sliced pieces of pear inside a transparent plastic container. The container is marked with volume lines, showing approximately 0.52 liters capacity, which serves as a reliable scale anchor. The pear pieces occupy roughly half of the container volume, around 250 ml. Pear density is close to water, about 1 g/cm³, meaning 250 ml corresponds roughly to 250 g in mass. The pear pieces are thick and fairly dense, confirming this approach. Typically, a medium Swiss pear weighs about 150-200 g, but here we have roughly one and a half pears sliced and packed, given the container size and volume estimation. Thus, the estimated weight of the pear in the container is around 250 grams. This aligns well with the visual evidence, container size, and typical pear density and weight ranges."
p8a2w5,tarte aux fraises,164.0,90,74.0,1.4960552268244576,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/7b64b358-b611-4155-8e79-6f3ce5b4f11a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The food item is 'tarte aux fraises', a strawberry tart slice visible on a standard-sized dessert plate, approximately 20-22 cm diameter typical for European porcelain plates. The slice covers about one-fourth to one-fifth of the plate's radius width, roughly 6-7 cm in length along the plate surface and about 3-4 cm wide. The tart thickness appears around 2-3 cm, including crust, cream filling and strawberries on top. Strawberry size is typical medium, roughly 15-20 g each and there are five to six strawberries on top, but the main weight comes from the creamy filling and pastry base. A whole strawberry tart in Switzerland usually weighs around 600-700 g for a 20 cm tart. Given this slice is about 1/6 to 1/8 of the whole tart by area, the expected weight for this portion is around 80-110 g. Considering visual fullness, thickness, and strawberry count, the more likely weight is near 90 grams. This fits Swiss typical serving sizes and appears consistent with visual volume and density estimates."

The specified food item is ""légumes (courgette, oignon, 1 cs d'huile d'olive)""—the cooked vegetables portion. The plate is a typical dinner plate approximately 26 cm in diameter, which we can use as a scale anchor. The vegetables occupy roughly one-third of the plate's surface area. The visible vegetables are sliced courgettes and onions, cooked likely with one tablespoon of olive oil as indicated, which adds a bit of weight but is mostly absorbed or evaporated in cooking. Slices of courgette and onion are thin, and the portion looks moderately piled but not heaped. A typical density for cooked vegetables (mostly water) is around 0.8-1.0 g/cm³. Given the plate size and portion area, the vegetable mass appears to be around 100-120 grams of fresh weight. The oil weight (1 tablespoon = ~13.5 g) is ingested as part of the veggies, but since not all oil may remain in the food, and it blends with the vegetable weight, adding the oil weight entirely would overestimate. Hence, including oil absorption, an estimate of about 110 grams total for the cooked vegetables is reasonable. This aligns with typical portion sizes for sautéed vegetables accompanying a main meal in Switzerland."
ppf8hc,spaghetti,217.0,150,67.0,1.7922830374753451,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/7c7d7932-0ffe-47e1-83e9-2289044511e5,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'spaghetti'. In the image, the spaghetti is served on a standard-sized plate placed on a digital scale. The plate looks like a typical dinner plate, about 26 cm in diameter. The spaghetti is spread over most of the plate's surface but not heaped very high, indicating a typical portion size. The visible portion covers roughly a flat spreading about 20 cm in diameter, with a thin layer about 1.5 to 2 cm thick due to the loose nest. Assuming a cylindrical volume approximation: volume ~ π * (10 cm radius)^2 * 1.8 cm thickness = approximately 565 cm³. Cooked spaghetti has a density roughly between 0.7 and 1.0 g/cm³, as it is quite dense when cooked and not airy. Using a moderate density of 0.9 g/cm³ results in approximately 509 grams. However, this seems high because the pasta is loosely spread and not packed densely. Taking into account a more realistic portion size for spaghetti in Swiss meals, personal servings typically range between 120 g and 180 g cooked weight. Given the thin layering and the typical plating style, 150 g cooked spaghetti is a suitable estimate. No container or package is involved here; the plate size served as the scale anchor. Adjacent objects (scissors) match scale expectations, confirming proportions. The pesto and gruyère are present but excluded from this count. Therefore, the most defensible estimated weight for the visible spaghetti on the plate is about 150 grams, fitting within typical Swiss portion ranges and visual cues."

The specified food item is 'fraises' (strawberries). There are 4 strawberries visible in a small bowl. Using the bowl diameter as a scale anchor, the bowl seems to be about 12-14 cm in diameter, which is typical for a small cereal or dessert bowl. The strawberries occupy the bottom of the bowl with some space around them, indicating medium to large size strawberries. Typical Swiss strawberries weigh between 15-25 grams each. The largest strawberry appears quite large, close to 25 g, while others appear medium-sized, around 15-20 g. Estimating roughly, 1 large strawberry (~25 g) plus 3 medium strawberries (~18 g each) gives approximately 25 + 54 = 79 g total. Rounding slightly for uncertainty, a final estimate of about 80 grams is reasonable and fits typical ranges for this amount and size of strawberries."

The specified food item is 'pomme', which is visible prominently in the image as a single red apple on a table surface. To estimate the weight, I rely on typical Swiss apple weights because no direct scale anchor like a fork or plate is visible here for precise size measurement. The apple appears small to medium size, judging by common apple dimensions and the relative subtle texture and shadow on the table. Swiss medium apples normally weigh between 150 and 180 grams. This apple looks slightly smaller than average medium and a bit rounder and compact than a large apple, so close to the lower-middle of that range is reasonable. Therefore, an estimate of about 160 grams for this apple is appropriate and aligns well with typical Swiss apple references. No container or packaging involved here, so no adjustments needed."

The food item is 'colrave crue', which is raw kohlrabi slices. The pieces lie on a standard-sized rectangular plastic tray lid, which seems to measure roughly 20 cm by 13 cm based on common car dashboard features for scale. The thickness of each piece appears quite thin, roughly 0.5 to 1 cm thick on average. The total visible volume of kohlrabi slices likely covers about 18 cm by 10 cm footprint, stacked about 1.5 cm high due to layering. This results in approximately 270 cm³ volume (18 x 10 x 1.5). Kohlrabi has a density close to that of water (about 0.75-0.8 g/cm³) given its high water content but firmer texture. Multiplying volume by density gives 270 cm³ x 0.78 g/cm³ ≈ 210 grams. The pieces don't fill the entire surface fully, some air gaps exist, so a slight reduction to about 180 grams is reasonable for the visible amount. This matches typical weights for this volume of raw kohlrabi. Hence, a good estimate is around 180 grams."

The image shows a red apple (pomme) next to a croissant de Sils on a wooden table. Using the apple as a scale anchor, it appears to be a small to medium-sized apple, typical of Swiss produce. Swiss apples usually weigh between 150 to 180 grams for medium sizes and up to 220 grams for large ones. This apple looks more on the small to medium side, slightly smaller than the adjacent croissant, which aligns with a weight estimate around 160 grams. The shape and surface reflect a fresh apple and the size is consistent with familiar Swiss apple sizes. Therefore, a realistic and visually supported weight estimate for this apple is approximately 160 grams."

The food item to estimate is 'chips vaya beans'. These appear to be a type of bean-based chip, looking somewhat like thin, crisp, triangular chips with visible green and black specks indicating beans. The chips are served on a standard-sized dinner plate, which is about 26 cm in diameter based on standard Swiss dishware. The chips cover roughly a central circular area about 15 cm in diameter and are layered in about 1 to 1.5 cm depth. Bean chips are typically light and airy but denser than air-puffed snacks, with a density likely between 0.4 to 0.6 g/cm³. Estimating the volume: the pile is roughly a circular area of radius 7.5 cm, so the area is approximately 177 cm². With a depth of about 1.3 cm average, volume is roughly 230 cm³. Multiplying by density midpoint (~0.5 g/cm³) gives approximately 115 g. This aligns well with typical portion sizes of bean chips and looks consistent with visual observation of fullness on the plate. Therefore, the estimated weight is approximately 115 grams."

The specified food is ""tomates"" (tomatoes). The tomatoes are visible as two slices near the top right of the wrap. To estimate their weight, I first confirm scale: the wrap is on a dinner plate which seems to be a standard size of about 26 cm diameter (typical Swiss plate), and the wrap diameter is approximately 22 cm, a standard galette wrap size. Each tomato slice looks to be roughly 4-5 cm in length and about 1 cm thick at most. There are two slices, as visible. A typical medium Swiss tomato weighs about 150-180 g whole. A tomato slice of this size (roughly a quarter of a medium tomato) would approximately weigh 35-45 g. Since there are two slices, combined weight is about 70-90 g. Considering some variability in thickness and water content, a good estimate is around 80 g in total. Cross-checking with typical tomato density and volume of the slices supports this estimate as realistic and fits well with the visible portion on the wrap."

First, we identify the specified food item 'carotte' on the plate. The carrots are sliced into fairly thick rounds, showing a bright orange color. Each slice appears about 2-3 cm in diameter and roughly 1.5-2 cm thick. There are around 15 slices visible. Using the plate as a scale anchor, which seems like a standard 26 cm dinner plate, the carrot slices' size is consistent. Assuming a carrot slice density close to water (1 g/cm³, since they are mostly water), the volume of one slice can be roughly estimated: area ~ π * (1.25 cm)^2 ≈ 5 cm², thickness ~ 1.8 cm, volume ≈ 9 cm³. Weight per slice ~9 g. Multiplying by 15 slices gives approximately 135 g. Considering some irregularity, some slices smaller or thicker, we can round this to about 130 g. This aligns well with typical carrot weights for this volume. No other containers or packaging is involved, so direct volume-based estimation is appropriate."

The image shows four pizza slices on a standard-sized square white plate. Given the plate size, the pizza appears to be a personal-sized pizza approximately 22-24 cm in diameter, which commonly weighs around 300-350 g whole. There are four slices here, but one slice is notably smaller indicating roughly 4.5 slices in the original pizza (estimate from pie fraction). Each full slice of this size pizza would weigh around 60-70 g. The slices here appear to be of average thickness and typical toppings density (cheese, sliced mushrooms, olives, courgettes), all reasonably light toppings that add little extra bulk. Given the partial slice and moderate density, a total weight estimate for the four slices combined is about (3.5 full slices × 65 g) = ~230 g in total on the plate. Since the task is to estimate the specified item 'pizza champignons, olives, courgettes' which encompasses all four slices pictured, we provide that total weight. This aligns well with common Swiss reference for personal pizza weights and looks reasonable by volume and density. Therefore, a defensible weight for the entire visible pizza portion is about 230 g."

The specified food item is 'pain bis', which appears as two slices of brown bread in the image. The slices seem to be roughly the size of a typical Swiss sandwich bread slice, approximately 10 cm by 12 cm each. The bread appears to have some holes and texture consistent with whole grain, which suggests moderate density. Typical commercial pain bis slices weigh about 35-45 grams each depending on thickness and density, with artisanal or denser bread possibly on the higher end. The thickness here looks standard, not notably thin or thick. Given two slices visible, estimate each at about 40 grams. The total weight of both slices together would be about 80 grams. Since the question likely means the total bread portion (both slices), the best estimate is around 80 grams."

The specified food is 'sauce bolognese' on a plate of spaghetti with grated cheese on top. The plate is a white ceramic dish with a typical dinner plate diameter of approximately 26 cm, which is a common reference size. The sauce covers about one-third to one-half of the pasta surface in a thick layer that is roughly 15 cm long and 8 cm wide, with an estimated thickness around 1.5 cm on average. The volume of the sauce can be approximated as 15 cm × 8 cm × 1.5 cm = 180 cm³. Bolognese sauce has a density close to that of a thick tomato and meat sauce, approximately 1.0 g/cm³. Therefore, the weight estimate based on volume is approximately 180 grams. This aligns with a typical portion of Bolognese sauce served with pasta in home-cooked meals in Switzerland, where sauce portions are around 150-200 grams depending on the amount of meat and tomato. The cheese on top is separate and not included in this estimate as per instructions. Hence, the estimated weight of the 'sauce bolognese' on the plate is 180 g."

The specified food item is 'muesli nature.' In the image, the muesli is presented in a small, round, shallow brown bowl. To gauge size and volume, I compare the bowl to the white square bowl holding yogurt next to it. The white bowl has handles roughly 8 cm wide each, and the depth of bowls of this type is typically around 5 cm. The muesli occupies most of the bowl volume, forming loose clusters of grains, which have a relatively low density compared to solid foods. Muesli typically weighs about 0.4-0.5 g/cm³ due to its aerated structure and inclusion of oats and nuts. Approximating the bowl's volume as roughly a cylinder (diameter approximately 10 cm, height of about 5 cm), its total volume is around V = π * (5 cm)^2 * 5 cm ≈ 392 cm³. Since the bowl isn't tightly packed to full height and muesli is aerated with gaps, let's take effective filled volume around 60% of bowl volume, estimating muesli's volume at about 235 cm³. Multiplying by density (0.45 g/cm³) gives approximately 106 grams. This estimate aligns with typical serving sizes of muesli in Swiss breakfasts and the visual fullness of the bowl. Therefore, the most defensible estimate for muesli nature in the image is about 105 grams."

The food item to estimate is 'pain/galette', which in this context appears as a wrap or flatbread rolled around fillings. The size of the container (a standard metal lunch box) can be used as a scale anchor. The container's width appears to be about 20-22 cm, similar to common lunch boxes. The 'galette' is folded and occupies roughly two-thirds of the container lengthwise, so about 14-16 cm long, and about 7-8 cm wide. Tortilla wraps or galettes typically have a weight of 40-60 grams for 20-25 cm diameter versions. Given this wrap is roughly standard size and folded, the visible portion corresponds to approximately one full wrap or slightly less. Considering the slight compression and that it is filled, but only the wrap itself is counted, a reasonable estimate would be near the typical weight of a large flatbread/tortilla around 50 grams. Volume x density sanity check also matches as flatbreads are low density. Thus, estimating the weight of the portion of 'pain/galette' shown at around 50 grams is appropriate."
p8a2w5,pizza,57.0,22,35.0,0.2459319526627219,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/eb0dd196-9c09-40d1-8e3d-e5f66c794af8,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The food item to estimate is 'pizza.' The image shows a small remaining slice of pizza on a white dinner plate with a standard fork and knife nearby. The plate looks like a standard Swiss dinner plate around 26 cm in diameter, which is a reliable scale anchor. Comparing the pizza slice with the fork (approximately 19 cm long) and plate size, the pizza slice appears to be about 6-7 cm wide at the crust and about 6-7 cm long, consistent with less than 1/8 of a personal pizza. Typical personal pizzas in Switzerland are around 22-24 cm in diameter, weighing about 300-350 g total. If a whole pizza is 8 slices, each slice weighs about 40-45 g on average, depending on toppings and thickness. The slice shown has visible toppings but is quite small, likely about half or slightly less of a full slice, perhaps due to partial consumption. Therefore, logically, the visible piece weighs about half a slice or slightly less, roughly 20-25 g. The pizza appears to have a normal crust thickness and toppings, matching a typical personal pizza slice density close to 1 g/cm³. There are no signs of an unusually thick or thin crust. Using the plate, knife, and fork for scale confirms the portion size estimate. Thus, the best estimate for the weight of this remaining pizza piece is about 22 g, consistent with the visual size and Swiss references."

The specified food items are galettes millet, haricots noirs, and maïs. From the image, the galettes millet (millet patties) are clearly visible on the right side of the bowl. Each galette appears approximately 6-7 cm in diameter, which can be confirmed by comparing to the salad ingredients in the same bowl, roughly a medium-sized bowl about 18-20 cm wide. Given the relative size to the bowl and the other food items, these millet galettes are homemade or small-size savory pancakes with visible blackened spots indicating they were cooked on a pan. There are 5 galettes piled with slight overlapping. Each galette is likely flat but with some thickness around 1 cm. Typical millet galette density should be moderate, denser than bread but less than meat, around 1.0 g/cm³. The volume of one galette is roughly a 6.5 cm diameter circle with 1 cm thickness, so volume per galette is approximately π * (3.25 cm)^2 * 1 cm ≈ 33 cm³. Multiply by density 1.0 g/cm³ gives about 33 g per galette. For 5 galettes, total weight is about 5 * 33 = 165 g. For the ingredients inside the galettes, haricots noirs (black beans) and maïs (corn) are presumably included in the patties. Standard small cooked black beans weigh about 0.5 g each. In a patty, they would be mashed or chopped, so we consider the total volume. The presence of beans and corn would increase weight but still consistent with the rough density estimate of 1 g/cm³. Thus 165 g is a reasonable estimate. To cross-check, typical commercial millet galettes of this size weigh 30-40 g each, matching our calculation. No packaging is visible, so we rely on volume and density, not retail weights. Therefore, final estimate for the combined food item 'galettes millet, haricots noirs, maïs' is approximately 165 grams, representing all visible patties together in the bowl."

The specified food item is 'salade (salade verte, carottes, avocat, 1cs huile d'olive, 1 cs vinaigre)'. In the image, the salad is the green leafy portion mixed with carrot ribbons and avocado visible on the plate. A standard dinner plate is typically about 26 cm in diameter, which can be used as a scale anchor. The salad covers roughly one third of the plate's surface. Given its volume and loose composition, the salad likely has some height of about 2-3 cm considering the avocado pieces and dressing. The lettuce is light and airy, carrots are denser, and avocado adds some weight due to its creamy density. One tablespoon (1 cs) of olive oil weighs approximately 13.5 g and one tablespoon of vinegar adds negligible mass but contributes liquid volume. The avocado portion appears to be about a quarter of a medium avocado, translating to roughly 50 g (a medium avocado weighs about 200 g). The lettuce portion seems to be around 50-60 g, and the carrots approximately 20-30 g (thin ribbons). Summing up the components, including dressing absorbed or mixed into the salad, the total weight is estimated to be about 130 g. This aligns well with typical Swiss salad portion weights and looks plausible given the volume on the plate. The salad is served loose directly on the plate without any container, confirming that the volume estimate and component weights align as the best method."

The image shows a galette wrap spread with demi crème acidulée, topped with grated cheese, a slice of ham, tomato slices, grated carrot, and slices of avocado (avocat). The wrap rests on a standard 26 cm dinner plate, which serves as a scale anchor. The avocado portion consists of approximately 3 moderately thick slices arranged near the top-center of the wrap. A typical Swiss avocado weighs around 150-200 g whole. The edible portion (the pulp) is about 70% of the fruit weight. Given the thickness, slice size, and coverage on the wrap, the avocado amount is roughly equivalent to half a small avocado, or about 60-80 g of avocado flesh. To check, visually the avocado slices occupy roughly a 1/4 length of the wrap and are thicker than thin slices but thinner than a half fruit chunk. Therefore, estimating around 70 g is reasonable. This fits the typical serving size for avocado as a sandwich or wrap topping. Cross-checking volume: avocado density is about 0.96 g/cm³, and the visible volume seems consistent with this weight given the slice size compared to the plate diameter. Hence, the estimated weight of avocado on this wrap is 70 g."

The specified food item is ""pain"" (bread). There are two slices of bread on a standard white dinner plate. Typically, a standard dinner plate diameter is about 26 cm, which is a reliable scale anchor here. The two bread slices each are roughly 12-15 cm long and about 6-7 cm wide. The bread appears to be a rustic or country-style sliced bread, which is denser than very airy bread but not extremely dense. Thick sliced country bread usually weighs around 35-45 g per slice (source: typical Swiss bakery portions). The slices here are approximately average in thickness and size compared to the plate. Given that there are two slices, we estimate one slice around 40 g, so the total bread weight for these two slices would be approximately 80 g. Since the task is to estimate the weight of ""pain"" as it is shown (two slices), I conclude 80 g is a reasonable and defendable estimate. Cross-checking with volume and density: the bread thickness appears about 1.5-2 cm. Density around 0.3-0.4 g/cm³ fits well. So 80 g total bread is plausible."

The specified food item is 'galettes millet haricots noirs maïs'. In the image, these are the three round patties on the right part of the bowl. To estimate their weight, I need a scale anchor. The bowl's diameter appears to be about 18-20 cm, which is a standard medium bowl size. The galettes appear roughly 7-8 cm in diameter each and about 1.5-2 cm thick. Given their size and texture (grainy and dense due to millet, black beans, and corn), they are quite dense compared to airy foods. Density likely close to cooked grain-based patties which I estimate around 0.8-1 g/cm³. Let's estimate the volume of one galette as a cylinder: volume ≈ π × (radius)^2 × height. Radius ~4 cm, height ~1.7 cm. Volume ≈ 3.14 × 16 × 1.7 = ~85.5 cm³ per galette. For three galettes, total volume ≈ 3 × 85.5 = 256.5 cm³. Multiplying by density (~0.9 g/cm³) gives ~230 grams total. Confirming plausibility: Three patties of this size with these ingredients would reasonably weigh between 200-250 g. Therefore, the best estimate for 'galettes millet haricots noirs maïs' is 230 grams."

The poivron strips cover an area roughly 8 cm by 4 cm and have a thin layer thickness around 0.5 cm on average, given their sliced nature. Estimating the volume as 8 x 4 x 0.5 = 16 cm³. The density of fresh bell pepper is about 0.9 g/cm³. Multiplying volume by density gives approximately 14-15 grams. This matches well with a typical portion of sliced bell pepper for a meal.

The specified food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries). Looking at the image, the blueberries are mixed into a cereal and blood orange yogurt mixture in a bowl. We can identify a regular coffee cup and a glass of orange juice nearby, which help to scale and estimate bowl size. The bowl appears to be a medium-sized cereal bowl, around 15-18 cm in diameter, typical for Swiss breakfast settings. The blueberries are intermixed rather densely throughout the mixture, with visible berries on the surface and likely some hidden within. I count about 20-25 visible blueberries. Assuming an additional hidden layer of similar count, a total of roughly 40-50 blueberries could be present. Typical Swiss blueberry weight is about 1.5 g per berry. Multiplying 45 berries x 1.5 g = 67.5 g. This is consistent with the visible volume and density. Given the mixture with cereal and yogurt, this amount is plausible. The blueberries are somewhat embedded but not heavily crushed. Therefore, the estimate for 'myrtilles' weight within the mixture is about 65-70 grams, with 68 grams as a balanced estimate. This estimate is consistent with volume, density, and portion size norms for Swiss breakfast blueberry servings."

The food item 'glace noisette' is a hazelnut-flavored ice cream, shown here as a single serving scoop in a small bowl. The bowl diameter is roughly estimated at about 12-14 cm based on the typical size of such patterns and bowl design seen in common household tableware; the scoop occupies approximately half of the bowl's diameter. The scoop shape is an irregular roughly semi-oval form about 7-8 cm long, 4 cm wide, and around 3-4 cm high based on shadow and volume cues. Ice cream density typically ranges between 0.5–0.9 g/cm³ depending on air content; hazelnut ice cream tends to be moderately dense, about 0.7 g/cm³. Estimating volume roughly as an ellipsoid half-shaped: volume ≈ 4/3 * π * (3.5 cm)*(2 cm)*(2 cm) * 0.5 (half-ellipsoid shape) ≈ 29.3 cm³. Multiplying volume by density: 29.3 cm³ * 0.7 g/cm³ ≈ 20.5 g. Considering slight overestimation in volume and flattening of scoop, a weight around 20-25 g is plausible for this portion. This fits with typical serving sizes for ice cream scoops in home settings and small dessert bowls. Therefore, the best estimate for the 'glace noisette' weight is approximately 22 grams."

The image shows a slice of rhubarb tart on a white plate. The plate appears to be a standard dinner plate, approximately 26 cm in diameter, based on common size standards and the relative size of the fork and knife next to the slice. The knife is a typical Victorinox table knife around 20 cm long, confirming the scale. The tart slice occupies about roughly one eighth (1/8) of a typical tart diameter (assuming a tart size of around 26 cm, close to the plate size). A whole rhubarb tart usually weighs about 600-700 grams, as the rhubarb is watery but the tart base is dense. Given that the slice is about 1/8 of the tart, the weight estimate for this slice is about 1/8 of 650 g, which is approximately 80 grams. Additionally, the density and volume checks align: the tart slice is thin but densely filled with rhubarb chunks and a custard base, so 80g matches the size and ingredient density. Hence, the estimated weight for this slice of tarte à la rhubarbe is 80 grams."

There are about 8 spears visible, mostly whole, with an average thickness of about 1–1.5 cm. Cooked asparagus generally weighs around 5–7 grams per spear depending on thickness and moisture loss after cooking. Given the number of spears and their size, the total weight of the asparagus is estimated by multiplying the average weight per spear by the count. 8 spears × approximately 6 grams per spear results in roughly 48 grams. This is consistent with their visual volume and density (asparagus is not very dense but still firm), and fits the portion size typical for a side dish in Switzerland. Therefore, the estimated weight of the asperges is about 48 grams."

The specified food item is 'carottes'. The image shows a white bowl with cooked tagliatelle-style pasta mixed with slices of eggplant (aubergines), some carrots, and a melted portion of Gruyère cheese. The bowl appears to be a common size container, roughly around 15-18 cm in diameter, as deduced by the pasta width and typical table surface dimensions. The carrot pieces are visible as thin, flat slices mixed within the pasta and veggies, some around 3-4 cm long and 1-2 cm wide. Counting visible slices and assessing volume, there are approximately 6 to 8 slices of cooked carrot showing, with unlikely any hidden depth because the bowl is shallow and the food is quite spread out. The carrot slices appear thin, about 2-3 mm thick. Assuming carrot density around 0.85 g/cm³ (typical for cooked carrots), the total volume for these slices can be estimated roughly. Each slice volume ~ 4 cm x 2 cm x 0.3 cm = 2.4 cm³ approximated per slice. For 7 slices, total volume ~ 16.8 cm³. Multiplying by density, 16.8 cm³ x 0.85 g/cm³ ≈ 14 g. This value seems realistic for the visible portion of carrots in a mixed dish in such a container size. The carrots are not densely packed, and the quantity fits a typical side serving within a mixed pasta meal. Cross-checking against expected carrot serving sizes, this is reasonable and not overestimated. Hence, the estimated weight for the 'carottes' in this image is about 14 grams."

The specified food item is 'pain' (bread). There are two pieces of sliced bread with spreads (beurre, mélasse, confiture) on a standard white dinner plate. The dinner plate rim looks like a typical Swiss dinner plate, about 26 cm in diameter, which serves as a reliable scale anchor. Each bread slice measures roughly 8 cm in length and 5 cm in width, with a thickness around 1.5-2 cm, given visual cues and spread thickness. The bread is rustic with some holes, indicating it is light and aerated. Swiss bread density typically ranges around 0.3 g/cm³ for such rustic bread types. Volume estimation: around 8 cm x 5 cm x 2 cm = 80 cm³ of bread per slice approximately. Multiplying volume by density: 80 cm³ x 0.3 g/cm³ = 24 g. Since there are two slices on the plate, and the term 'pain' applies generally, each slice weighs approximately 24 g. This aligns well with typical slice weights of rustic bread (20-30 g per slice). Since the input only states 'pain' once without specifying slice quantity, and considering the image, I estimate the total bread visible together is about 48 g (both slices combined). However, as the label 'pain' is singular and both slices together constitute the portion, the estimate is 48 g total for the bread seen on the plate."

First, locate the specified food item 'viande' (meat) on the plate in the image. The meat portion is a single piece of cooked ground meat or a patty on the left side of the plate. For scale, the plate is a standard dinner plate, roughly 26 cm in diameter. The meat covers about one sixth of the plate surface, measuring approximately 9 cm by 5 cm. The piece is somewhat flat, about 1.5 cm thick on average. Volume estimate: 9 cm x 5 cm x 1.5 cm = 67.5 cm³. Cooked ground meat density is roughly 1.0 g/cm³ (meat is dense). So volume × density gives an estimated weight of around 67.5 g. Cross-check with typical Swiss cooked meat portion sizes: a cooked meat patty or steak piece is often 60-100 g, so this fits within reasonable range. Considering any moisture loss during cooking and the meat's charred edges, the estimate remains sound. Therefore, the best estimate for the weight of the 'viande' is approximately 68 g."

The specified food item is 'salade de céleri', which is located at the bottom right of the plate as a small mound of finely shredded white celery salad. The plate is a standard square dinner plate approximately 26 cm across, which serves as a reliable scale anchor. The portion of salade de céleri measures roughly 6 cm by 6 cm in footprint and is about 2 to 3 cm high, forming a modest mound. The volume can be estimated as about 6 cm × 6 cm × 2.5 cm = 90 cm³. Celery salad is mostly water with some fibrous matter and dressing, placing its density roughly at about 0.7 to 0.9 g/cm³ due to dressing and fibrous content. Selecting a mid-density estimate of 0.8 g/cm³, the weight estimate is 90 cm³ × 0.8 g/cm³ = 72 grams. Considering this is a reasonable portion size for a side salad of celery, and cross-checking that celery is light but dressing adds weight, the estimate fits well within plausible ranges."

The specified food item is 'salade de carotte, mais, tomates'. This salad is located at the top center of the blue plate. To estimate the weight, let's use the nearby pizza slices as a scale anchor. The pizza slices appear to be standard personal size slices, roughly one eighth of a 22-24 cm pizza, which typically weighs about 300-350 g total. Each slice then weighs about 40-45 g and is about 12-14 cm long from crust to tip. Comparing the salad portion to one pizza slice, the salad portion occupies roughly the same surface area as one slice but is less dense and less thick. The salad appears to be a mixed finely shredded carrot, corn kernels, cherry tomato pieces, and spinach or greens with a creamy dressing binding them. The salad depth appears thin, about 1.5 to 2 cm max, and the spread is loose, not compact. Approximating the salad's surface area to be about 13 cm by 8-9 cm (roughly 100-115 cm²), thickness about 1.5 cm, volume estimate is around 150 cm³. Given that carrots and corn and dressing combine to a medium density around 0.7-0.8 g/cm³ (since it is moist but not very dense), the volume times density estimate is roughly 150 cm³ * 0.75 g/cm³ = 112.5 g. This aligns well with the visual portion size and typical serving for salad portions on a plate that size in Switzerland. Cross-checking, the presence of visible ingredients like corn and cherry tomato pieces which are light, and shredded carrot which is moderately dense, supports not going much above 120 g. Hence, the most defensible estimate for 'salade de carotte, mais, tomates' on this plate is approximately 110 g."

The specified food item is 'pain' (bread). First, I locate the bread slice on the black plate. Its size can be compared against the plate and the omelette pieces. A standard Swiss slice of bread typically measures about 10-12 cm in width and 12-14 cm in height. The bread here looks like a whole slice with a typical thickness of about 1.5-2 cm. Bread density is low (about 0.3 g/cm³). Assuming dimensions: width ~12 cm, height ~13 cm, thickness ~1.5 cm, volume = 12 x 13 x 1.5 = 234 cm³. Multiply by density 0.3 g/cm³ gives approximately 70 grams. This estimate is consistent with typical Swiss sliced bread slice weights from whole wheat or mixed grain breads, which usually range between 50 to 80 grams depending on thickness and density. There is no container weight involved and the bread appears whole and uncut except one slice. Therefore, the bread portion on the plate weighs about 70 grams."

The item is a ""branche de chocolat,"" which visually resembles a chocolate stick or a chocolate-covered nut cluster bar. Estimating size: the object is placed on a wooden table with no direct scale like a fork or plate, but judging from the wood grain and texture typical of a table surface, I estimate the chocolate bar length is roughly 10-12 cm, and diameter about 2-3 cm. This size corresponds approximately to a medium-sized chocolate bar or a chocolate-coated biscuit stick. Given the dense texture (chocolate with some nuts or puffed rice pieces visible), we can approximate density similar to milk chocolate combined with nuts or crispy elements, roughly 1.2 g/cm³. Calculating rough volume: length ~11 cm × width ~2.5 cm × height ~1.5 cm = 41.25 cm³. Weight estimate: volume × density = 41.25 × 1.2 ≈ 50 g. This is consistent with known sizes of similar chocolate snack sticks or bars weighing between 40-60 g. Thus, 50 g is a reasonable, visually grounded estimate for the ""branche de chocolat"" shown in the image."

The specified food item is 'pain', which is bread. The image shows three slices of bread on a plate. To estimate the bread weight, I will first use the plate as a scale anchor. The plate appears to be a standard dinner plate, approximately 26 cm in diameter, as is common in Swiss households. Each slice of bread is about one-fifth to one-sixth of the plate diameter in length, indicating slices about 4.5 to 5 cm wide and approximately 10 to 12 cm long. The bread is a dense, artisanal variety with seeds visible. Typical Swiss bread density and slice sizes: an average slice of such bread weighs around 30 to 40 grams. Since there are three slices of similar size here, each piece likely weighs about 35 grams on average. This is consistent with the volume and density, as the bread appears to be slightly dense but not overly thick. Therefore, the estimated weight for the portion of 'pain' visible is roughly 3 slices × 35 grams = 105 grams. However, the task requires estimating only the specified item weight for all bread visible, so 105 grams is the best estimate based on visible slices and standard slice weights. This falls well within typical Swiss bread slice weight ranges and matches the visual scale. No container weight or other items are included."

The image shows four rectangular Blevita crackers stacked on a light wooden surface. Blevita crackers are typically thin and light, often used as low-calorie crispbread snacks. Based on common knowledge, a single Blevita cracker weighs approximately 10 grams. Visually, these crackers appear to be standard size, not unusually thick or large, consistent with this estimation. There is no container visible, so no need to estimate based on packaging. Using the known average per cracker weight multiplied by four crackers gives about 40 grams total. Considering the thinness and airy texture, the 10 grams per piece is reasonable and the total weight for the four pieces should be about 40 grams. This estimation aligns with typical Swiss reference data on crispbread and low-density baked goods."

The specified food item is 'tomate'. The image shows a rectangular container roughly the size of a typical meal prep box (about 15 cm by 10 cm). The tomato slices occupy roughly one third of the container lengthwise and nearly the full width. Tomato slices appear thin, about 0.5 cm thick on average. The volume they occupy is about 5 cm (width) × 10 cm (length) × 0.5 cm (thickness) = 25 cm³ approximately. Tomato density is close to water at about 1 g/cm³. Therefore, the tomato weight is about 25 grams by volume calculation. Visually, there are around 6-7 slices that correspond roughly to a medium tomato sliced, which typically weighs 120-150 g whole. Given that this is roughly one quarter to one third of a whole tomato, an estimate of about 30-40 g is plausible. Cross-check with volume estimate (25 g) and portion size of slices suggests around 30 g to be best estimate. Hence, 30 grams is a reasonable and consistent estimate for the tomato portion shown."

The specified item is 'galette millet maïs haricots noirs', visible as two small round patties in a plastic container along with grated salad and cheese. To estimate their weight, I will use the container width and the relative size of the patties. The patties appear roughly 5 cm in diameter and about 1-1.5 cm thick. Using a rough density approximation suitable for cooked millet, corn, and black beans combined (somewhat dense, around 0.9-1.0 g/cm³), I estimate volume as a cylinder: volume ≈ π × (2.5 cm)^2 × 1.5 cm ≈ 29.5 cm³ per patty. For two patties, volume ≈ 59 cm³. Applying density ~1 g/cm³, total weight ≈ 59 g. Given that moist legume-grain patties commonly weigh between 25-35 g each, this seems reasonable. Therefore, I estimate approximately 60 grams total weight for the two patties combined. Since the photo shows two patties, I report the combined weight."

The specified food is 'maréchal,' which from the image are the small cubed cheese pieces on the plate. Using the boiled eggs and cucumber slices as scale anchors, the cheese cubes measure approximately 2 cm per side, yielding roughly 8 cm³ volume for each cube. There appear to be about 4 cheese cubes visible. Typical semi-hard Swiss cheese density is about 1.1 g/cm³. Thus, each cube likely weighs about 8.8 g (8 cm³ × 1.1 g/cm³), and 4 cubes would be approximately 35 g. Considering slight variation in cube size and density, an estimate of 35 g for the 'maréchal' cheese cubes is reasonable and matches typical portion sizes visible on this plate."

The specified food item is ""pain"", which is a slice of bread visible in the image. The bread slice is on a standard white ceramic plate. A typical dinner plate has a diameter of about 26 cm in Switzerland, which can be used as a scale anchor. The bread slice appears to be a typical small round slice, approximately one quarter or a bit less of a small round loaf. This type of bread slice is about 10 cm in diameter. The thickness looks standard for sliced bread—around 2-3 cm including air pockets. Using typical density for bread, about 0.3 g/cm³, and approximating the bread slice as a round segment (quarter) of a loaf with a radius roughly 10 cm and thickness 2.5 cm, volume ≈ (π * r² * thickness) * fraction = π*10²*2.5*(~0.25) ≈ 196 cm³. Bread density 0.3 g/cm³ → weight ≈ 196 * 0.3 = 59 g. This matches typical Swiss bread slices which generally range 50-70 g depending on type and size. Given the bread looks fairly airy and standard size, a good estimate is around 55-60 g. Choosing a balanced figure, 58 g is realistic and consistent with visual scale and known bread weight norms in Switzerland."

The specified food item is a ""barre de chocolat kinder"" visible on a wooden surface. This item appears to be the typical small Kinder chocolate bar known as Kinder Bueno or similar. Typically, a single portion of these bars weighs about 40 grams in Swiss retail packaging. To confirm scale, consider the wood texture and typical wooden tile width: the bar length seems about 10-12 cm, which matches the known size of a Kinder chocolate bar. Kinder chocolate bars are fairly dense, largely composed of milk chocolate, cream filling, and wafer inside, so the weight estimate aligns with known product standards. Since the image shows a full bar and no partial pieces, the standard weight is a defensible estimate. Cross-checking with volume and density supports approximately 40 grams per bar. Therefore, the estimated weight for the visible Kinder chocolate bar is 40 grams."

The image shows two desserts on a standard-sized black plate, likely around 26 cm in diameter—a typical dinner plate size used as a scale anchor. The tiramisu piece occupies approximately a third of the plate's diameter in length, suggesting a length of about 8-9 cm. The tiramisu has a moderate height around 3-4 cm. Considering tiramisu density—cream and soaked sponge cake—it's denser than airy cake but lighter than solid pastries, roughly 0.6-0.8 g/cm³. Estimating the volume as roughly a rectangular prism: length 9 cm × width 4 cm × height 3.5 cm = about 126 cm³. Multiplying volume by density (0.7 g/cm³) gives approximately 88 grams. This aligns with typical Swiss bakery portions for individual tiramisu servings, which commonly range from 80 to 120 grams. Therefore, the estimated weight for this piece of tiramisu is about 90 grams."

The specified food item is 'salami'. First, I locate the salami in the image: it is the small pile of dark red circular slices on the right side of the plate. For scale, I use the standard white plate, which is commonly around 26 cm in diameter (Swiss standard dinner plate). Comparing the salami slices to the slices of bread and ham, the salami pieces are approximately 2-3 cm in diameter each and about 2-3 mm thick. There are about 6-7 visible slices, some broken into smaller pieces. A typical sliced salami piece weighs approximately 5-7 grams (standard thin cut). Based on the slices' thickness and amount, and total visible volume, the total weight looks like 6 slices × about 6 grams average = approximately 36 grams. Considering some pieces are broken and possibly thinner, it may be slightly less, around 30–35 grams. A density and volume check confirms this is plausible; salami is dense cured meat. Final estimate converges to about 33 grams for the salami shown."

The specified food item is 'sauce vinaigrette'. In the image, the vinaigrette sauce appears as a light drizzle on top of the tofu, carrot, and other ingredients, with some visible small droplets and a thin layer over parts of the food surface. The food container is roughly rectangular and made of metal, with a visible fork next to it. Standard dinner forks are about 19 cm long, and this container looks about 17 cm long. The sauce coverage is thin, and vinaigrette is a liquid with very low density compared to solid foods. Typically, such a drizzle is roughly equivalent to a small tablespoon spread thinly, likely about 15 ml in volume. Since vinaigrette density is close to water (≈1 g/ml), the weight is approximately equal to the volume in grams. Because the sauce is lightly spread and not pooled, the total amount likely weighs 10 to 15 g. Using a median estimate considering visible volume and distribution, the vinaigrette weight is about 12 grams."

First, the image shows a small grey plate holding strawberries (fraises), raspberries (framboises), and blueberries (myrtilles). The specified food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries). The plate size seems to be a small dessert plate, likely around 18-20 cm in diameter based on the wood grain and typical small plate dimensions. Using the strawberries as a scale anchor — regular large strawberries can be around 4-5 cm in length — aligns well with the plate being ~18 cm diameter. That means the blueberries are roughly 1-1.5 cm diameter each, which matches typical blueberry size. There are about 12 visible blueberries on the plate. Blueberries weigh about 1-2 grams each in Swiss averages, typically closer to 1.5 grams each. There may be minor overlap causing some blueberries to be obscured, but counting the visible and a slight allowance for hidden ones, assuming 1 hidden layer, seems unnecessary here as they rest in a single layer. So 12 blueberries × 1.5 g ≈ 18 g. Checking size with volume: blueberries roughly spherical of diameter ~1.3 cm means volume ≈ (4/3)*π*(0.65)^3 ≈ 1.15 cm³ each. Assuming density near 1 g/cm³ (mostly water), one blueberry is about 1.15 g. Multiplying by 12 yields about 13.8 g as a lower bound. The 18 g estimate is consistent with possibly slightly larger or denser fruits. Hence, 15-18 g is plausible. For a middle ground, 16 g is a reasonable precise estimate. Therefore, the weight of the blueberries ('myrtilles') is about 16 grams."

First, the specified food is 'épinards frais' (fresh spinach). In the image, the fresh spinach is visible as green leaves forming the base of the salad. The plate is a white ceramic bowl measuring approximately 20 cm across, which is a common size for such bowls, helping to establish scale. The spinach leaves appear fresh and uncompressed, loosely spread with some volume but mostly flat leaves. Given the coverage area on the bowl bottom and some layering but not densely packed, the volume of fresh spinach is moderate. Fresh spinach leaves have low density and are mostly air, with a density around 0.3 g/cm³. The quantity is roughly equivalent to about 1.5 to 2 handfuls, which typically weigh around 30-50 grams. Comparing to the cherry tomatoes (average 10-12 g each) and fallafels (each about 25-30 g), the spinach's volume suggests a weight near the lower end of that range.

Considering the plate is a standard dinner plate size (about 26 cm diameter), and the strawberries and bread slice proportions, the raspberries look average to slightly large-sized for raspberries. Each raspberry in Switzerland typically weighs about 4-5 grams given their average size. Multiplying 6 raspberries by about 4.5 grams gives approximately 27 grams. Also, compared to the strawberries nearby (generally 15-25 g each), the raspberry cluster's total volume and density seem consistent with this estimate.

First, I locate the mayonnaise on the plate: it is the white creamy portion on the left side of the plate. To estimate size, I use the fork nearby as a scale anchor. A standard dinner fork is about 19 cm long. The mayonnaise dollop is roughly 4-5 cm in length and about 2-3 cm wide. Thickness appears moderate, roughly 1.5 cm. This suggests a volume in the range of approximately 12-20 cm³. Mayonnaise density is about 0.9-1.0 g/cm³, since it is an emulsion. Multiplying volume by density, the estimated weight is roughly 15-18 grams. Considering the dollop is generous but not excessive, a mid-value of about 16 grams is appropriate. This estimate is consistent with a heaped teaspoon or slightly more, which typically weighs about 10-15 grams, so higher volume here aligns with visual observation.

By comparing the size of the croissant piece to the plate diameter, the croissant half measures approximately 7 cm at its longest, which fits well for a half of a standard-sized croissant. A full standard butter croissant in Switzerland typically weighs between 45 and 60 grams. Therefore, half of one would be expected to weigh roughly 22 to 30 grams. The croissant appears fresh with visible layers and a light, airy texture, typical of a butter croissant with a density around 0.25-0.3 g/cm³. Considering the size and typical density, the weight is likely near 25 grams. The butter and apricot jam (confiture abricot) add negligible extra weight here or are on top and separate. Thus, the weight estimate specifically for the demi croissant is about 25 grams, which is consistent with the visible size, typical croissant weights, and visual density."

In the image, the sprouted seeds are located in the middle of the bowl, atop fresh spinach leaves and alongside cherry tomatoes and falafels. To estimate their weight, first consider the scale reference: the bowl is a typical soup or salad bowl, approximately 18 cm in diameter based on the standard table surface. The cherry tomatoes, which average about 20-25 mm in length, provide further scale. The volume occupied by the sprouted seeds is roughly equivalent to a small handful or about 1/4 of a cup (~60 ml). Sprouts are very light and airy, with estimated density around 0.3 g/cm³. Multiplying volume by density gives an approximate weight of 18 g. Given some compression and layering, a plausible range is 15-20 g. Therefore, a reasonable estimation for the weight of the sprouted seeds present here is around 18 grams."
wrah5h,gaufre,47.0,37,10.0,0.05793885601577909,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1c8bc1a8-fbe8-4520-b82e-b07adc59e499,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'gaufre'. Visually, the waffle sits on a regular-sized dessert plate, likely around 20-22 cm in diameter, based on typical plate designs in Swiss households. The waffle appears rectangular, approximately 10 cm by 7 cm, roughly 1-2 cm thick. Given the even browning and thickness, it resembles a homemade or bakery-style waffle, not very thick or airy but more dense. Typical density for waffles is about 0.3 to 0.4 g/cm³ since they are airy but also compact. Calculating volume: 10 cm x 7 cm x 1.5 cm = 105 cm³ approximately. Multiplying volume by density (using 0.35 g/cm³ middle value): 105 cm³ x 0.35 g/cm³ = 36.75 g. Rounding for uncertainty, estimate weight around 35-40 g. This is plausible given the size and typical weight of such a waffle. Confirmed by comparison to common mini waffles in Swiss markets or homemade portions. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the weight of the gaufre is approximately 37 grams."
p96w4a,tartine mélasse + beurre,39.0,29,10.0,0.04807692307692308,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/c9db26cc-13d6-4355-97a6-2355ea46cf42,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'tartine mélasse + beurre'. From the image, this is the piece of bread on the bottom of the plate, spread with butter and a syrupy dark topping, identified as molasses (mélasse). The plate diameter provides a good scale reference: a standard dinner plate is about 26 cm in diameter. The bread slice is roughly one-third the diameter of the plate in length, about 8-9 cm long, and about 4-5 cm wide at the widest part. The bread appears to be dense, rustic whole grain with a crumb providing volume. The slice thickness is about 1.5-2 cm as judged by shadows and crust. Calculating approximate volume: 8.5 cm (L) × 4.5 cm (W) × 1.8 cm (thickness) = ~69 cubic cm volume. Whole grain bread has a density around 0.25-0.30 g/cm³. Applying 0.27 g/cm³ average density gives about 18.6 grams for the bread alone. Now adding the butter and molasses layer: butter spread is about 5-7 grams for this coverage size (thinly spread, about 5-6 g), molasses coverage is a thin layer, likely 3-5 grams. Total topping estimate: approx 10 grams. Adding bread + topping: 18.6 + 10 = about 28.6 grams. Rounded for uncertainty, a reliable estimate is around 29 grams. This fits Swiss typical portion sizes, slight variance expected due to bread type and topping spread thickness. Hence, 29 grams is the best defensible estimate for the weight of the tartine mélasse + beurre visible in the image."
m4egh2,oeufs,90.0,100,10.0,0.11094674556213018,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/7e7c07da-f8a5-4c6a-96b0-28284727895f,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'oeufs' (eggs). Looking at the image, there are clearly two fried eggs placed over the pasta with visible yolks and white parts. To estimate the weight, I use the standard weight of a medium-sized cooked egg in Swiss standards, which is about 50 grams per egg. Fried eggs lose some water during cooking but generally retain their weight close to raw weight. The eggs appear fully cooked without major loss. The eggs seem typical in size, not overly small or extra large. Since there are two eggs, I multiply: 2 eggs × 50 g ≈ 100 g total. The scale anchor is the plate, likely about 26 cm wide, consistent with typical Swiss dinner plates. The eggs occupy a space close to two whole eggs. The ketchup weight is excluded, and the pasta is excluded as per instructions. The estimate 100 g fits well within typical ranges for two fried eggs in this portion size and plating. Therefore, the best estimate for the 'oeufs' weight is 100 grams."
p96w4a,beurre,5.0,14,9.0,0.005547337278106509,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/9c8dd558-21eb-4150-a872-af92749663ff,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'beurre' (butter) visible on two slices of bread. First, examine the scale: the plate appears to be a standard dinner plate, approximately 26 cm in diameter. Each bread slice is roughly 12-14 cm wide. Butter is spread thinly over about half to two-thirds of each slice. A typical thin spread of butter on bread is generally about 5-8 grams per slice for a modest layer. Since there are two slices with visible butter coverage, and the coverage is not thick but more of a thin to moderate spread, the total butter could be estimated around 7 g per slice on average, totaling roughly 14 g. However, the task is to estimate the weight of butter alone, so considering the butter is spread on both slices, but 'beurre' is the food item as a whole, the total visible butter is approximately 14 grams. This is consistent with the volume (thin, even spread) and common portion sizes used in Switzerland for breakfast butter servings. The butter is not heaped or thickly dolloped, so higher estimates are unlikely. Therefore, the best estimate is about 14 grams total for the butter visible on the two slices."
2ahgvr,graine de chia,6.0,15,9.0,0.006656804733727811,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/cca1db77-eb8e-454d-8ea2-e23840f01b97,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item to estimate is 'graine de chia' (chia seeds). They appear mixed into a glass jar containing a mixture of yogurt, oats, oat bran, honey, and almond purée. The jar provides a scale anchor: judging by the mouth diameter and overall shape, it seems to be about 7-8 cm wide and roughly 9-10 cm high. The chia seeds are dispersed evenly throughout but visible as small black dots within the mixture. Typically, chia seeds absorb liquid and swell, so their volume increases but density remains roughly similar. The total volume of the jar content is approximately 200-220 ml. Chia seeds are lightweight but dense; a typical chia seed portion for such a mix would be about 15-20 grams to provide noticeable presence but not overwhelm the texture. Estimating by visual proportion, chia seeds appear to be approximately 10-15% of the total volume mixture, which matches an estimated weight of around 15 grams. Sanity check: 15 grams of chia seeds equals roughly 15 ml in volume (density about 1 g/ml), which fits well with the visible amount embedded in the jar. Therefore, 15 grams is a reasonable estimate."

The specified food item is 'mozzarella'. Looking at the image, the mozzarella is the white portion placed on top of the pasta. The plate is a standard dinner plate of approximately 26 cm diameter (based on common plate sizes and visible fork size to the top left). The portion of mozzarella appears as a dollop about 6-7 cm long, 4-5 cm wide, and roughly 2-3 cm thick. This roughly corresponds to a volume around 50-70 cm³. Considering the typical density of fresh mozzarella (~1.1 g/cm³, similar to soft cheese with water content), this yields an estimated weight between 55 and 77 grams. Given the visible portion, it is most likely around 60-65 grams. Also, this matches typical portion sizes for a fresh dollop like this on a meal plate in Switzerland. Cross-checking this estimate with typical Swiss mozzarella mini balls or portions aligns well without over- or under-estimation. Therefore, the best estimate for the mozzarella weight is about 63 grams."

The specified food item is 'salade'. The food is served on a standard 26 cm diameter dinner plate, which can be used as a scale anchor. The green salad portion sits to the left side of the plate. Visually, the salad covers roughly 1/3 of the plate's surface area. The salad looks loose with leaves lying flat and some sunflower seeds sprinkled on top. For leafy salad, a typical density is low, around 0.15-0.25 g/cm³ because of the air content. Considering the plate scale, the salad occupies approximately an area of about 12 cm by 8 cm in effective spread, with a loose pile roughly 2-3 cm thick at maximum—likely averaging about 2 cm thickness overall. So approximate volume is 12 x 8 x 2 = 192 cm³. Applying a density of about 0.2 g/cm³ (typical for leafy salad), the estimated weight is 192 x 0.2 = 38.4 g. This aligns well with a typical salad portion size as side dish accompanying a main meal in Switzerland. Thus, the estimate for the salade weight is about 38 grams."
p8a2w5,pillons de poulet,112.0,120,8.0,0.11045364891518737,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/bdb25c53-2eb7-4a81-b33e-6d28997d0183,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is ""pillons de poulet"" (chicken drumettes). On the plate, there are four chicken drumettes visible. Using the standard dinner plate as a scale anchor (approximately 26 cm in diameter), the drumettes are about the expected size for this type of chicken portion. Each cooked chicken drumette typically weighs between 25-35 g. Given their slightly charred and cooked appearance, they look like standard medium-sized drumettes. Summing four drumettes at an average of approximately 30 g each gives about 120 g total. This aligns with the volume and density expectations for cooked chicken. Therefore, the reasonable estimated weight of the chicken drumettes on the plate is 120 grams."
8japfq,hummous,42.0,34,8.0,0.04142011834319527,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/0bd218b2-a4c6-4605-8737-2055d3040f25,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'hummous,' located at the bottom left of the plate. To estimate weight, I will identify reliable scale anchors from the image. The plate appears to be a standard dinner plate of about 26 cm diameter based on its shape and visible cutlery. The hummous portion looks to occupy about 5 cm by 4 cm in footprint, with an irregular height of roughly 1.5 to 2 cm, based on shadows and comparison to surrounding items such as olives and the cottage cheese. The estimated volume is approximately 5 cm x 4 cm x 1.7 cm = 34 cm³. Hummous is dense and creamy, with a typical density near 1 g/cm³, so volume closely approximates weight in grams. Therefore, the hummous would weigh about 34 grams. Cross-checking typical small servings of hummous normally range between 30 - 50 g, so this estimate is credible. Thus, the hummous portion on this plate is approximately 34 grams."
2ahgvr,salade de pâtes,112.0,105,7.0,0.09664694280078895,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a1dcaa3e-bad0-4d16-a8e3-c6217544e407,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The food item is 'salade de pâtes' (pasta salad). The pasta salad is presented on a white plate that is a standard dinner plate approximately 26 cm in diameter (common Swiss and European size). This plate size is the scale anchor for estimating the volume of the food. Visually, the portion of pasta salad is small and spread unevenly across the plate center, roughly occupying an area of about 8-10 cm in diameter. The pasta used appears to be penne, about 4.5 cm long each piece. The quantity visible is approximately 15-20 penne pieces mixed with small amounts of corn, cherry tomato halves, and herbs. Given the pasta density once cooked and dressed (dense and moist), the depth of the pile is minimal, probably about 1.5 cm on average. Using volume as length × width × height: 10 cm × 8 cm × 1.5 cm = 120 cm³. Cooked pasta typically weighs around 0.7-1.0 g/cm³, pasta salad with dressing likely close to 0.9 g/cm³ due to oil and veggies. Therefore, estimated weight = 120 × 0.9 = 108 g. This estimate aligns with a small side portion of pasta salad, which is consistent with visual and typical serving sizes. Cross-check with count: 15-20 penne × approx. 2.5-3 g each (common cooked penne weight) = 37-60 g. Including vegetables and dressing adds weight, making total ~100 g reasonable. Hence, the best estimate considering volume, density, and visual count is around 105 grams."

The specified food item is 'yaourt nature'. In the image, the yogurt is presented in a typical Swiss retail plastic pot. Such yogurt containers commonly have a net weight of 125 grams. The pot size visually matches the standard 125g yogurt pot rather than the smaller 100g or larger 150g varieties. There is no visible indication that the pot is partially consumed; it looks mostly full. The apple nearby helps confirm the scale: a typical apple has a diameter of about 7-8 cm, and the yogurt pot appears proportionally correct for a standard 125g volume container. Using this, the yogurt pot likely contains approximately 125 grams of yogurt. This aligns with typical Swiss retail yogurt packaging and volume-density considerations for yogurt."
r3bub9,raviolis a la courge,143.0,150,7.0,0.1233974358974359,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/r3bub9/dish_media/17c1535c-dc84-4dbb-9668-1d3f9a4a135d,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is ""raviolis a la courge"" (squash ravioli). Visually, the ravioli portion is on a standard square plate which typically measures around 26 cm on each side, similar to a reference scale anchor provided in the instructions. The raviolis cover about one third of the plate in area. Each ravioli is roughly 4-5 cm across. Counting, there are about 6 ravioli visible. Squash ravioli in Swiss retail or home-cooked portions usually weigh between 20-30 g each depending on filling and dough density, as pasta filled with vegetable tends to be less dense than meat. Using 25 g average per ravioli and 6 ravioli, the total weight is approximately 150 g. Checking volume and density: the ravioli are not thick (roughly 1 cm thickness), giving a volume around (6×4.5×4.5×1) cm³ ≈ 120 cm³; pasta density is about 1.2-1.3 g/cm³ when cooked, yielding about 140-160 g, which matches the estimate. Therefore, the weight estimate of 150 g is plausible and consistent with visible portion size and reference data."

The specified food item is 'tomme fleurette'. Looking at the image, the tomme fleurette is the piece of cheese near the bottom right of the plate, characterized by its semi-soft texture and white rind typical of tomme cheeses. To estimate its weight, first, I identify a reliable scale anchor. The dinner plate is approximately a standard size, about 26 cm in diameter, and there is a standard dinner fork visible on the top side of the image, which is about 19 cm in length. Using the fork, the length of the piece of tomme fleurette is about 3 to 4 cm, width about 2.5 cm, and thickness approximately 1 cm. Given these measurements, the volume is roughly 3 cm × 2.5 cm × 1 cm = 7.5 cm³. The density of semi-soft cheeses like tomme fleurette is approximately 1.0 to 1.1 g/cm³, so the estimated weight is around 7.5 g to 8.3 g. Considering typical portion sizes and the visible amount, about 8 grams is a good estimate. This aligns well within the expected weight for a small piece of tomme fleurette cheese served on a plate as a tasting portion, and is plausible when compared to the sizes and weights of the other cheeses and the fish slices on the plate."
ppf8hc,parmesan,14.0,8,6.0,0.010355029585798817,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/2833b10a-52c7-409b-ad86-f6147c323f9e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is ""parmesan,"" but it is presented as part of a dish labeled ""risotto aux asperges, parmesan."" From the image, the visible food is a portion of risotto with pieces of asparagus and a creamy, possibly cheesy texture that likely includes the parmesan. There is no separate visible portion or distinct amount of parmesan cheese alone on the plate; it appears integrated and melted within the risotto. To estimate the parmesan weight, I first estimate the entire dish's weight on the plate using scale anchors. The plate shows standard size; a typical dinner plate is about 26 cm in diameter. The risotto serving occupies roughly a 10 cm diameter portion, or about 1/7th of the total plate area. Risotto is dense with a moist texture; typical density is around 1.0 g/cm³. Estimating the volume: the risotto pile is roughly 10 cm wide by about 1.5 cm high, approximating a cylinder. Volume ≈ π × r² × h = 3.14 × (5 cm)² × 1.5 cm ≈ 118 cm³, so about 118 g total weight. Parmesan cheese in risotto is generally used sparingly; typical parmesan additions are about 5% to 10% of total dish weight, as grated cheese for flavor and texture. Taking a mid-value of 7%, parmesan weight ≈ 0.07 × 118 g ≈ 8 g. This aligns with a usual ladle of grated parmesan mixed into a serving. Given the visible integration and no extra parmesan portion, this is the best grounded estimate. Therefore, estimated parmesan weight is about 8 grams."

The specified food item is 'beurre' (butter). Looking at the image, the butter is spread thinly under strawberry jam on four slices of bread. The bread slice dimensions, inferred from relative size to blueberries and raspberries, appear to be about 10 cm long by 6 cm wide. Butter is spread thinly enough to slightly cover most of each slice but not in thick dollops. Each thin spread is likely about 2-3 grams of butter per slice, given the typical density of butter and the spread visible. This results in an approximate total of 8-12 grams of butter for all four slices combined. Since the butter is not heaped or very thick, a conservative estimate near the low middle of the range is most accurate. Therefore, the estimated weight of butter on the plate is about 10 grams."
8japfq,branche de chocolat,25.0,30,5.0,0.015409270216962525,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/73d04325-9904-439c-a617-44a5061581a3,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The item to estimate is 'branche de chocolat', which is a chocolate bar with a nutty texture visible on the surface. The hand holding it serves as a scale anchor: an average adult finger width is roughly 1.5-2 cm. The chocolate branch is about as wide as two fingers, making it roughly 3-4 cm wide. Its length, though partially wrapped, extends about the height of three fingers (approximately 7-8 cm). Thickness seems moderate due to the nut clusters visible on the surface, about 1 cm or slightly more. Thus, the volume approximates around 3.5 cm x 8 cm x 1 cm = 28 cm³. Chocolate density varies about 1.2 g/cm³, but nuts reduce density mildly; assume roughly 1.1 g/cm³ average. Multiplying volume by density gives estimated weight about 30 grams. This aligns well with typical small Swiss individual chocolate bars or candy branches, which often weigh between 25-35 grams. Therefore, 30 grams is the consistent, reasonable estimate."

The specified food item is ""biscuit"". From the image, the biscuit appears as a few thin, broken pieces placed on top of a glass dessert. The glass is a standard-sized dessert glass, about 15 cm tall, which is our scale anchor. The biscuit pieces are about 4-5 cm wide and quite thin, likely 2-3 mm thick, visible above the ice cream. Given the biscuit's dry, crispy nature, typical density is about 0.6-0.8 g/cm³. Estimating the total visible biscuit volume: length approximately 5 cm, width around 4 cm for all combined pieces, and thickness about 0.2 cm. Volume = 5 cm x 4 cm x 0.2 cm = 4 cm³. Multiplying by density (~0.7 g/cm³), biscuit weight is about 2.8 g, rounding up to 3 g for small uneven pieces. This also matches typical small biscuit pieces used as dessert garnish. The biscuit is not a whole large cookie but small broken fragments, so the weight is low and plausible."
p96w4a,mélasse,6.0,1,5.0,0.0036982248520710057,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/b0979eb7-5126-4d9e-9058-64093ecde7e0,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item to estimate is 'mélasse'. Visually, the mélasse is spread on the top slice of bread on the plate. There are two slices of bread roughly each about 12 cm in length and about 6-7 cm in width, based on comparison to the standard white ceramic plate (estimated diameter ~26 cm). The mélasse covers roughly 50-60% of the surface of one slice of bread. 

Bread weighs approximately 25-30 g per slice of this size (a typical slice of a small baguette or rustic bread). Since only the mélasse is to be measured, we estimate the weight by thickness and spread area. The spread appears thin and uneven, similar to a drizzle or light coating. Molasses (mélasse) density is roughly 1.4 g/cm³, but applied as a thin layer the weight will be small.

Assuming the slice has about a 12 cm x 6 cm = 72 cm² area, and mélasse covers about half this with a thickness of about 0.5 mm (0.05 cm) or less. Volume estimate is 72 cm² * 0.5 * 0.6 (coverage) = ~21.6 cm³.

Weight estimate = volume * density = 21.6 cm³ * 1.4 g/cm³ = ~30 g. However, this seems high for a thin spread; the actual thickness is likely less (more like 0.1-0.2 mm) since molasses is viscous and typically lightly spread.

Re-estimating with 0.15 mm (0.015 cm): volume = 72 * 0.015 * 0.6 = 0.648 cm³.

Weight = 0.648 * 1.4 = ~0.9 g, about 1 gram.

This matches typical syrup/mélasse spread used on bread, which is modest. Thus, the more realistic estimate is about 1 gram of mélasse.

Cross-checking with the visible size and spread confirms this more plausible weight over earlier bulk assumptions."

The specified food item is 'galettes millet haricots noirs maïs', which correspond to the millet, black bean, and corn patties on the right side of the container. First, identify a scale anchor: the container is a square glass dish, likely a typical meal prep container of about 15 cm by 15 cm external dimensions. The patties cover about half the width of the container in a single layer, with five pieces arranged side by side. Each patty is roughly circular, about 5 cm in diameter, and about 1.5-2 cm thick based on visible height and shadow. Volume per patty is approximated as a cylinder: V = π * r² * h = π * (2.5)² * 1.8 ≈ 35 cm³ per patty. For five patties, total volume ~175 cm³. The density of cooked millet mixed with beans and corn is relatively dense, around 0.9 g/cm³ (due to grains and legumes). Multiplying volume by density gives 175 * 0.9 = 158 grams approximately. Considering no visible extra hidden layers or excessive air gaps, this is a good baseline. Confirming other visual clues: the patties are compact and not particularly dry or crumbly. The size and thickness are reasonable for a home-cooked portion. Therefore, an estimate of about 160 grams is appropriate for the entire portion of 'galettes millet haricots noirs maïs' shown."

The plate appears to be a standard dinner plate, approximately 26 cm in diameter. The scrambled eggs occupy roughly one-third of the plate's surface area, but their volume is not flat—they have some thickness, roughly 2-3 cm, judging by the shadows and contour. Scrambled eggs have a density of about 0.7-0.9 g/cm³ because they are light but cooked solid protein. The volume covered is roughly an oval about 10 cm by 7 cm by approximately 2.5 cm thick. Volume = length × width × height = 10×7×2.5 = 175 cm³. Assuming a density of 0.8 g/cm³, weight = 175 × 0.8 = 140 g. Cross-checking with typical Swiss portions of scrambled eggs: a single serving usually ranges 100-150 g, so this is plausible. Other foods on the plate (gnocchi, cauliflower) help confirm scale as the cauliflower florets are about 4-6 cm each, fitting the reference size. Therefore, the estimate of 140 g is reasonable and consistent with the visual evidence and known standard portion sizes for scrambled eggs."
p96w4a,beurre,3.0,7,4.0,0.0014792899408284023,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/1be5e2de-f1fe-4789-baf2-13f24ce8ca0a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'beurre' (butter) visible as a spread beneath the apricot jam on a slice of tresse bread. The slice looks about 10 cm across, placed on a standard 26 cm dinner plate, which helps confirm size. The butter is spread thinly, covering roughly half the surface of the bread. Butter density is high (~0.9 g/cm³), but the amount visible is only a very thin layer probably around 1-1.5 mm thick. The total area of the spread is approximately 50 cm² (half a 10x10 cm slice). Multiplying, volume = 50 cm² × 0.15 cm = 7.5 cm³. With density ~0.9 g/cm³, weight is roughly 6.7 g. Allowing for some uneven spreading and extra thin spot, a good estimate is about 7 g. This aligns with typical thin butter spread portions on bread slices. Therefore, the estimated weight of the beurre is 7 grams."

The specified food item is 'salade verte'. Observing the image, the salade verte is positioned near the center right of the plate, recognizable by the green leafy lettuce in light dressing. The plate diameter is approximately standard—around 26 cm—which can be confirmed by comparison to the knife and fork visible on the plate rim. The salade verte occupies a moderate portion of the plate surface, roughly around 1/6 to 1/7 of the plate's area. Lettuce has a low density, approximately 0.15-0.3 g/cm³, due to its airy leaf structure. Visually estimating the volume of the salade verte portion: the leaves are loosely piled, roughly a 7 cm by 6 cm footprint with a loose height around 1.5 to 2 cm, which gives an estimated volume of about 60-80 cm³. Using an average density of about 0.25 g/cm³ for dressed leafy salad, this corresponds to roughly 15-20 grams. Additionally, visual comparison to other goods on the plate supports this estimate because the salad does not appear heavily loaded or compressed. Cross-checking against typical Swiss portion sizes for a side salad confirms this estimate is reasonable. Therefore, the estimated weight of the salade verte is about 18 grams, a plausible value for the visible portion."
p8a2w5,beurre,5.0,8,3.0,0.0018491124260355029,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/9e3bfdbf-2b6e-41be-93ee-6610250b8c4e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'beurre', which is the butter portion on the bottom right of the plate. The butter chunk is about 3-4 cm in length and 1.5-2 cm wide, shaped as a small pat or slice. The plate appears to be a standard dinner plate (about 26 cm diameter), which confirms scale. Typical butter pats served in restaurants or home settings weigh around 10-20 grams depending on size. Given the small size and thickness visible in the image, this butter portion is less than a standard individual butter pat (usually closer to 10-15 g). It looks like a partial pat or slice, approximately half a tablespoon-sized quantity. Since a tablespoon of butter weighs about 14 grams, this portion likely weighs around 8 grams. This estimate is consistent with the visual size, typical pat sizes, and visual comparison to the plate and other foods. Therefore, the estimated weight for the butter ('beurre') is 8 grams."
xjvrtk,huile de lin,8.0,5,3.0,0.0029585798816568047,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/d15f25db-272a-4f8a-a0ae-225438cf4b70,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'huile de lin' (linseed oil). Visually examining the image, the plate shows several solid food items: beetroot purée, yellow tomato slices, black olives, courgette with onion, and millet patties containing black beans and corn. However, no distinct visible pooling or bottle of linseed oil is observed on the plate's surface or edges, nor a substantial sheen that indicates a large quantity. If there is linseed oil, it is likely used as a light dressing or mixed into one of the preparations, such as the courgette or millet patties. A typical drizzle or light dressing of linseed oil on a plate like this would be approximately 1 teaspoon = 4-5 grams. Given the absence of visible oil quantity, the most reasonable estimate for the linseed oil weight on this plate is about 5 grams, assuming a standard light drizzle or incorporation. This aligns with common culinary use and does not contradict the visible items. Therefore, the estimated weight of 'huile de lin' here is 5 grams."
2ahgvr,graines de chia,8.0,10,2.0,0.0019723865877712033,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/aa859e5b-563f-472c-9914-036722ebf60e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'graines de chia' (chia seeds) visible in the bowl mixed with other ingredients (blanc battu, flocons d'avoine, miel). The bowl is a standard-sized cereal or soup bowl, approximately 15 cm in diameter and 6-7 cm in visible height from the rim curvature and countertop scale reference such as the lighter (~7 cm length) nearby. The chia seeds appear well dispersed, lightly sprinkled evenly through the mixture, not densely packed. The chia seeds layer thickness is thin, likely less than 0.5 cm when isolated. Estimating the volume occupied by the chia seeds in the mixture is challenging because they are dispersed and mixed with other ingredients. Assuming a light to moderate amount mixed in typical proportions: chia seeds average density is about 0.7 g/cm³. Visually, the chia seeds would represent a small fraction by volume, approx 10-15 ml or less (1-1.5 tablespoons). 1 tablespoon of chia seeds is around 12 grams. Given the visual dispersion and total volume, the weight of chia seeds in this bowl is approximately 10 grams. This aligns with typical recipe amounts for chia seeds added to cereals or yogurt. The estimate is plausible and consistent with volume and density considerations, and the scale of the bowl as an anchor. Therefore, 10 grams is a reasonable weight estimate for the 'graines de chia' in the image."
p96w4a,flocon d'avoines,13.0,15,2.0,0.003205128205128205,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/c0fc63a2-21db-448b-875a-c736a595bd0a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'flocon d'avoines' (oat flakes), which are the light beige small flakes on the right side of the white bowl. To estimate the weight, I use the bowl as a scale anchor. Typical small cereal bowls have a diameter of about 15-18 cm. The flakes cover roughly half the bowl floor in an irregular mound about 1-2 mm thick since flakes lie quite flat. Given the sparse but not deep distribution, the volume is quite small, likely about 20-25 cm² surface area times approximately 0.1-0.2 cm thickness equals about 2-5 cm³ volume. Oat flakes have a bulk density around 0.35-0.45 g/cm³ depending on compactness. Multiplying volume by density gives roughly 1-2 grams, but visually the quantity looks closer to a single small handful worth approximately 15-20 grams. Given the visible coverage and typical serving sizes that align visually with what is shown, the more reasonable estimate is about 15 grams, which matches a light cereal portion but not a heaped serving. This fits typical Swiss portion sizes for dry oats and matches the container scale estimation. Therefore, a final estimate of 15 grams is reasonable and consistent with both visual volume and bulk density principles."
p96w4a,beurre,3.0,5,2.0,0.0007396449704142012,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/a11463a4-ab51-4b83-a55f-d4edfb527b13,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I identify the beurre (butter) on the plate: it is the small rectangular shaped piece near the top right of the plate. To estimate its weight, I use the standard white plate as a scale anchor. A typical dinner plate diameter is about 26 cm. The butter portion measures approximately 3.5 cm long and about 1.5 cm wide, with a height roughly around 1 cm based on its visible thickness relative to the knife blade and fork handle nearby. This gives a volume of approximately 3.5 cm × 1.5 cm × 1 cm = 5.25 cm³. Butter density is about 0.9 g/cm³. Multiplying, 5.25 cm³ × 0.9 g/cm³ yields about 4.7 grams. Considering slight irregularities and the possibility of a bit more thickness hidden in the profile, rounding to about 5 grams is reasonable. This aligns well with typical small butter servings seen in Swiss contexts, which usually range from 5 to 10 g for a similar visual size."
p96w4a,oeuf,29.0,28,1.0,0.0035749506903353058,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/4e021399-8a90-44fe-b06c-0955cd2280f7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'oeuf' (egg), which appears as a halved hard-boiled egg on the plate. To estimate its weight, I start by noting the plate size: the typical dinner plate rim is about 26 cm in diameter, and this plate looks standard. The half egg takes up roughly 1/6th of the plate's diameter in length, consistent with a medium-sized egg. A whole hard-boiled egg typically weighs between 50 and 60 grams in Switzerland. Since only half the egg is visible, the weight should be about half that of a whole egg, approximately 25 to 30 grams. The egg's yolk appears fully cooked and dense, and the white portion is firm, matching typical densities for boiled eggs. Given the visible portion is about half the egg, the best estimate is around 28 grams. This fits well within typical Swiss egg sizes and matches the visual proportions on the plate. Therefore, the estimated weight of the visible half egg (oeuf) is 28 grams."
wrah5h,pain,51.0,50,1.0,0.00628698224852071,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/69327bb9-2361-4486-bea2-300691e60d0a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'pain.' The bread piece in the image appears to be a portion of a rustic or country-style loaf, roughly 10 cm long and 5 cm wide as referenced by the visible section of the plate— a fairly standard small plate diameter is about 20-22 cm. The bread shows an average thickness of about 3-4 cm. These dimensions suggest a volume roughly 10 cm x 5 cm x 3.5 cm = 175 cm³. Considering typical density for such bread (~0.3 g/cm³), we get an estimated weight of 175 x 0.3 = 52.5 g. Visually, the bread has some crust and air holes typical of country bread, aligning well with this density estimate. The caviar d'aubergines (aubergine spread) weight is excluded because the task is to estimate the bread only. Therefore, the final estimate for this slice of bread is about 50 grams, rounded slightly for simple reporting and minor visual uncertainties."

The specified food item is 'salade' (salad). Visually, the salad portion is on the right part of a standard dinner plate. The plate rim diameter appears around 26 cm, which is a typical size for a Swiss dinner plate and gives a good scale reference. The salad portion itself covers roughly a small area about 6 cm by 5 cm, and has a modest height, likely around 1.5 cm due to the leafy structure and the visible toppings. Estimating volume approximately as a flattened irregular shape, it's roughly 6*5*1.5 = 45 cm³. Considering the density of mixed salad greens with some vinaigrette and small ingredients, a typical density would be between 0.2 and 0.4 g/cm³ since it is leafy and moisture-heavy but light. Using an intermediate density of 0.3 g/cm³, the estimated weight is 45 * 0.3 = 13.5 grams. Considering the small pile and the visible moistness and dressing, about 13-15 grams is a reasonable estimate. Also, comparing to typical salad side servings in Switzerland, which often range from 10 to 30 grams for a small side salad, this portion is on the smaller side, confirming the estimate. Therefore, I estimate the salade portion to weigh about 14 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread on a standard white ceramic plate, which typically measures about 26 cm in diameter. The bread appears to be rustic or country-style, which tends to be denser and heavier than airy sandwich bread. The slices are roughly 12-14 cm long and about 7-8 cm wide. A typical slice of such bread from a rustic loaf weighs approximately 40-45 grams. The butter (beurre) spread is visible on the top slice in a medium-thin layer with some small butter globules, and a similar amount is visible in the Nutella-spread slice. The quantity of butter covering the top slice corresponds to about a standard thin to moderate spread of about 5 grams to 7 grams (approximate density and typical teaspoons). Considering only the butter quantity on the slice with beurre, and ignoring the Nutella slice's butter content as it is not asked, the visible butter layer weighs around 6 grams. The plate and bread slices provide reliable scale anchoring and the butter spread thickness is moderate without heavy heaping. Cross-checking with typical spread portion sizes in Swiss dietary contexts affirms this estimate. Therefore, the estimated weight of the beurre (butter) visible is about 6 grams."

The specified food is a ""barre de chocolat kinder"" visible in the image. The chocolate bar is placed on a wooden surface with visible wood grain and groove lines that can be used as a size reference. Typical boards or furniture wooden grooves are about 0.8 to 1 cm wide. The bar appears to be a standard Kinder Chocolate bar, which generally measures approximately 9 cm in length and about 2 cm in width. The thickness appears standard for a Kinder chocolate bar, roughly about 1 cm. Based on this, the volume can be roughly estimated as 9 cm × 2 cm × 1 cm = 18 cm³. Kinder Chocolate bars typically have a density close to regular milk chocolate, roughly about 1.2 g/cm³, giving an estimated weight of 18 cm³ × 1.2 g/cm³ = 21.6 g. Known packaging and nutritional information confirm a standard Kinder Chocolate bar of this size weighs around 20 g. This matches well with the estimate, making 20 g a very plausible estimation for the visible chocolate bar."
2ahgvr,crème de marrons,13.0,13,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/6b1cc73c-e22b-4132-970e-e37910b8b407,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a piece of bread with chestnut cream (crème de marrons) spread on top. To estimate the weight of the crème de marrons, we first estimate the size of the bread slice. The bread piece seems to be roughly 10 cm long and about 4 cm wide, similar to a small torn portion of a baguette slice. Bread density is low, approximately 0.3 g/cm³, so this piece of bread could weigh approximately 15-20 g. The chestnut cream spread on top covers the entire top surface of the bread piece in a layer about 2-3 mm thick at most. The area covered is about 40 cm² (10 cm x 4 cm), so the volume of the crème de marrons is roughly 8 to 12 cm³ (40 cm² x 0.2 to 0.3 cm thickness). The chestnut cream is dense, roughly 1.3 g/cm³ (similar to sugar spread or jam). Multiplying volume by density: 8 to 12 cm³ x 1.3 g/cm³ = around 10 to 16 g. This fits with the visual impression: a thin but generous spread on this small piece of bread. Therefore, estimating the crème de marrons weight as about 13 g is reasonable and fits well within typical portion sizes. The other piece of bread with crème de marrons is smaller, and the total crème de marrons visible is still close to this figure, so 13 g is a fair estimate for the crème de marrons portion shown."
2ahgvr,toast,55.0,55,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/feb15752-d5e3-4f73-8eeb-9fb560cc6f6b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'toast'. There are two slices of toasted brown bread on a white plate. The plate can be assumed to be a standard dinner plate, approximately 26 cm in diameter, which helps establish scale. Each slice of toast is roughly square, about 10 cm by 10 cm, a common size for pre-sliced standard bread. A typical slice of pre-sliced brown bread weighs around 25-30 grams before toasting. Toasting reduces moisture but does not significantly affect weight for estimation purposes here. The toast is of medium thickness, not exceptionally thick or thin. There is some fromage frais spread on the toast, but the weight of the spread is excluded as the item to estimate is only 'toast'. Hence, the weight estimate can be based solely on the bread slices. Since two slices are present, the total weight estimate for both would be about 50-60 grams, so for just one slice, around 25-30 grams. Given that the question is about the total toast shown (two slices), the total is approximately 55 grams. This aligns well with a density and volume sanity check, considering the thickness and size of the toast. Therefore the best estimate of the combined weight of the two slices of toast visible in the image is 55 grams."

The specified food item is œuf dur (hard-boiled egg). Visually, two halves of a hard-boiled egg are present on the plate. The plate is a standard dinner plate, which typically measures about 26 cm in diameter, and the knife and fork alongside it have standard sizes (knife approx. 20 cm, fork approx. 19 cm). The halves of the egg appear to be from one whole medium-sized egg. A typical medium-sized Swiss egg weighs about 50-60 grams including shell, and when hard-boiled, the edible portion is close to 50 grams after removing the shell. Visually, the size and volume of the egg halves correspond to one medium egg. There is no reason to estimate a different size because the egg halves look normal-sized and aligned with standard dinnerware scales. Therefore, the weight of the œuf dur on the plate is estimated at 50 grams."

The item to estimate is a 'barre de chocolat kinder,' visually identified as a Kinder Chocolate bar placed on a wooden surface. The bar length is approximately the width of one wooden plank segment which based on typical wooden plank widths is about 7-9 cm. A standard Kinder Chocolate bar in Switzerland typically weighs 21 grams for a single portion bar (usually about 8 pieces). Given the visible size and typical known size from Swiss retail, this item closely matches a single Kinder Chocolate bar portion. The bar is intact and appears about normal in thickness and volume. No packaging is visible that would change the weight. The estimated weight should reflect the known product weight rather than a purely volumetric or density-based calculation since the weight is standardized. Therefore, the best estimate is about 21 grams."
