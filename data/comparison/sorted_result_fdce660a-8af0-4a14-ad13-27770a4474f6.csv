The image shows a pizza with toppings of mushrooms (champignons), olives, and zucchini (courgettes). There are five slices visible, and the pizza appears to be a thin-crust style. Based on the size of the slices and the visible toppings, the total pizza likely weighs around 400-500 grams. Since the pizza is partially eaten, with about 4/5 of the pizza remaining, I estimate the remaining portion to weigh approximately 400 grams. This includes the crust, cheese, and toppings. The weight of the specified food item, 'pizza champignons, olives, courgettes,' is therefore estimated to be 400 grams."

The scrambled eggs (oeufs brouillés) are located in the top left section of the plate. They appear to be a moderately sized portion, spread out but not overly thick. Based on the visual comparison with the gnocchi and cauliflower, the eggs likely weigh less than the gnocchi but more than the cauliflower. Scrambled eggs are relatively dense, and the portion size here seems to correspond to approximately 2-3 medium eggs. A single medium egg typically weighs about 50 grams when cooked. Therefore, the total weight of the scrambled eggs is estimated to be around 120 grams."

The image shows a jar containing a mixture of ingredients, including visible chia seeds distributed throughout the yogurt and oat mixture. Chia seeds are small and dense, and their weight is significant relative to their volume. Based on the size of the jar and the distribution of chia seeds, it appears that approximately 10-15% of the jar's contents are chia seeds. Assuming the jar holds around 250 grams of total content, the chia seeds would weigh approximately 25-35 grams. Considering the density and the visible amount, I estimate the weight of the chia seeds to be 30 grams."
