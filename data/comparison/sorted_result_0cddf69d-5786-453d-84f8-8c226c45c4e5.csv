p8a2w5,dahl de lentille,281.0,500,219.0,6.6036055370747935,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/5ddea52e-8411-4822-893f-d8420fa6cb40,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'dahl de lentille' which appears orange with visible lentils, chunks of carrots, and possibly onions mixed in a thick sauce. It occupies about half of a medium-sized white bowl, with the other half consisting of visible white rice grains. The bowl diameter is roughly 15 cm judging by the fork and laptop in the background. The depth of the bowl is estimated to be around 6-7 cm, and the dahl fills the bowl halfway vertically, so around 3-3.5 cm in height. Considering the mixed nature of the dish with cooked lentils, vegetables, and tomato-based sauce, it has a dense but moist texture. Based on this, the volume of the dahl portion is approximately half the bowl volume: π * (7.5 cm radius)^2 * 3.5 cm height ≈ 620 cm³. Estimating the density of cooked dahl at about 0.95 g/cm³ due to moisture and legumes, this equates to roughly 590 grams. Given some visual air gaps and conservative estimation, I reduce it to approximately 500 grams. Since the target is the 'dahl de lentille' only (not rice), this is the best visual weight approximation from the image evidence."
xjvrtk,ananas,200.0,370,170.0,3.6484601352076402,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/b41068f9-5a0e-4c11-bf1b-7389d3917889,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a blue plate containing 13 pieces of cut pineapple (ananas). Each piece is triangular with visible thickness of about 2-3 cm, and an average length of about 5-6 cm, based on comparison with the plate size which is a standard dinner plate of approximately 25-27 cm diameter. The pieces are solid, dense fruit without visible cores, with consistent size but some variation. Pineapple is moderately dense, juicy fruit. Assuming each piece weighs roughly between 25-35 grams considering their volume and density, the total estimated weight for the 13 pieces is approximately between 325 and 455 grams. Being conservative and avoiding overestimation, I estimate the total weight of the pineapple pieces to be about 370 grams."
xjvrtk,tonic au gingembre,200.0,75,125.0,2.682691275887971,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/c70f93c3-23cc-4817-bbe9-93091771b273,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a glass bottle labeled 'GINGER' with a small amount of clear liquid inside. The bottle appears to be a standard tonic or soda glass bottle, likely between 200ml and 250ml in total capacity. The bottle is roughly one-third full, suggesting the liquid volume inside is about 70-80 ml. Since the density of tonic or soda water is close to that of water, 1 ml roughly corresponds to 1 gram. Therefore, the weight of the tonic au gingembre liquid in the bottle is approximately 75 grams. I have excluded the bottle weight as instructed and based the estimation solely on the liquid volume visible and bottle fill level."
xjvrtk,tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe,250.0,130,120.0,3.2192295310655648,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/f607625b-a07d-423e-a564-4d96ebadf084,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single slice of tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe on a medium-sized plate, covering about half of the plate's surface area. The slice is roughly triangular with a thin crust, visibly about 3-4 mm thick. The topping layer consists of numerous small diced pieces of rhubarb and apple, lightly browned, dispersed evenly over a creamy base. The thickness of the topping is relatively shallow, approximately 1-1.5 cm. The crust is thin and dense but light in weight compared to the moist fruit topping. Given the density of the cooked rhubarb and apple (which retain moisture but are not very dense) and the creamy base, the overall density is moderate. The thickness totals roughly 1.5-2 cm when including crust. The slice is about 14-15 cm in length on the longest side and roughly 12 cm wide at the base. Considering these dimensions and density, and applying conservative downward corrections for the thin crust and relatively light fruit topping, the weight of this single slice is approximately 130 grams."
xjvrtk,courgette et oignons,300.0,185,115.0,3.7021139607254,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'courgette et oignons' located in the left half of the glass container. Visually, the courgette (zucchini) and onions are chopped into medium-sized pieces: roughly 2-3 cm segments for courgette slices and thinly sliced onions mixed throughout. The portion fills about half the container on that side with some layering evident but not piled high—the depth appears to be roughly 2.5-3 cm given the container's shape. Using the container as a scale reference, which is around 12-15 cm wide based on typical lunch containers, the volume of the courgette and onions portion approximates to about 12 cm (length) x 7 cm (width) x 2.5 cm (height) = approximately 210 cm³. Considering cooked courgettes and onions have a density close to water (around 0.9 g/cm³), the weight would be close to volume in grams but slightly less due to cooking water content evaporated. Thus, a conservative estimate would be about 180-190 grams. Allowing for some moisture loss and the presence of onions, I estimate the 'courgette et oignons' weight to be approximately 185 grams."
wrah5h,polenta,209.0,320,111.0,2.4894301963730014,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/f727ac79-973e-4b92-8f2b-cda94222d4a7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is polenta, located on the right side of the container under a pile of shredded cheese. It is a dense, creamy appearance food forming a base underneath the cheese layer. The portion of polenta visible covers roughly a third of the rectangular container base, and appears to be about 5 cm thick. Given the container's inner width inferred by comparing to the known rim and handle size, I estimate the polenta's surface area at about 10 cm x 7 cm and thickness at 5 cm, giving a volume of approximately 350 cubic centimeters. Polenta is dense but slightly softer than pure solids, with a cooked density around 1 g/cm3. Taking the cheese topping as light and shredded without adding bulk weight to polenta itself, I focus only on the base portion. Given some compression visible but considering the shape and density, the weight is likely around 350 grams but factoring slight air content and soft texture, I reduce this to about 320 grams. This is a substantial portion but consistent with the visual size and density of the polenta base in the container."
p8a2w5,yogourt industriel à l'abricot avec morceaux,171.0,280,109.0,2.0001073076510356,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/e4f800da-c429-4a04-823c-ac3792f64c00,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'yogourt industriel à l'abricot avec morceaux.' Visually, it is served in a white bowl placed on a wooden surface. The yogurt fills roughly half to two-thirds of the bowl's depth. The bowl is medium-sized, which I estimate to have a diameter of about 12-14 cm. The yogurt surface is smooth but thick, indicating it is a creamy industrial yogurt with visible small pieces of apricot within. The depth of yogurt visible is approximately 3-4 cm considering the bowl's inner curvature and the yogurt's surface level. The apricot pieces appear small and sparse, embedded within the yogurt, not significantly increasing bulk. Considering yogurt density is close to water but slightly thicker, approximately 1.03 g/ml, and factoring in the estimated volume (cylindrical approximation: π × 6.5^2 cm × 3.5 cm ≈ 465 cm³), but noting the bowl is not completely full and the yogurt does not occupy full bowl width, I reduce volume estimate to roughly 250-300 ml of yogurt. Multiplying volume by density gives a range 250-310 grams. Given the yogurt is creamy yet moderate volume, I estimate toward the mid-value. Therefore, estimating the weight of the yogurt alone at approximately 280 grams seems reasonable, excluding container weight and based strictly on visual evidence."
2ahgvr,porridge salé,48.0,150,102.0,0.5253782594699002,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a35f3211-3b33-4826-97b8-3af69655dada,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small glass jar containing a portion of porridge salé. The jar has a diameter of about 70mm as indicated on the lid, which provides a precise reference for scale. The porridge fills approximately 70-75% of the jar's height. The jar appears roughly cylindrical with a slight curve, and the porridge has a creamy, thick consistency with visible individual oats swollen in liquid. The fill level suggests a volume of around 150-180 ml. Considering the density of cooked porridge (aggregated oats and liquid), which is moderately dense but not as heavy as pure solids, the weight should be close but slightly less than the volume in grams. Given the volume estimation and density, the porridge likely weighs about 140-160 grams. Adjusting conservatively for any headspace or air bubbles and the creamy texture, I estimate the weight of the porridge salé in the jar to be approximately 150 grams."
8japfq,ratatouille,196.0,95,101.0,2.124262259899131,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/b6659a8f-25e7-44f7-a351-7873f60f1586,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The ratatouille is located at the top right section of the plate. It consists of visible diced vegetables (eggplant, zucchini, tomato) in a cooked, stewed form with a moist texture. The portion occupies roughly a quarter of the plate in area, appearing as a compact mound with some depth. Visually, the ratatouille volume is approximately the size of a small fist, estimating roughly 1.5 cm thickness on average. The plate diameter suggests a portion diameter for the ratatouille of about 9 cm. Based on this, the ratatouille portion size resembles roughly 120 ml in volume. Considering the cooked vegetable density typical in stewed dishes (about 0.8 g/ml), the estimated weight is 120 ml * 0.8 g/ml = about 96 grams. Accounting for minor air pockets and the glossy stewed texture, I round this conservatively to 95 grams for this specific serving."
wrah5h,betterave,65.0,165,100.0,0.6974997317308724,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/bba5cf64-1d08-40cb-bc6c-bfdd2a7c2116,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is betterave (beetroot). The image shows a blue plate with several sections of food including quinoa, beetroot, mango, cucumber, tomato, and avocado. The beetroot is located on the top left side of the plate, cut into medium-sized cubes. I count roughly 12 visible pieces of beetroot, and they have a dense, solid texture consistent with cooked beetroot. Each cube appears about 2.5 cm per side, considering size comparison to the tomato slices and the quinoa grains. The pieces are stacked single layer, with no visible hidden layers beneath. The beetroot cubes appear moist but firm. Given beetroot's density (around 0.9 g/cm³) and size, each cube likely weighs around 15 grams. Multiplying 12 cubes by 15 grams gives about 180 grams, but accounting for some variation and spacing between pieces, a conservative estimate is around 165 grams. This aligns with typical serving sizes for cooked beetroot visible on a plate. Therefore, the estimated weight for the betterave on this plate is 165 grams."
m4egh2,pâtes,138.0,50,88.0,1.3031441141753406,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/32c03d9e-2971-4f4b-bbec-4efde05dbf93,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'pâtes' (pasta). In the image, the pasta is visible as a small mound under and around the mushroom sauce, occupying roughly a quarter of the plate's visible surface. The plate is a standard dinner plate, approximately 25-27 cm in diameter, providing a size reference. The pasta appears to be tagliatelle or fettuccine-like ribbons, cooked and lightly coated. Visually, the pasta pile is about 8-10 cm across and has a moderate thickness, approximately 2-3 cm in height due to layering, indicating some depth and volume. The pasta is not densely packed but spread loosely with some gaps. The mushroom sauce overlays part of the pasta, but the pasta shape and width provide clues to volume. Considering pasta's density when cooked (approximately 140-160 g per 100 cm³), the volume on the plate translates roughly to 40-60 grams of pasta. The portion is not large or piled high, and some pasta pieces extend loose on the plate edges but the total mass seems moderate. Given the visual evidence and accounting for potential overestimation due to visibility of sauce and loose arrangement, a conservative estimate for the weight of the pasta is 50 grams."
p96w4a,délice tomate mozzarella,54.0,140,86.0,0.49833673140894946,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/5ebafbd6-315d-44a6-8508-ba143d23adb2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'délice tomate mozzarella'. Visually, it consists of alternating slices of tomato and mozzarella arranged in a vertical line on the plate. There are 7 visible slices each of tomato and mozzarella, layered one after the other. Each tomato slice is roughly 1 cm thick and about 6 cm wide, with a curved, relatively flat shape. The mozzarella slices are similar in size and thickness to the tomato slices, but appear denser. The height/depth of the slices is about 4-5 cm judging from the thickness and the shape of the slices in the cross section. The entire length of the stack is approximately 15-16 cm. The mozzarella's density is higher than tomato, but both are relatively soft and lightly dense foods. For tomatoes, a slice of this size would be approximately 15-18 grams, while mozzarella slices would be around 20-25 grams due to higher density. Multiplying by 7 slices each yields roughly 120 grams tomato and 160 grams mozzarella. Given the even layering and small size corrections for the slices and some air space between, a reasonable estimate is 140 grams total for the combined 'délice tomate mozzarella' dish portion. The balsamic and herbs add negligible weight and are not included. Depth and hidden portions are accounted for by counting all visible slices. This estimate aligns with the typical serving size and visible volume in the image without overestimation."
ppf8hc,pâtes carbonara,236.0,150,86.0,2.17791608541689,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/4d4e6539-b86f-4019-b2aa-0c15dbce0667,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a white plate with a serving of pâtes carbonara topped with grated gruyère cheese. For the pâtes carbonara, I see a mix of penne and conchiglie pasta shapes, moderately coated with a creamy sauce and small pieces of pancetta or bacon. The quantity of pasta seems to cover about a quarter of the plate surface, with an estimated area roughly 12 cm by 8 cm and an approximate thickness of 1.5-2 cm, taking into account the pasta layering and sauce. The pasta density is moderate to high because cooked pasta is compact and denser than it looks due to water absorption. Typical cooked pasta density is about 1 g/cm³. I estimate the pasta volume to be around 150 cm³, resulting in about 150 grams of carbonara pasta with sauce and meat. The grated gruyère cheese is piled on top, appearing to cover roughly a circular patch of about 6 cm diameter and piled about 0.5 cm thick. Grated cheese has lower density due to air gaps but still has a density close to 0.8 g/cm³. Volume is about pi*(3 cm)^2*0.5 cm ≈ 14 cm³, giving roughly 11 grams of grated cheese. Since the target food is only pâtes carbonara, I exclude the cheese weight from the final count. Hence, the estimated weight of the pâtes carbonara portion on the plate is approximately 150 grams."
wrah5h,gaufre à la patate douce,85.0,170,85.0,0.7752977787316235,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1876b0b6-568d-4583-8186-073df252e6c9,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'gaufre à la patate douce' (sweet potato waffle). In the image, there are four pieces of waffle on a plate. These pieces appear thick, roughly square-shaped, each about 6-7 cm wide, and approximately 1.5-2 cm thick based on the visible depth. The waffles have a dense texture typical for sweet potato-based batter, not very porous or airy. Comparing to the plate size and the other foods visible (smoked salmon slices on top), each piece is roughly quarter size of a standard waffle, indicating a total waffle portion made up of roughly one full waffle divided into four parts. Each piece weighs around 40-45 grams when considering density and thickness, resulting in an estimated total weight of about 160-180 grams for all pieces combined. Since only the waffle is targeted and not the toppings or sauce, the estimated weight is based solely on the waffle base visible. I estimate the total weight of the 'gaufre à la patate douce' to be approximately 170 grams."
wrah5h,"délice des dieux (biscuit, fruits rouges, séré+mascarpone)",205.0,126,79.0,1.7378474085202276,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/5de398c7-684b-448d-ba0a-f318d009bccd,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. STEP 1: VISUAL IDENTIFICATION - The target food 'délice des dieux' is a rectangular slice of dessert on a small plate. It consists of a biscuit base soaked with fruit juices, topped with a white creamy layer (seré+mascarpone), and decorated with fresh red fruits including 2 raspberries and 2 blueberries visible on top. The dessert is cut with a slightly uneven edge but roughly flat on top. STEP 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS - The plate diameter appears to be around 18 cm (standard small dessert plate size). The slice covers about 1/4 to 1/5 of the plate surface, roughly 8 cm by 7 cm in visible footprint. Thickness appears moderate: the biscuit base is about 1 cm thick, the creamy layer about 1.5 cm thick, for a total thickness around 2.5 cm. The fruits on top add minimal thickness. STEP 3: DENSITY CONSIDERATIONS - Biscuit base soaked with fruit juice is moist but less dense than dry biscuit. The creamy layer (seré+mascarpone) is creamy but moderately dense. The berries are light per volume. STEP 4: PORTION SIZE CALIBRATION - Estimated volume is 8 cm × 7 cm × 2.5 cm = 140 cm3. Considering mix of densities, roughly average density near 1 g/cm3 (close to water but slightly denser because of cream). Adjusting down slightly for air and less dense structure, effective density might be around 0.9 g/cm3. So estimated weight 140 × 0.9 = 126 grams. STEP 5: CROSS-VALIDATION - This weight fits well within expected range for a dessert slice of this size. It is not overly thick or thin, and the fruit topping weight is minimal. STEP 6: FINAL ERROR-PREVENTION CHECK - Estimate under 200 g; proportions and fruit quantity fit with 125-130 g. No overestimation risks found. Therefore, I confidently estimate the weight of this slice of 'délice des dieux' at about 126 grams."
wrah5h,fondant au chocolat maison,73.0,150,77.0,0.6031763064706513,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1be13f84-6a0b-4b1c-bff5-fc0a0fcf87b8,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single slice of homemade fondant au chocolat on a white plate. The slice is triangular, about 14-15 cm in length from tip to crust edge, based on the relative size compared to the coffee cup handle nearby. The width at the crust side is about 7-8 cm. The thickness of the slice is approximately 3-4 cm, judging by the side profile. The cake surface shows a cracked crust, typical of a dense and moist chocolate fondant. The texture appears dense rather than airy, indicating a concentration of chocolate and butter. Given the dense pastry and moderate thickness, the weight should reflect a compact piece rather than a light one. Standard dense chocolate cake or fondant slice of this size typically ranges around 120 to 170 grams depending on thickness and moisture content. Given the visual evidence, I estimate this slice weighs approximately 150 grams, balancing the moderate thickness, density, and size."
2ahgvr,salade grecque,315.0,240,75.0,2.5351432557141322,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/c476a6d0-acb2-45fd-b168-84822bc98003,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'salade grecque,' which is visible inside a rectangular white plastic container. The salad comprises small diced pieces of vegetables such as cucumber, tomato, yellow pepper, and possibly some onion rings, black olives, and small crumbles of white cheese, likely feta. The portion fills roughly half to two-thirds of the container, which seems to be a small to medium food storage container approximately 12 cm wide and 8 cm high judging by the relative size of the tableboards and other visible items. The diced pieces are about 1 to 1.5 cm cubes, tightly packed with visible dressing coating them. The depth of the salad in the container is at least 4 to 5 cm, allowing some volume beneath the surface. Considering the density of chopped vegetables mixed with a bit of cheese and olives (which are denser), and accounting for some air gaps and dressing liquid, the overall density can be considered medium. A comparable volume of about 500 cubic centimeters (assuming 12x8x5 cm in volume of salad) would weigh approximately 350-400 grams if dense, but this salad is less dense, with chopped raw vegetables and some cheese and dressing, so the weight would be less, roughly 60-70% of the volume weight in grams. Therefore, estimating around 220-280 grams is reasonable. Since the container is not full and there is some empty space above, adjusting conservative, I estimate the salad weight at 240 grams."
p96w4a,purée de pdt,214.0,140,74.0,1.6993239617984763,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/828972fc-fa12-4270-a960-fc59367fc91e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is purée de pdt (mashed potatoes). Visually, the mashed potatoes occupy a flattened mound in the center of the plate under the meat and some sauce, roughly rectangular and about 10 cm long, 7 cm wide, and approximately 2 cm thick. The plate is a standard dinner plate (about 27 cm diameter), which helps scale the portion size. The mashed potatoes have smooth texture and moderate density typical to mashed potatoes. Since the purée is partly covered by meat and sauce, I consider some portion underneath the meat hidden, adding volume. The depth of approximately 2 cm with this surface area suggests a volume around 140 cubic centimeters. Mashed potatoes have a density close to 1 g/cm3, so the weight is roughly 140 grams. Given some margin for hidden volume and variability in density, I estimate the purée de pdt weight to be about 140 grams."
p96w4a,chili,191.0,265,74.0,1.516686339736023,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/58f82c5a-4b79-4f95-9f8f-0b55a93d8383,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is chili. Visually, the chili occupies about half of the plate surface, spread in a relatively even layer. The chili contains visible chunks of cervelas sausage cut into medium-sized cubes, red kidney beans, and a thick reddish sauce. The chunks of cervelas are roughly 2-3 cm each in size, and there are approximately 12-15 visible chunks on the surface. The kidney beans are densely packed around and between the chunks. The chili looks moist and thick but not overly liquid. The plate appears to be a standard dinner plate, approximately 25 cm in diameter, which helps in scaling volume. The chili layer thickness appears uniform and around 2 to 3 cm when estimating from the volume and density of the sausage pieces and beans. The density of chili with meat, beans, and sauce is relatively high, likely around 1.1 to 1.2 g/cm³. Visually comparing to the pasta portion on the other side, the chili portion is comparable in volume but slightly thicker due to sauce and chunks. Considering the dense bean and meat content, the visible volume roughly corresponds to about 250-280 grams. To avoid overestimation, I select a conservative estimate focused strictly on the visible layer and chunks, accounting also for the moist sauce. Thus, I estimate the weight of the chili portion to be approximately 265 grams."
p96w4a,cervelas,130.0,200,70.0,0.9764996244232214,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/58f82c5a-4b79-4f95-9f8f-0b55a93d8383,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'cervelas', which appears as cubed pieces mixed into the chili on the right side of the plate. I see approximately 10 visible chunks of cervelas, with an average dimension roughly around 2.5 cm per side each. The cervelas pieces are mixed in a sauce with kidney beans, making the chunks appear dense and slightly large. The chili section itself covers roughly half of the plate and has some thickness, suggesting a dense portion. Compared to the fusilli pasta on the left side, the cervelas is dense meat sausage, so individual pieces are likely heavy for their size, approximately 20-25 grams each. Multiplying 10 pieces by an average of 22 grams results in about 220 grams. However, considering some visual blending with beans and sauce, some chunks likely weigh a bit less and some parts are hidden or mixed in, so a conservative estimate is 200 grams to avoid overestimation. This weight estimate aligns with the total volume and density seen in the chili portion without inflating for sauce weight. Therefore, the estimated weight for cervelas is 200 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread on a white plate. Each slice is roughly rectangular with rounded edges, and the thickness appears to be about 2.5 to 3 cm. Both slices have visible crusts and an aerated crumb structure typical of bread. The slices appear to be of standard homemade or artisanal bread size, with a length around 12 cm and width around 8 cm. Considering the airy structure of the bread and its size compared to the plate, each slice likely weighs around 40 to 50 grams. Since there are two slices, total bread weight is approximately 80 to 100 grams. Adjusting carefully for the visible density and volume without overestimation, I estimate the combined weight of the two bread slices at about 90 grams."

The image shows two distinct slices of dessert on a small plate: a tiramisu on the left and a forêt noir portion on the right. Focusing on the tiramisu slice, it is approximately rectangular and about twice as long as the forêt noir slice. The tiramisu piece measures roughly 10 cm in length, 4-5 cm in width, and about 3.5-4 cm in height based on the visible side and comparison to the plate size. The tiramisu has visible layers of soaked sponge and cream. This dessert is relatively light but creamy and moist, indicating medium density. Given its volume and density considerations, tiramisu portions this size generally weigh around 130-150 grams. Conservatively adjusting for some cream loss and plate moisture, I estimate the weight of the tiramisu slice in the image to be approximately 140 grams."

The target food is ""boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate."" Visually, there are 9 vegetable meatballs on the plate, each about the size of a large walnut or small golf ball. The sauce tomato covering them is moderate, mostly thinly coating the balls rather than pooling heavily. The meatballs have a textured surface and some visible herbs. Compared to the penne pasta, each meatball appears roughly 3.5-4 cm in diameter. Given their density as vegetable meatballs, which tend to be lighter than meat, I estimate each ball to weigh about 25-30 grams. Multiplying by 9 pieces gives a weight range of 225-270 grams. Considering some balls are partially covered and size variance, a slight downward adjustment for estimation accuracy is appropriate. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the vegetable meatballs in tomato sauce to be approximately 250 grams."

The image shows a small salad portion on a decorated plate, consisting of diced cucumber (concombre) and tomato (tomates). The tomatoes are cut into roughly 10 pieces, each about 2-3 cm in size, with visible watery texture and some seeds. The tomatoes are partially mixed with cucumber pieces, with no layering or hidden volume seen. Using the plate for scale, the tomato pieces are small and thin, averaging about 10-12g each due to their watery, low-density structure. Totalling around 10 pieces, the entire tomato portion weighs approximately 110 grams. This estimate considers the visible size, shape, and typical tomato density, with correction for watery content and no visible large hidden volume."

The target food item is kiwi, which is present in the image as multiple cut pieces placed on top of séré maigre in a shallow bowl. I count approximately 20 individual pieces of kiwi, varying slightly in size but mostly small sections from one or possibly two kiwis. Each piece is roughly triangular and about 2-3 cm long. Considering standard kiwi size, a whole medium kiwi weighs around 70 grams. Visually, these pieces correspond to about one whole kiwi fruit, perhaps slightly less given some are smaller edge pieces. The kiwi pieces occupy about half the surface area of the bowl and have some volume but are mostly flat due to how they are cut and arranged. Applying appropriate density for kiwi (moist, medium density fruit), the total weight of the kiwi pieces visible is close to a single medium kiwi. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the kiwi pieces to be 65 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing milk and cereals with some pieces of various sizes including flakes and a few small chunkier bits. The milk fills approximately half the bowl's visible interior height. The cereals appear to be spread evenly in a thin layer on top of and slightly submerged in the milk. The visible cereals cover an area roughly 12-15 cm in diameter but are not piled thickly. Considering the flakes and grain fragments, the cereal layer depth appears thin, about 0.5 to 1 cm thick when accounting for coverage and some sinking into milk. The density of these mixed cereal flakes with some bits of chocolate or similar suggests a light but noticeably dense component compared to pure flakes. Compared to the spoon size (standard teaspoon of about 14 cm handle visible) and bowl size, the total cereal volume is small. Given this visual volume and light density, an estimated weight range for the cereals in this bowl is around 25 to 35 grams. Being conservative and favoring visible evidence, I estimate the cereal weight close to 30 grams."

The target food item is 'dalh de lentilles corail.' In the image, the dalh occupies approximately half of a medium-sized bowl, with the other half filled with white rice. The bowl appears to be a standard size, around 15 cm in diameter. The dalh is a thick mixture with visible lentils, carrot slices, and tomato-based sauce. The layer of dalh looks about 3-4 cm deep, slightly heaped but not overflowing. Considering the density of cooked lentils mixed with vegetables and sauce, which are fairly dense but slightly moist, I estimate the volume of the dalh to be roughly 200-250 milliliters. Given the density of cooked lentils estimated around 0.8-1 g/ml due to the moisture content and veg ingredients, this translates roughly to 200-250 grams. Considering the visual cues and typical portion size in such bowls, and applying caution to avoid overestimation, I estimate the weight of dalh de lentilles corail in this image to be approximately 230 grams."

The target food item is 'poivrons jaune' (yellow peppers). In the image, I can see a whole yellow bell pepper that has been hollowed and stuffed with quinoa and bulgur curry mixture. In addition, there are two distinct slices of the yellow pepper placed on the plate. The whole pepper is approximately 8-10 cm tall and about 7-8 cm in diameter based on visual comparison to the fork in the background, which is a common size for a bell pepper. The pepper pieces are thick, with visible flesh and some slight roasting or cooking evident which slightly reduces water content but those effects are limited. The visual thickness of the pepper slices appears around 1-1.5 cm. Peppers are mostly water with a moderate density, typically around 0.7 g/cm³. Considering the hollowed main pepper is missing its seeds and inner core (not accounted as edible pepper flesh), its mass is mostly the outer wall visible here. The two slices add additional volume but less than the full hollowed pepper. Summing up the approximate pepper flesh volume visually present: about 100-120 grams total if fresh, adjusted down slightly for cooking effect. Based on the visible pieces, the total estimated edible yellow pepper portion here is about 110 grams, which is reasonable and consistent with the size and density observed."

The target food item is 'bout de gruyère'. In the image, there is a single rectangular piece of gruyère cheese placed roughly in the center of the plate. This piece is about as long as half the diameter of the plate and appears to be a standard rectangular cheese cut. Its thickness seems consistent with a typical slice of firm cheese, approximately 1.5 to 2 cm thick, judging by the visible side and the height relative to other items on the plate like the carrot sticks and radishes. The width appears to be about 2.5 cm. Considering the density of firm cheese like gruyère, which is approximately 1.1 grams per cubic centimeter, we can estimate volume by approximating dimensions: length ~12 cm, width ~2.5 cm, thickness ~1.8 cm, resulting in a volume around 54 cm3. Multiplying by cheese density (~1.1 g/cm3) gives approximately 60 grams. Given a slight margin of visual estimation error and potential rind or irregularities, 60 grams is a reasonable precise estimate for this particular bout de gruyère."

The target food item is 'perle de blé'. In the image, the perle de blé appears as small, round, couscous-like grains with a yellow-orange saffron cream sauce coating some of them. The grains occupy roughly half to two-thirds of the bowl's volume underneath and around the shrimp (crevettes). The bowl itself appears to be a medium-sized plastic bowl approximately 15 cm in diameter judging by the spoon handle visible on the right side and the scale of the beans (haricot coco). The layer of perle de blé is not very thick; it looks like about 2-3 cm deep at most, but there is some depth hidden underneath the top visible layer, considering the grain distribution and the presence of shrimp pieces mixed in. The grains are dense and compact, so the volume corresponds fairly closely to weight. Taking into account the amount visible, the saffron cream contributing some slight density, and the partial mixing with other ingredients, the portion of perle de blé alone weighs roughly around 100 grams. This avoids overestimation from the apparent volume by adjusting for the small size of the bowl and partial coverage by other ingredients. Therefore, the estimated weight for the perle de blé in the bowl is 100 grams."

The image shows a bowl divided between white rice and dalh de lentilles corail. The rice portion occupies roughly half the bowl volume. The bowl appears medium-sized with a diameter around 14-16 cm, suggesting it holds about 300-350 ml of food. The rice is fluffy and fills about half the bowl at a moderate depth, indicating a typical cooked rice density. The surface area of rice is about half the bowl's cross-section, and given usual cooked rice density (~0.96 g/ml) and the space taken, the rice weight appears close to about 150 grams. No dense compacting or unusual spread is visible. The dalh occupies the other half, but since the target food is rice, only rice weight is considered. No visible containers or utensils mislead volume estimation as the spoon rests atop the dalh. Considering all visual cues conservatively, the rice portion is estimated at 150 grams."

The image shows a partially eaten slice of strawberry tart (tarte aux fraises) on a medium-sized plate. The tart slice has a visible number of whole and halved strawberries on top — about 7 distinct strawberry pieces are visible, along with some small red currants partially embedded in the cream layer. The strawberries are medium-sized and denser, typical of fresh fruit. The cream layer beneath the fruit looks thick and creamy, spanning the full thickness of the slice. The tart crust is visible beneath the cream, with some crumbs on the plate, suggesting a thin but brittle base. Size comparison with the plate indicates the slice is roughly 10 cm long, about 5 cm wide at the widest point, and approximately 3.5 cm thick including fruit topping, cream, and crust. Strawberries are dense but lighter than pastry or cream layers. The cream filling appears rich and thick, which adds notable weight, and the pastry base is moderately thin but dense. Considering the overall volume and layered composition, the total estimated weight is around 120-140 grams. I estimate the tart aux fraises in this image to weigh approximately 130 grams based on visual evidence and density considerations."

It appears to be approximately 1.5 to 2 cm thick based on the visible side edges and depth of the pockets. The waffle looks cooked evenly with a golden-brown color and does not appear overly dense or heavy. Waffles typically have a light but somewhat dense texture due to batter and air pockets. Visual comparison to the plate size and typical thickness suggests a moderate density and volume. Considering the thickness and the waffle's size, a typical individual portion weight would be between 70 and 90 grams. Accounting for its light texture but solid structure, I estimate the waffle weighs approximately 80 grams. Only the waffle is considered, excluding the compote on top, and no container weight is included."

The target food item is 'salade de tomates'. In the image, the salad consists of numerous thick tomato slices arranged on a medium-sized plate. There are approximately 14 visible tomato slices, some quartered and some halved, overlapping slightly but not heavily piled. The tomato slices are thick, about 1.5 to 2 cm each, with visible fresh basil leaves scattered on top. The tomatoes look fresh and dense. The plate is a standard dinner plate (approx. 25 cm diameter), which helps to gauge the size of the slices. There is a noticeable drizzle of vinaigre balsamique and a generous sprinkling of graines de lin (flax seeds), but these are minimal in weight compared to the tomatoes. Focusing on the tomatoes only and estimating based on realistic size and density, each slice likely weighs around 30 to 35 grams. Multiplying by the number of slices suggests a total weight between 420 and 490 grams. To be conservative and account for overlap and some thinner slices, I estimate approximately 450 grams total for the 'salade de tomates', excluding vinaigre balsamique and graines de lin."

It appears to be roughly 8 cm long, about 3 cm wide, and about 2.5 cm thick judging by its shape relative to the bread piece and carrot shreds. The avocado wedge is solid and dense, with the skin removed from the visible side. The thickness suggests it's a substantial portion but not a full half avocado. A typical avocado half weighs between 100 to 150 grams depending on size. Considering this is approximately half of a half-avocado wedge, I estimate the weight conservatively. Accounting for visible density and size in relation to other items on the plate, the avocado wedge likely weighs about 60 grams."

The image shows a small green bowl with four whole strawberries inside. The strawberries vary in size, two appearing quite large and two smaller. The strawberries have intact leafy caps. Comparing the strawberries' size to the bowl diameter (which appears to be a small cereal or dessert bowl about 12 cm in diameter), the largest strawberries occupy a significant portion of the bowl base. The strawberries appear dense and fresh, typical density for strawberries is around 0.6-0.7 g/cm3. Estimating size, the two large strawberries are about 6-7 cm long and about 4 cm wide and 3 cm thick, with volumes roughly 50-60 cm3 each, giving about 35-40 grams each by density. The two smaller strawberries are about half that volume, about 20 grams each. Summing these approximations: 2 large strawberries at about 38 g each = 76 g and 2 smaller strawberries at about 20 g each = 40 g, totaling approximately 116 grams. Given these are whole strawberries and fully visible, no hidden volume, this is a reasonable estimate based purely on visual evidence and dimensional analysis."

Comparing it to the bowl size, which appears to be a standard small dessert bowl about 15 cm in diameter, the ice cream scoop is around 5 to 6 cm in diameter. The scoop looks solid but slightly melting, indicating it is dense but not extremely heavy. Vanilla ice cream typically has a density slightly less than water, but an average scoop this size generally weighs about 80-90 grams. There are no other ice cream portions visible and no indication of hollow volume inside the scoop. The chocolate sauce should not be included since the target is 'boule de glace vanille' only. Given the visual size and typical density, I estimate the weight of the vanilla ice cream ball to be approximately 85 grams."

The target food item is 'thon' (tuna) visible inside a transparent rectangular container mixed with couscous and cucumber pieces. Step 1: Visual Identification - The tuna is shredded and spread throughout the container, mixed visibly with chunks of cucumber and couscous grains. Pieces of tuna are small to medium size flakes, visibly lighter pink-beige in color. There appear to be approximately 10 to 15 discernible tuna chunks spread evenly on the top layer. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The container is about 15cm wide and 6cm deep based on typical glass containers. The visible tuna pieces appear 1-3 cm in length and about 0.5-1 cm thick. The total visible tuna volume is roughly estimated to be about 30-40% of the container’s volume considering it is diced and interspersed. The mixture overall fills the container to about 80% capacity. Step 3: Density Considerations - Tuna has a high density and compactness; shredded tuna often weighs around 1g per cm³ roughly. Given the mixed nature with couscous and cucumber, the tuna portion is a fragmented dispersed volume, so the discrete tuna pieces' weight needs to be conservatively estimated rather than overcounted. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Taking the total container size as a reference (~15cm x 15cm x 6cm = 1350 cm³), the tuna portion corresponds to roughly 30-40% of the fill volume, but due to mixing, I estimate tuna volume as approximately 400-500 cm³. Tuna density ~1g/cm³ approximates to 400-500 grams but the fragmentation and mixture means actual tuna is lower. Considering visual dominance of couscous (bulk of the visible volume) and cucumber (water-dense, low weight) mixed with small tuna flakes, I conservatively estimate tuna to be closer to 100-150 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - It would be unlikely visually and portion-wise that the tuna alone weighs more than about 150 grams in this mixed container. The tuna pieces are small and dispersed, and couscous is the main bulk. Step 6: Error-Prevention - The tuna's shredded state and mixture suggests lean heavier density but spatial proportionally limited volume. Final weight estimate is a conservative 130 grams to reflect visual evidence and avoid overestimation. This value balances volume, density, mixture distribution, and total food container capacity."

These two pieces are small, roughly wedge-shaped, with one showing a creamier lighter color and the other a slightly darker rind-like surface. Each piece measures about 3-4 cm in length, 2 cm in width, and around 1.5-2 cm in thickness. Given the typical density of sheep/goat cheese which is semi-firm, these chunks are relatively compact but small. Given their size relative to the slice of baguette and the other cheeses, I estimate each piece weighs approximately 20-25 grams. Combining both pieces, the total weight is roughly between 40 and 50 grams. To be conservative and grounded in the visual evidence, I finalize the estimate at 45 grams."

The image shows a single small container of 'yogourt figue sans sucre' (fig yogurt without sugar). The container is about the size of a standard individual yogurt cup, similar in height and diameter to the fork beside it, which provides a reference scale. The yogurt fills the cup almost to the top with visible yogurt and fig at the bottom. Typically, such individual yogurt portions in Swiss context range around 125g to 150g. Given that the container is filled and the depth looks typical for this packaging size, the estimated weight of the yogurt portion (excluding container) aligns with around 125 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing cereal and milk. The target food is ""cereales,"" which visually consists of multiple clusters of granola-like cereal pieces with some visible small chocolate chunks mixed in. The cereal appears partially submerged in milk. The spoon beside the bowl and the size of the bowl itself provide reference for scale. The cereal pieces vary in size, with an average cluster roughly 2-3 cm in length and a thickness around 0.5 to 1 cm. The cereal depth is thin overall since it is spread out at the bottom of the bowl, with some small clusters and individual pieces visible at the surface and submerged ones underneath. The milk occupies roughly half or more of the bowl volume, so the cereal is not densely packed or piled. Considering cereal density (relatively light but dense clusters with chocolate pieces adding some weight), and visual volume about covering the bowl bottom but shallow depth, I estimate the total cereal volume equates to around 35-45 grams. Applying conservative portion sizing based on the visible quantity and acknowledging the light density of cereal, I estimate the weight of the cereals in this bowl to be about 40 grams."

The target food is 'mais' (corn). On the plate, the corn is located near the bottom center-right side, next to the chickpeas (pois chiches). Visually, the corn portion appears to be spread as a small loose pile, covering a surface roughly 6 cm by 4 cm on the plate. Considering the corn pieces are individual kernels and somewhat layered, the depth is estimated at about 1.5 cm, given their rounded shape and the way they pile up a little. The corn appears cooked and moist, which adds some density compared to raw kernels. For comparison, the plate diameter and the fork nearby establish scale, confirming these rough dimensions. Corn has a medium density with individual kernels weighing about 0.3 grams each, but here the portion is a denser cluster, so direct volume estimation is more reliable. The estimated volume is approximately 36 cm3 (6x4x1.5). Corn density is about 1.1 grams per cm3 when cooked. Multiplying volume and density gives about 40 grams. Given possible slight overestimation of the depth and surface coverage, and visible gaps, I adjust downward slightly to 35 grams. Therefore, the weight of the corn ('mais') on the plate is estimated at 35 grams."

The target food item is 'porc'. In the image, the pork is located in the bottom left corner of the container, underneath a layer of white sauce. It appears to be one single piece, roughly rectangular with slightly rounded edges. The pork piece has an estimated size of about 8 cm in length, 6 cm in width, and about 1.5 cm in thickness, based on comparison with the container width and visible food items nearby such as the polenta mound and eggplant slices. The surface area covered by the pork is less than half of the container base area, and the thickness is relatively thin but solid. The sauce and cheese toppings do not add to the pork weight and are excluded by instruction. Pork is a dense meat, so the volume directly relates to weight without substantial reduction. Estimating volume as 8 cm × 6 cm × 1.5 cm = 72 cm3, and using pork density roughly 1.0 g/cm3 (close to water density), the pork piece weighs about 70–80 grams. Visual thickness could be slightly variable but moderate. Adjusting conservatively downward to account for some cooking shrinkage and visual compression, I estimate the pork weight to be approximately 75 grams. This estimate is consistent with relative portion sizes visible in the image, where the pork piece is moderate but not overly large, fitting the container size and other foods present."

The target food is 'muesli nature.' In the image, the muesli covers the surface of a metal bowl with a light amount of natural yogurt underneath. The muesli layer is approximately 2-3 cm deep based on the visible bowl size and comparison to the spoon handle and the portion of yogurt exposed, which is denser and spread below the granola-like pieces. The volume of the muesli appears to fill roughly half the bowl. Considering the oats, seeds, and nuts density—usually about 0.4 to 0.6 g/cm³ for dry muesli—and the bowl diameter estimated around 12 cm, the total muesli volume could be around 140-160 cm³. Multiplying by an average density of 0.5 g/cm³ gives approximately 70-80 grams. Since the muesli is mostly dry and loosely packed with some clumps, 75 grams is a reasonable estimate. I exclude any yogurt weight as per rules. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'muesli nature' is 75 grams."
p96w4a,houmous au basilic (acheté),34.0,55,21.0,0.07661766283936045,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/fab584a3-42d9-4217-a493-ec0d71878e56,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'houmous au basilic (acheté)' which is served in a clear small glass on the table above the plate. Visually, the glass appears to be a small tumbler, roughly the size of a shot glass or small juice glass, approximately 6-7 cm high and about 5-6 cm wide at the top. The houmous fills roughly two-thirds of the height of the glass, indicating a moderate portion. The texture appears thick and dense, typical of hummus. Considering the volume and the density of hummus, a small glass like this filled to about 2/3 would hold approximately 50-60 grams of houmous. I see no evidence of additional layers or mix-ins affecting weight. There are no visible containers influencing weight, so the estimate is purely for the content. Therefore, my final estimate for the weight of the houmous au basilic is 55 grams, balanced between the small volume and typical density."
2ahgvr,toast,55.0,75,20.0,0.11803841613907072,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/feb15752-d5e3-4f73-8eeb-9fb560cc6f6b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two slices of toasted bread, each spread with a visible layer of fromage frais. The target food item is 'toast,' so I will estimate the weight of the two toast slices without including the fromage frais. Visually, the toast slices appear to be standard sandwich-bread-size, roughly 10 cm by 10 cm each, with a thickness of about 1.2 cm including the crust. The bread has a dense texture visible through the toasting, and there are two separate slices on the plate. Using the plate edge and the knife as reference, the size and volume fit typical crisp toasted bread slices. A single slice of standard toasted sandwich bread typically weighs between 30 and 40 grams. Since there are two slices, the total weight of the toast is approximately between 60 and 80 grams. Being conservative and considering the toast looks slightly dense, I estimate the total weight of the two toast slices at 75 grams."

The target food is 'sauce'. In the image, sauce is the brown liquid spread around the mashed potatoes, meat, and carrots on a white plate. The sauce appears glossy and somewhat thin, pooling around all the other foods and partially soaking the mashed potatoes. It does not form a thick layer but rather a shallow covering. The visible surface area covered by the sauce is roughly 2/3 of the plate surface, but the sauce depth is shallow, estimated visually at about 2-3 millimeters thick around the edges and slightly deeper near the mashed potatoes where it pools more densely. The plate is a standard dinner plate of approximately 24-26 cm diameter, so the sauce covers an area about 15-18 cm in diameter. Considering the thin layer and some pooling, the total volume is likely between 30 to 50 milliliters. Given typical density of brown sauce/gravy is close to 1 g/ml, this results in a weight of about 30 to 50 grams of sauce. To be conservative and prioritize what the image shows, I estimate the weight of the sauce to be approximately 40 grams."

The image shows a rectangular glass container with three distinct food items: ratatouille, bulgur (boulgour), and two halves of a hard-boiled egg (œuf dur). Focusing specifically on the bulgur, it occupies roughly one third of the container space on the lower left side. The bulgur grains are cooked and appear fluffy but dense, with some clumped together forming a layer about 2-3 cm thick, though there are some gaps and air space visible. The container is moderately deep, estimated around 4-5 cm, but the bulgur fills only about half of that depth. Comparing the bulgur portion to the eggs, the two egg halves together would weigh approximately 60 grams (typical hard-boiled egg weight), and the bulgur portion is significantly larger in volume than one egg, roughly 3-4 times bigger in volume. Considering the density of cooked bulgur, which is dense and moist, this portion likely weighs between 130 and 170 grams. Given the visible volume and compactness, I estimate the bulgur weight to be about 150 grams conservatively."

The image shows a single pear ('poire') being held in a person's hand. The pear is fully visible and not cut or missing pieces. It is roughly the size of the person's palm, with a typical pear shape: wider at the bottom and tapering to the top near the stem. Given the hand size as a reference, the pear appears to be medium-sized. The skin is intact and the pear is not visibly shriveled or unusually dense or light. Pears of this size and shape generally weigh between 160 to 200 grams. Considering the visual evidence and typical density of pears, I estimate the weight to be around 180 grams."
r3bub9,fromage,38.0,18,20.0,0.08155381478699432,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/r3bub9/dish_media/b1cddb5b-7db0-4fb4-9340-d84cd4187243,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows an open sandwich with two slices of pain bis (brown bread), spread with mayonnaise on one slice, and topped with strips of fromage (cheese) and two small cornichons (pickles) on the other. The target food item is 'fromage'. Step 1: Visual Identification - The fromage is arranged as 7 rectangular slices placed side by side on one slice of bread. The cheese slices are thin but not paper-thin, each about 1 cm wide and approximately the length of the bread slice (around 10-12 cm). Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each cheese slice is roughly 10 cm long, 1 cm wide, and around 2-3 mm thick, visible by the edge profile on the side. The total surface area of cheese covers most of the slice. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cheese is dense; Swiss-style semi-hard cheese often weighs about 1 g per cm³. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Volume per slice is approximately 10 cm x 1 cm x 0.25 cm = 2.5 cm³ each. For 7 slices, volume is about 17.5 cm³. Given 1 g/cm³ density, weight is roughly 17.5 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - The thickness and size match typical thin cheese slices; this corresponds well with the visual volume and known cheese density. Step 6: Final Error-prevention - The weight estimate is under 200 grams, reasonable for cheese on one sandwich slice. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the fromage at approximately 18 grams."

The image shows a plate with three distinct food items: mozzarella, olives, and mixed green salad. The target food is 'mozarella'. Visually, the mozzarella is a single, smooth, semi-circular piece located on the left side of the plate. It appears moist and fresh with visible liquid around it. The diameter of the mozzarella ball looks to be about 7-8 cm based on comparison with the olives, which are typical olive size (~2-3 cm length). The mozzarella ball is flattened somewhat, with thickness approximately 1.5-2 cm. Considering mozzarella cheese density (about 1.03 g/cm3), I estimate the volume as roughly a half-sphere volume: (4/3)*pi*(3.5 cm)^3/2 ≈ 90 cm3. At a density near 1 g/cm3, this corresponds to approximately 90 grams. This aligns well for a medium single ball of fresh mozzarella. There is no visible layering, hidden parts, or significant deformation to suggest a larger or smaller weight. Therefore, the estimated weight of the mozzarella is 90 grams."

The target food item is 'haricots rouges' (red kidney beans). Visually, the red kidney beans occupy roughly a quarter of the blue plate on the left side. I count approximately 30 large visible individual beans, with no clear layering visible underneath, so I will not assume hidden volumes. Each bean appears plump and cooked, with a shiny appearance indicating moisture content. The beans are roughly 2-3 cm in length. Comparing the beans size to the visible cutlery (fork and knife), and the pasta and other vegetables on the plate, each cooked kidney bean weighs about 2 grams on average. Multiplying 30 beans x 2 grams gives about 60 grams. Considering some variability and that some beans may be smaller or hidden, I add a small 20% buffer for hidden beans or volume, resulting in approximately 72 grams total. Given that red kidney beans are dense and moist, this estimation is reasonable and consistent with the visual evidence provided. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the haricots rouges on the plate to be 72 grams."

The target food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries). In the image, I observe a cluster of blueberries on the left side of the bowl. There are about 10 visible blueberries, some loosely grouped and some scattered slightly. The blueberries appear fresh with a typical round shape and average blueberry size. I compare their size to the hand holding the bowl and the other food items such as raspberries and porridge. Each blueberry is approximately 1.5 to 2 cm in diameter. Blueberries have a known average weight of about 0.5 to 0.7 grams each. Taking a cautious approach based on visual evidence and the count of about 10 berries, I estimate roughly 6 grams total weight for the blueberries. I also consider some small variation but no hidden volume is evident, hence I do not add further weight margins. Therefore, the best conservative weight estimate for 'myrtilles' here is about 6 grams."

The image shows a transparent glass bowl containing chocolate yogurt. The yogurt appears to be a mixture of light and darker chocolate shades, swirled together in an uneven, slightly fluffy mass. The bowl is medium-sized, roughly 12-15 cm in diameter judging by the texture and reflections on the table surface, with the yogurt filling about half to two-thirds of the bowl's volume. The yogurt is not level but piled somewhat irregularly, suggesting some depth and volume. Given the density of yogurt (typically similar to milk in density, close to 1g/cm³), visual estimation depends on volume. The yogurt mass likely fills roughly 150-200 ml in volume, considering there is empty space at the sides and top of the bowl. This suggests a weight in the range of 150-180 grams, as yogurt is heavy and dense compared to airy foods. I apply moderate conservatism in the estimate, leaning lower because the bowl is not full to the brim and the yogurt surface is uneven, using visible evidence rather than full container volume. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the chocolate yogurt to be 160 grams."

The target food item is 'vinaigre,' which is a liquid dressing visible largely as a mustard seed vinaigrette drizzled over the salad. The salad contains chopped tomatoes, shredded carrots, cucumber pieces, pumpkin seeds, and a dollop of sérac. There is no visible container for the vinaigre, only the amount adhering to the salad ingredients. The vinaigre appears as a thin coating over an area roughly the size of half the bowl's surface, but the actual liquid volume is low because it is absorbed and spread thinly. Considering the visible mustard seeds and liquid sheen, the vinaigre likely weighs only a few grams. Given this light coating without pooling or droplets, the vinaigre's weight can be estimated conservatively at about 5 grams."

The image shows a blue translucent bowl held by a hand, with a serving of crème caramel inside. Visually, the crème caramel occupies roughly a circular area about 7-8 cm in diameter in the bowl and has a thick, creamy consistency. The depth visible is about 2-3 cm thick, considering the slight mound shape and texture. The hand holding the bowl gives a size reference: the bowl diameter appears to be around 12-14 cm. The crème caramel portion fills less than half the bowl's depth. Given the density of custard-like desserts (moderate density), the texture appears dense and creamy but not too thick or gelatinous. Estimating volume around 90-120 ml (considering shape), this corresponds approximately to 100 grams of crème caramel, as its density is close to that of water (slightly higher due to sugar and dairy). No visible caramel layer separately, but the amount suggests a modest dessert portion typically served. The visual evidence does not support a very large portion; it is a small to moderate serving. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the crème caramel to be 100 grams."

The image shows four small portions of cheese arranged on a white plate alongside one piece of seeded bread. The cheeses have different colors and textures that likely correspond to manchego, two types of gruyère, and raclette. Each cheese piece appears to be roughly rectangular or triangular in shape with an estimated surface area of about 3-4 square centimeters each. The thickness of each cheese piece seems fairly uniform, around 4-5 millimeters, based on the visible edges. The cheeses are dense solids, so their weight per volume is relatively high. Using the bread piece as a size reference, which is about 7 cm long and 5 cm wide, the cheese pieces are noticeably smaller. Estimating each piece to weigh between 10 and 15 grams due to their size and density results in a total weight around 45 to 60 grams for all four pieces combined. Accounting for slight variation in thickness and density between types, I conservatively estimate the total cheese weight to be approximately 52 grams."

The target food item is 'brochette de boeuf' visible at the top center of the plate. It consists of three sizable chunks of grilled beef on a skewer. Each piece looks roughly cubical with a slightly charred grilled surface. Comparing to the slice of bread (which is about 7-8 cm long) and the penne pasta salad beside it, each beef cube appears around 3 cm per side, with some thickness. Beef is dense and compact. Estimating the volume roughly as 3 pieces × ~3x3x3 cm = 27 cm3 each, total volume is about 81 cm3. Given cooked beef density of approximately 1.1 g/cm3, this yields around 89 grams. Considering some surface charring and slight shrinkage on cooking, and that the chunks are slightly thick and dense, I will round to about 90 grams. This fits visually given the other items on the plate and avoids overestimation."

The target food item is ""purée cacahuète"" (peanut butter puree). In the image, this item appears as a small dollop placed distinctly on the left side of the plate near the oatmeal-like base. Visually, the peanut butter portion is about 4-5 cm in length and 2-3 cm in width, with a visible thickness of about 0.5 cm. Compared to the banana half and the chocolate chips, it is clearly much smaller in volume. Considering typical peanut butter density, which is dense and thick, and the relatively small size of the portion, I estimate the weight of the peanut butter puree to be roughly 20-25 grams. The spread is modest and does not cover a large surface area or pile high, so no extra volume correction is needed."

The image shows a bowl with visible cooked pasta (wide flat ribbons), grilled zucchini slices on the left, and numerous pieces of mushroom covered in a creamy sauce spread throughout the pasta. The target food item is the sauce aux champignons which includes cream, garlic, and mushrooms. Visually, the sauce is thick and creamy, fully coating the mushrooms and also mingling with the pasta, but the item to estimate is only the sauce with mushrooms. The mushrooms are whole or halved slices, about 8 pieces visible on top, medium thick slices, average size approx. 3-4 cm length. The creamy sauce clings mostly to the mushrooms and pasta. Because the estimation excludes pasta and zucchini, only the volume and density of creamy mushroom sauce and visible mushrooms is considered. The mushrooms are dense but moderate in size, and the cream adds volume mainly as liquid but with some thickness. The mushrooms plus sauce occupy about 40-50 ml volume roughly in the bowl, given the bowl diameter (about 14 cm typical) and visible volume occupation. Assuming mushrooms are about 85% water, and cream is dense, the combined density is relatively high. A reasonable estimate for combined weight of the creamy mushroom sauce portion visible is about 100 grams, possibly a bit lower if only the mushroom pieces plus sauce fraction is counted. Considering some sauce is mixed with pasta and some mushrooms are embedded, the total weight for sauce with mushrooms in the bowl is conservatively estimated at 110 grams."

The caviar d'aubergine is the eggplant spread visible on the slice of pain aux graines (seeded bread) at the bottom of the plate. Visually, it covers most of the surface of this slice of bread with a fairly thin but even layer. The bread slice length is about 12 cm and width about 6-7 cm, typical of a standard piece of artisanal bread. The thickness of the spread appears thin, around 2-3 mm at most, judging by the visible texture and the slight translucency of the layer edges. Caviar d'aubergine tends to be quite dense, but the thin spreading reduces the volume. Given these dimensions, the volume of spread is approximately 12 cm × 6.5 cm × 0.25 cm = roughly 20 cm³. Considering the density of cooked eggplant puree is close to water (~1 g/cm³), the weight estimate is therefore about 20 grams with a small margin. I allow 15-25g range but select 20g as a precise estimate based on the thin coverage and moderate spread area visible."

The image shows a single piece of dark chocolate ('chocolat noir') placed on a flat surface. The piece appears to be a broken portion of a larger chocolate bar, with one complete triangle section and part of an adjacent section visible. It has a typical thickness for a chocolate bar, estimated around 0.8 to 1 cm based on the visible side profile. The approximate dimensions of this piece are about 3 cm in length and 2 cm in width. Dark chocolate is dense, so the volume-to-weight ratio is compact. Considering the chip off the edge and the partial piece, the weight is less than a full triangular segment from a standard chocolate bar, which typically weighs about 10-12 grams per full segment. Given this partial piece size and density, a conservative estimate is around 6 grams."

There is only one piece visible, and it is fully exposed with no layering or mixing. The diameter appears to be consistent with a medium-sized banana. Using the visible length and diameter, this piece likely weighs about half of a standard medium banana. A medium banana typically weighs about 120-150 grams intact, so half of it would be roughly 60-75 grams. Given the visual evidence and the density of banana flesh, a conservative and visually grounded estimate for this peeled banana piece is approximately 65 grams."

The texture looks light and fibrous, suggesting a relatively low density, but with some dressing or moisture adding weight. Compared to the potato salad portion next to it, the celery salad is visibly smaller in volume. Considering typical density of celery root salads and the volume shown, the portion likely weighs between 50 and 70 grams. Based on visible size, thickness, and texture, I estimate the celery salad weight to be approximately 60 grams."

The image shows a bowl filled with a mixture of cereals, blueberries, and yogurt. The target food item is ""yogourt orange sanguine,"" which appears to be mixed evenly throughout the cereal and blueberries. Visually, the yogurt is creamy and slightly pinkish, indicating the blood orange ('orange sanguine') flavor mixed with yogurt. The bowl is medium-sized and filled to near its top with this mixture. Given this, the yogurt likely constitutes about half to two-thirds of this mixture by volume, as cereals and blueberries are visibly present but largely embedded in the yogurt. The bowl diameter is roughly comparable to the size of the spoon handle visible, which gives an indication the bowl holds approximately 300-350 grams of total content. Considering the yogurt's density is similar to standard plain yogurt, and it is diluted with cereals and fruit, I estimate the yogurt portion alone to be around 180 grams. This accounts for the fact that cereals and blueberries take space but do not weigh as much as yogurt. Therefore, the best estimate for the ""yogourt orange sanguine"" weight based on visual evidence is 180 grams."

The slices are roughly flat with some thickness visible, each about 6-7 cm long and about 3-4 cm wide, with a thickness around 1-1.5 cm. The tomato pieces are fresh and not heavily cooked, retaining some volume and moisture. The volume is enough to fit the two thick slices occupying roughly a 6x4x1.5 cm space combined, equating to approximately 36 cubic centimeters. Considering tomato density close to water (~1 g/cm3), the total weight is close to 35-40 grams. Adjusting for some air gaps and potential juiciness loss, I estimate the weight to be approximately 37 grams."

The image shows a single lemon slice ('rondelle de citron') floating in a glass of water. The lemon slice is fully visible with a diameter roughly matching the glass opening, which appears to be a standard drinking glass about 7 cm in diameter. The thickness of the lemon slice is thin, approximately 3 to 4 millimeters, as visible from the edge profile under water. Lemons are dense with juicy pulp, but the slice is very thin and flat. Considering the surface area (about 38 sq cm) and thickness, and typical density of lemon (~0.9 g/cm3), the estimated weight is relatively low. There is only one slice, with no overlapping or hidden volume. Therefore, estimating conservatively and accounting for water absorption and peel weight, the weight of the single lemon slice is approximately 8 grams."

The image shows two small baguette sandwiches on a plate. Each sandwich clearly contains a piece of grilled chicken breast, some green lettuce, and a layer of yellow sauce that appears to be the curry mayo sauce. The target food item is the 'sauce curry avec mayonnaise'. Visually, the sauce is spread thinly on the lower halves of the bread of both sandwiches, with a visible thin layer but no large pools or thick dollops. Each sandwich appears to have about a teaspoon to a tablespoon of sauce. Considering the surface area covered and typical condiment thickness, each sandwich likely has about 10-15 grams of sauce. Since there are two sandwiches, the total visible sauce quantity would be roughly 20-30 grams combined. The sauce is not piled or heavily layered, so a conservative estimate is warranted. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the curry mayonnaise sauce visible in the image to be approximately 25 grams."

The image shows a single cookie on a wooden surface. The cookie is round but irregular at the edges, likely homemade or hand-formed, with visible chunks of dark chocolate embedded on the surface. There is only one cookie present. The cookie's diameter appears to be approximately 8 cm, judging by the texture and grain of the wood and typical table/furniture scale; it is moderately thick with some puffiness, about 1.5 cm thick. Its texture looks dense but somewhat crumbly with a moderate amount of chocolate chunks. Cookies of this size and thickness typically weigh between 40 and 60 grams. Considering the visible density and chocolate inclusion, I estimate this cookie weighs about 50 grams."

The target food item is the 'yaourt nature' shown in the image. Visually, this is an opened small white plastic container filled almost to the top with plain yogurt. The yogurt surface is smooth and slightly glossy, indicating it is fresh and unprocessed. There are no visible inclusions or mix-ins. The diameter of the container is roughly the same as the height of the apple next to it, which is a standard small apple. Given standard yogurt container sizes and visual proportions, this pot resembles a typical single-serving yogurt container of approximately 125 grams. There is no visible container overfill or notable air gap, so the yogurt content should be close to the container’s usual filled weight. No pieces are missing or scooped out. Considering the density of plain yogurt (close to water, ~1 g/cm³), visual volume corresponds directly to weight in grams. Therefore, the weight of the 'yaourt nature' is best estimated at 125 grams."

The image shows one peeled carrot laid flat on a speckled countertop. The carrot is whole, without the green tops or other attachments. Its visible length appears to be roughly 15-18 cm based on typical perspective relative to the visible textured surface and shadows. The carrot is fairly thick, with a diameter estimated around 3-4 cm at the thickest part near the base, tapering slightly towards the top. The surface is smooth and peeled, which means the weight is solely of the carrot without skin. Carrots are dense vegetables with a density slightly less than water but substantial enough to give a realistic weight. Considering the length, width, and density, this carrot likely weighs around 90-110 grams. To be conservative and avoid overestimation, I select an estimate towards the middle of the range, approximately 100 grams."

The image shows two small solid chocolate pieces shaped like bunnies placed on a flat surface. The bunnies are of a modest size approximately matching the size of a small treat, likely around 3-4 cm in height judging by visible surface texture and relative scale given the surface patterns. Each bunny appears solid with a typical chocolate density. There are two chocolates but the task is to estimate the weight of one piece. Considering the volume as roughly a small figurine about 3 cm tall and a base about 2 cm wide, and typical milk chocolate density (~1.3 g/cm³), the weight of each bunny is likely between 18 and 25 grams. Given the visual impression and the compactness of the figures, a conservative estimate of about 20 grams per chocolate bunny is reasonable."

The target food item is 'graines de courge' (pumpkin seeds) present in a glass container with a mixed dish of couscous, tuna, and cucumber. Visually, the pumpkin seeds are scattered sparsely throughout the dish, primarily visible as small dark green flat oval shapes roughly 5-8 mm in length. They appear as whole pumpkin seeds rather than crushed or ground. Counting visible seeds on the surface yields approximately 10 to 15 seeds, with the possibility of some hidden among the couscous grains or tuna chunks below the surface. The container is roughly 15 cm wide and filled to about 6-7 cm high with the mixed food, but the pumpkin seeds constitute only a small fraction by volume and count. Each pumpkin seed weighs around 0.5 grams on average when whole. Assuming about 15-20 seeds total accounting for some hidden seeds, the total weight estimate for pumpkin seeds is thus 7.5 to 10 grams. Rounding conservatively downward due to partial invisibility and small quantity, I estimate the pumpkin seed weight to be approximately 9 grams."

The image shows an open sandwich with two slices of bread, one spread with mayonnaise and the other with cheese and two small cornichons. The target food item to estimate is mayonnaise. The mayonnaise layer is spread evenly but thinly across one slice of bread. The slice itself is roughly the size of a hand, approximately 12 cm by 7 cm in visible surface area. The mayonnaise layer has an estimated thickness of about 2-3 mm, judging by the visible texture and spread pattern. Mayonnaise is fairly dense but spread thinly here. Calculating volume roughly as 12 cm x 7 cm x 0.25 cm = 21 cubic cm. Mayonnaise has a density close to 1 g/cm3, so this corresponds to about 21 grams. Given the thin and even layer, slight variations in thickness could adjust the weight by ±5g. Therefore, a conservative and visually grounded estimate for the mayonnaise weight is 20 grams."

The image shows a close-up of a person's palm holding a handful of cashew nuts (noix de cajou). I count 18 individual cashew nuts visible. Each cashew nut is approximately 2-3 cm in length and fairly thick, indicating moderate volume. Considering cashew nuts are dense and compact, the weight of one medium-sized cashew nut typically ranges between 1.2 and 1.5 grams. Multiplying by 18 nuts and using an average weight of about 1.4 grams per nut gives a weight close to 25 grams. There is no visible container weight involved, and the nuts appear whole and not broken. Therefore, based on visual count, size, density, and typical single nut weight, I estimate the total weight of these noix de cajou to be approximately 25 grams."

The image shows one small feuilleté (puff pastry) with tomato sauce visible on one side. The piece is singular and isolated on a wooden surface. It appears to be about 3-4 cm in width and about 2.5-3 cm in height, with a thickness of roughly 2-3 cm estimated by the puff pastry layers visible at the side. The puff pastry dough is flaky but dense, and the tomato sauce is distributed thinly inside or on the surface. Given its size compared to the wood grain texture and typical puff pastry density, this is a small-sized pastry snack, probably a petite canapé-like portion. Puff pastries are somewhat dense due to layers of butter and dough, but this one is quite small. Taking these visual clues into account and applying a moderate density for puff pastry with tomato sauce, a single piece like this likely weighs about 15-20 grams. To be conservative and avoid overestimation, I estimate the weight to be 17 grams."

The green pieces are relatively small, with roughly 10-12 small diced bits visible. Each piece is thin and light. Compared to the slice of bread beneath, which is about the size of a standard slice (around 10 cm length), the oignon pieces occupy only a small surface area and are lightweight. Considering the typical density and lightness of fresh onions and the small volume observed, the total weight is expected to be very low. Estimating each small piece to be about 0.3-0.5 grams, the total weight for all visible oignon pieces would be approximately 3.5 to 6 grams. Being conservative and prioritizing the visible evidence, I estimate the weight of the oignon to be about 5 grams."

The target food item is 'sauce oignons' visible as a reddish-brown onion sauce spread mostly around and slightly under the roasted meat. The sauce appears to cover the base of the meat and slightly spread towards the salads, but the quantity is relatively thin and unevenly distributed. Based on visual comparison, the amount of sauce visible looks like a thin layer covering an area approximately the size of the meat slices, maybe about 8 cm by 7 cm, with a thickness estimated to be around 3-4 mm. Considering the density of an onion-based sauce which is mostly liquid with softened onion pieces, the density is close to water but slightly increased due to onions. The overall volume looks to be roughly 20-25 ml. Taking density around 1.1 g/ml as a reasonable estimate, the weight of the sauce oignons is thus approximately 22-28 grams. To be conservative and grounded strictly in visual evidence, I estimate the sauce oignons weight to be 25 grams."

The croissant is roughly the length from the base of the person's fingers to about mid-palm, suggesting a length of around 10-12 cm. It is a typical triangular shape with a visible chocolate filling at the bottom edge, indicating it is a filled pastry. The top is sprinkled with small nuts or similar toppings, adding some weight but not significant bulk. The croissant looks moderately thick, approximately 3-4 cm in height, with a flaky, layered texture. Considering typical densities for such pastries and the visible thickness, along with the size relative to the hand, the croissant appears to be a medium-sized single serving. Given these clues, an estimated weight for this croissant au chocolat is around 85 grams, allowing for some variability in density and filling volume."

The egg half is about 4-5 cm in length and 2-3 cm wide, with an approximate thickness visible from the side. Given this is a half of an egg, the full egg would be roughly double this size, but since we only see half, we focus on this portion. A whole medium-sized hard-boiled egg typically weighs around 50 grams, with half weighing approximately 25 grams. Taking into account that part of the egg white and yolk is visible and intact and that the portion is a clean half, no significant loss or additions. Therefore, the estimated weight for the visible half egg in the image is around 25 grams."

The target food is 'avocat' (avocado). In the image, the avocado is present as two relatively thick slices placed near the top center of a galette wrap. Each slice appears to be about 6-7 cm long and 2-3 cm wide, with a thickness around 1-1.5 cm, judging by their raised profile above the wrap and comparison with the shredded carrots nearby and the slice of ham below. The avocado slices cover a moderate area but are not overlapping or piled. Avocado has a medium density (creamy, more dense than lettuce but less than solid meat). Given that an average avocado weighs about 150-200 grams whole, a typical slice of this thickness and size would weigh roughly 30-40 grams. Here, as there are effectively two slices representing less than half an avocado, it's reasonable to estimate around 35 grams total. This aligns with the visual volume and thickness seen on the plate while accounting for the density of avocado flesh."

Visually, the chia seeds appear as small dark specks dispersed throughout the mixture and are not clumped or piled separately. The total volume of the mixture fills roughly half to two-thirds of a medium-sized bowl. Since graines de chia are tiny seeds, their actual weight relative to the total volume is quite low. Considering that chia seeds absorb liquid and swell but still constitute a small proportion by weight in such mixtures, I estimate that the visible amount of graines de chia dispersed throughout corresponds to around 10-15 grams. This estimate avoids overestimating by acknowledging that the seeds are embedded and not densely packed or heaped. Therefore, a careful, conservative estimate is 12 grams for the graines de chia in this bowl."

The image shows a single piece of pain aux fruits being held between the thumb and forefinger, indicating it is relatively small. The piece has a rough, dense crust with visible chunks of nuts and sugar crystals on the surface. The edges appear thick and firm, suggesting a compact and dense baked good. The visible area is roughly the size of two fingertips wide, estimating about 6 cm by 5 cm in surface area. The thickness cannot be measured precisely but looks to be about 2.5 cm, based on the edge appearances and typical bread crust size. Given the density of the bread and inclusions of fruit and nuts, it is denser than standard bread but less dense than pure pastry. Typical fruit bread with similar dimensions weighs approximately 90-110 grams. Considering this piece is slightly irregular but compact, I estimate the weight at a conservative 95 grams to avoid overestimation."

The image shows one whole cooked artichaut placed on a round white plate. The artichaut appears to be intact and whole, with visible large leaves closed tightly around the core. Comparing it to the visible hand holding the plate, the artichaut is about the size of an average adult palm, roughly 10-12 cm in length and about 7-8 cm wide. The depth/thickness is moderate, roughly 6-7 cm, judging by the visible layering of leaves. Cooked artichokes are dense but contain some air space between leaves, so weight is less than fully dense foods of similar size. The sauce on the plate should not be included in the weight. Based on these observations, and considering typical density of cooked artichoke (about 0.6-0.7 g/cm³), I estimate the weight of the whole artichaut to be approximately 140 grams."

The cottage cheese occupies a tight cluster that covers roughly a 3-4 cm diameter area, with a low height/depth of approximately 1 cm, judging by the slight shadow and texture. It sits as a compact dollop rather than dispersed or spread out. Comparing its size to nearby items—such as the olives and egg—the cottage cheese portion is noticeably smaller and compressed, reflecting a typical serving. Given cottage cheese's known density and moisture content, and this visual volume, I estimate the weight to be approximately 40 grams. This aligns with a modest but visible portion on the plate, ensuring no overestimation by taking into account the small container-like shape and thickness visible."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The image shows a clear glass bottle roughly half-filled with shelled peanuts ('cacahuètes'). The peanuts appear to be whole or large pieces, not crushed or fragmented. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The bottle size can be roughly estimated by comparing it to the countertop and other kitchen objects partially visible in the background, suggesting the bottle is about the size of a standard small glass container (around 10-12 cm height with a narrow neck). The peanuts fill about 40-50% of the bottle volume from the bottom to just below the neck, roughly a small handful. Step 3: Density Considerations - Peanuts are dense nuts, around 0.6-0.7 g/cm³ typically. The volume filled by the peanuts inside the bottle likely corresponds to approximately 50-60 ml when accounting for air gaps between pieces. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Using the volume estimate and density, 50-60 ml x ~0.65 g/cm³ = roughly 32-39 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - The portion is visibly small, less than half the bottle and the bottle itself is not very large, confirming the estimate is consistent with visual clues. Step 6: Final Error-Prevention Check - The estimate is under 200 grams as expected for this small amount, considers density, and applies no overestimation for small or thin items. Therefore, I conservatively estimate the peanuts weight in the bottle at about 35 grams."

The pieces vary in size but overall it appears like scrambled contents equivalent to about half a standard large egg. There is no visible shell or extra parts, only cooked scrambled egg. Comparing the size of the scrambled egg pile to the avocado and tomato portions on the plate and the 20 cm width tortilla (wrap) partially on the plate provides good reference for scale. Considering the thin and somewhat loosely packed nature of scrambled eggs, I estimate the weight to be about 40 grams, which corresponds to roughly half of a medium to large egg after cooking. This avoids overestimating for density or volume and takes a conservative approach given the visual evidence."

The thickness of the egg white is uneven but generally thin, about 3-5 mm, with a slightly thicker yolk mound around 1.5-2 cm in height. The yolk appears to be slightly cooked but still somewhat runny, so density is standard for a cooked egg yolk. Considering the average weight of a large fried egg (without shell) is about 43-50 grams, and this one appears to be a standard size with no visible trimming or missing parts, I estimate the weight of the oeuf au plat to be around 48 grams."

Comparing the cookie to the granite pattern gives a sense of its size, which appears to be about 7-8 cm in diameter. Its thickness looks to be around 1.5 cm based on visible edge texture and shadowing. The cookie is dense with chocolate chunks, suggesting a moderate to high weight density. Common homemade cookies of this size generally weigh between 40 and 60 grams.

The mayonnaise appears creamy and dense, occupying a roughly circular area about 3-4 cm in diameter and approximately 1-1.5 cm thick. Comparing its size to the asparagus spears (each about 1.5-2 cm in diameter and 10-12 cm long), the mayonnaise portion is modest but not a large spoonful. Mayonnaise is dense and thick, so even a small volume translates to a significant weight. Given this visual evidence, the mayonnaise portion likely weighs around 20-25 grams.

The thickness of the spread layer looks thin to moderate, likely around 2-3 mm thick. Given the dense and sticky texture of chestnut cream, it has a relatively high density compared to a simple jam or sauce. Visually, the chestnut cream layer seems to weigh less than the bread underneath. Estimating the spread area to be about 30-40 square cm and with a thin layer, the weight of the crème de marrons is likely between 10 and 20 grams. Considering cautious estimation to avoid overestimation of thin layers and the visible portion, the best estimate is about 15 grams for the crème de marrons spread shown."

The target food item is 'yogourt nature' seen spread on a single slice of pain complet (whole grain bread) on a plate. The yogourt is a white spread layer underneath a layer of orange marmalade (confiture mirabelle). Visually, the yogourt layer appears relatively thin but covers most of the bread slice surface, without overflowing the edges. The bread slice is approximately 12 cm long and 7-8 cm wide, a typical size for a single slice of whole grain bread. The thickness of the yogourt spread looks uniform and resembles roughly 3-4 mm depth based on the visible side and small elevations created by the confiture. Yogourt has a density close to water, about 1 g/cm3. Estimating volume: 12 cm × 8 cm × 0.3-0.4 cm = approx 28-38 cm3. Given density ~1 g/cm3, weight will be approximately 28-38 grams. Considering some spread thinner areas and natural unevenness, a reasonable estimate is about 33 grams for the yogourt spread. Therefore, the weight of 'yogourt nature' on the plate is approximately 33 grams."
p96w4a,salade verte avec sauce,19.0,20,1.0,0.0020388453696748576,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/84905336-4de3-4568-8ab7-ad7669f93f6b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small amount of green salad leaves scattered loosely on a large white plate. There are approximately 7 medium-sized pieces of lettuce visible. Each lettuce leaf appears thin and light, with some visible dressing or sauce on the leaves, which adds minimal weight. The salad is flat, with little volume or layering, suggesting minimal depth. The plate's size relative to the leaves suggests these pieces occupy a very small surface area. Given the fragility and volume of lettuce, and considering the dressing adds negligible extra weight, each piece likely weighs about 2 to 3 grams. Multiplying by the number of pieces and adjusting for variability, the total weight is estimated conservatively at around 20 grams. This fits well with visual evidence and avoids overestimation typical of light leafy greens."

In the image, there is one single tartine (slice of bread) placed on a large white plate. The tartine is irregularly shaped, approximately half the width of the plate, which is a standard-sized dinner plate (about 26-28 cm diameter). The slice appears toasted or slightly browned. It is spread with both beurre (butter) and crème de marrons (chestnut cream). Visually, the tartine has a moderate thickness consistent with a small to medium slice of bread, about 1.5 to 2 cm thick. The butter is visible in small patches, likely about 5 grams, while the chestnut cream spread covers most of the tartine uniformly, about 10-15 grams based on spread thickness and shine. The bread itself, given the size and density of a toasted slice, likely weighs around 25-30 grams. Summing these, the bread (28g) plus butter (~5g) plus chestnut cream (13g) yields an estimated total around 46 grams. Given that spreads and bread are light but dense enough to add up, this is a reasonable estimate purely based on visible size, coverage, and texture without overestimating. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'tartine avec crème de marrons et beurre' at about 46 grams."
wrah5h,pain,51.0,50,1.0,0.005472690202811461,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/c73a766e-70bf-435f-b53a-6b981cf634e3,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'pain'. In the image, there is one visible slice of brown bread (pain) on a small plate. The bread slice has a rough crust and an irregular shape typical of artisan or whole grain bread. The size of the slice is comparable to a teaspoon handle near the plate, indicating a medium-sized slice. The bread slice covers about one-third of the plate surface. The thickness of the slice appears moderate, around 1.5 cm. Given the density of whole grain bread, which is generally between 0.3 to 0.4 g/cm³, and assuming a slice roughly 12 cm in length, 8 cm in width, and 1.5 cm thick, the approximate volume is 144 cm³. Multiplying by density (~0.35 g/cm³), the weight estimate is roughly 50 grams. This matches visual evidence without overestimating size or assuming thickness beyond what is evident. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'pain' slice to be about 50 grams."

The target food item is ""vinaigre balsamique."" In the image, the vinaigre balsamique appears as a dark brown liquid drizzled over the salad's surface inside a small white bowl. The amount covers some of the visible salad ingredients (radish slices, tomato pieces, lettuce leaves), but it is a thin layer and not pooled heavily. Given the relative volume compared to the size of the bowl and visible salad components, the vinaigre balsamique likely corresponds to approximately one to two tablespoons. A tablespoon of liquid is approximately 15 grams, and considering the thin spread and partial coverage, the actual quantity looks closer to 10-15 grams. Additionally, balsamic vinegar is quite fluid, so no hidden volume can be assumed. Therefore, a conservative yet visually grounded estimate for the vinaigre balsamique is about 12 grams."
p8a2w5,mayonnaise,28.0,27,1.0,0.0030046142289945274,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/d767c564-a3e6-4306-b022-ea44636699d8,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food to estimate is mayonnaise. On the plate, there is a white creamy dollop on the left side. It appears smooth and thick, with a slight peak and swirl typical of mayonnaise served with a spoon or a squeeze bottle. Compared visually to the nearby items—a piece of tortilla, grilled eggplant slices, and salad russe—the mayonnaise portion occupies approximately a circular area about 4-5 cm in diameter and appears moderately heaped, with an estimated height of about 2 cm. The total volume is roughly in the range of 25-30 milliliters. Given that mayonnaise has a density close to 0.9 g/ml, the weight should be slightly less than the volume in grams but close. Therefore, estimating conservatively, this portion of mayonnaise weighs about 27 grams, reflecting its creamy but somewhat dense consistency. This makes sense given the visual size compared to the fork and other foods on the plate, and it is not an excessively large dollop. The weight is well below 200g, aligning with typical serving sizes of mayonnaise in a meal."

The target food item is the 'galette wraps', which is the flat, round wrap underneath all the visible toppings. Visually, the wrap has a diameter of approximately 20-22 cm, based on comparison to the visible fork and plate size. The wrap is thin and flexible, visible in its entirety and flat on the plate, with no side profile thickness beyond a few millimeters. It is unapplied with toppings spread over most of its surface but the weight should exclude the toppings or any sauce. Galette wraps are known to be thin but denser than a tortilla due to whole grain or buckwheat content, which matches the visible textured surface. Considering its diameter and thinness, a typical galette wrap of this size visually weighs around 55-70 grams. Due to the clear image and lack of visible thickness layering, leaning towards the lower end is appropriate. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the galette wrap to be 65 grams."
