The image shows a small piece of a croissant, which is labeled as 'demi croissant' in the input. A typical croissant weighs around 60-70 grams, so half of it would weigh approximately 30-35 grams. However, the piece visible in the image is not a full half but rather a smaller portion of a croissant. Based on its size and volume, I estimate it to be about one-third of a croissant. Therefore, the weight of this piece is likely around 20-25 grams. Considering the visible size and density of the croissant, I estimate the weight to be 22 grams."

The fresh spinach (épinards frais) is visible as the base layer of the salad, covering the bottom of the bowl. The leaves are whole and not chopped, and they appear to be loosely packed. Based on the size of the bowl and the visible volume of spinach, I estimate that there are approximately 50-70 grams of fresh spinach. Fresh spinach is lightweight and takes up significant volume, so I will estimate the weight at the lower end of this range to account for the loose packing."

The butter is spread thinly on both slices, covering most of the surface area but not in a thick layer. Based on the visual appearance, the total amount of butter on both slices is likely around 10 grams, as butter is dense and spreads thinly. This estimate accounts for the visible coverage and typical density of butter."

The butter is visible on both slices, but it is spread thinly. Based on the size of the bread slices and the thin application of butter, I estimate that there is approximately 5 grams of butter on each slice. Since there are two slices, the total weight of the butter is approximately 10 grams."

In the image, the chia seeds are mixed into a bowl of blanc battu (a type of yogurt or quark), along with other ingredients like oats and honey. Chia seeds are small and dense, and their distribution in the mixture appears moderate. Based on the visible amount of chia seeds relative to the overall volume of the dish, I estimate that approximately 10-15 grams of chia seeds were used. This is a typical amount for such a preparation, as chia seeds expand when mixed with liquid. Considering the visual density and spread, I estimate the weight of the chia seeds to be 12 grams."
