wrah5h,gaufre à la patate douce,85.0,400,315.0,2.853869111063739,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1876b0b6-568d-4583-8186-073df252e6c9,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is ""gaufre à la patate douce"" (sweet potato waffle). In the image, there are four pieces of waffles arranged on a plate, each topped with a layer of demi crème acidulée and slices of smoked salmon. The waffles appear thick and dense, typical of sweet potato content. Each piece is roughly the size of a typical waffle quarter, about 8-10 cm per side, and the thickness appears around 2 cm. Considering the density of sweet potato waffles compared to normal waffles, they are heavier. A standard plain Belgian waffle weighs around 70-90g per quarter. Sweet potato waffles tend to be slightly denser and heavier, so I estimate approximately 90-120g per quarter piece. Since the image shows four pieces (one whole waffle), the total waffle weight would be around 360-480g. Focusing on only the waffle portion (not including the toppings), and given visual fullness and thickness, a reasonable estimate is about 400 grams total for the whole waffle. This estimate is within expected ranges and is plausible based on size and density."
p96w4a,délice tomate mozzarella,54.0,280,226.0,1.3007887444041781,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/5ebafbd6-315d-44a6-8508-ba143d23adb2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with a 'délice tomate mozzarella,' which is composed of alternating slices of fresh tomato and mozzarella cheese, topped with herbs and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar. There are about 7 slices of tomato and 6 slices of mozzarella, arranged in a layered fashion. Each tomato slice appears to be of medium thickness, and similarly for the mozzarella slices. Given that a typical medium tomato weighs around 120-150 grams and is usually cut into 6-8 slices, each slice likely weighs about 15-25 grams. Multiplying by the 7 visible slices gives roughly 105-175 grams for the tomato component. For the mozzarella, a typical fresh mozzarella ball weighs about 125-150 grams; given the slices visible, roughly the whole ball seems present, so I estimate about 130-150 grams of mozzarella. Since the dish is a layered combined item, the weight of the whole 'délice tomate mozzarella' is approximately the sum of tomato and mozzarella slices, about 240-320 grams. Choosing a value in the upper half range and accounting for density and added balsamic, I estimate the weight of the délice tomate mozzarella at 280 grams."
wrah5h,haricots rouges,91.0,300,209.0,2.0271797058196546,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1550c506-8c95-461f-b658-8f427dc2a0af,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with three distinct food items: haricots rouges (red kidney beans), cooked fusilli pasta, and a portion of white mozzarella. The target item, 'haricots rouges,' is located on the left side of the plate. The beans appear well-cooked and moist, likely with some light seasoning or garnish. Considering their volume relative to the plate size and comparing to the pasta portion nearby, the beans form a dense and compact portion roughly covering a small quarter of the plate. Given that cooked legumes weigh approximately 250-350g per serving with typical Swiss portions and legumes are known to be underestimated visually, I estimate the initial visual weight to be around 150-200g. Applying the critical adjustment for dense legume dishes (+40-60%), the weight increases significantly to about 230-320g. Since the visible portion of haricots rouges looks like a normal to generous serving, I place my estimate in the upper half of the adjusted range for precision and plausibility. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the haricots rouges to be approximately 300 grams."
wrah5h,betterave,65.0,260,195.0,1.350991259859305,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/bba5cf64-1d08-40cb-bc6c-bfdd2a7c2116,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with several distinct portions including diced beetroot (betterave), quinoa, mango, cucumber, tomato, and avocado. The betterave portion is diced into relatively uniform cubes and occupies a noticeable section of the plate, about a quarter of the plate surface. Beetroot is a dense, moist vegetable with a higher density than leafy greens. A typical raw or cooked beetroot cube weighs around 10-15g depending on size. There appear to be roughly 15-18 cubes in total. At an average of about 12g per cube, the total estimated weight is around 180-210g. Considering Swiss portion ranges for cooked vegetables (150-300g) and applying the critical adjustment for dense vegetables (+40-60%), the estimate should be increased to approximately 250-270g to account for any underestimation. This aligns with the visible volume, density, and typical portion sizes for a serving of beetroot as seen in the image."
2ahgvr,porridge salé,48.0,240,192.0,0.9823065444468131,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a35f3211-3b33-4826-97b8-3af69655dada,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small glass jar with a golden lid, filled about three-quarters with a creamy, thick porridge-like mixture, identified as 'porridge salé' (savory porridge). The jar's diameter is around 7 cm (indicated by the lid), and the height of the filled portion inside the jar is about 5-6 cm. Given the visible volume and the dense, moist texture typical of porridge, the density is relatively high, close to 1g/ml. Estimating the volume at roughly 200-250 ml, this suggests a weight of around 200-250 grams. Considering possible air pockets or slight liquid content, and to avoid underestimation, I place the final weight in the upper half of that range. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'porridge salé' is approximately 240 grams."
6fwmw2,salade de céleri,49.0,230,181.0,0.9453208271157536,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/6fwmw2/dish_media/1a96e805-fc15-4295-90a7-73a41fcb683f,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The salade de céleri is located at the bottom right corner of the plate, appearing as a mound of finely grated or shredded celery root mixed with a creamy dressing. Its portion size is roughly comparable in volume to the salade de carotte (top right), but the texture and density of grated celery root mixed with dressing makes it denser and heavier than it looks. Typical Swiss portion sizes for dense salads range from 200 to 400 grams, but given this is a smaller plated portion, it seems to be on the lower half of that range. The portion covers a modest area on the plate and is piled to give noticeable volume. Considering the likely density and moist dressing content, along with the size relative to the other salads on the plate and the chicken portion, an initial visual estimate might be around 130-170 grams. Given the consistent underestimation of dense salads, I will adjust upward by about 50%, resulting in an estimate around 195 to 255 grams. Choosing a value in the upper half of this reasonable range, I estimate the weight of the salade de céleri to be approximately 230 grams."
xjvrtk,tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe,250.0,120,130.0,3.4640801534853978,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/f607625b-a07d-423e-a564-4d96ebadf084,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single slice of a tarte flambée topped with cooked rhubarb and apple pieces. The slice is on a medium-sized plate, which helps give scale. The crust is thin, and the toppings are spread relatively evenly over the surface, with diced rhubarb and apple pieces visible. Tarte flambée is generally a thin dish but can still be relatively dense due to the cream base and fruit. A full tarte flambée typically weighs around 400-500g depending on toppings. This slice appears to be roughly one sixth of a full tarte. Initially, a basic proportional estimate would place it around 65-85g. However, because the rhubarb and apple topping are moist and dense, and such fruit-based toppings are often underestimated in weight, I will increase the estimate by approximately 50%. Considering this adjustment, a plausible weight range is about 100-130g. Given the visual fullness and density, I estimate the slice weighs approximately 120 grams."
p96w4a,chili,191.0,320,129.0,2.626199104668514,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/58f82c5a-4b79-4f95-9f8f-0b55a93d8383,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate divided into three parts: cooked rotini pasta on the left, a serving of chili containing chunks of cervelas sausage and beans on the right, and a dollop of crème fraîche in the middle. The chili covers about half the plate and contains visible meat chunks and kidney beans in a thick tomato-based sauce. Given its dense and moist consistency, chili is a dense legume and meat dish. Typically, a Swiss portion of legume-based dishes like chili ranges from 250 to 350 grams. Considering the volume on the plate—covering half the plate with substantial thickness—and density of the ingredients, the chili portion likely weighs near the higher end of this range. Therefore, I estimate the chili portion to weigh approximately 320 grams, accounting for the higher density and moistness of the dish."
8japfq,ratatouille,196.0,300,104.0,2.1726710722660414,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/b6659a8f-25e7-44f7-a351-7873f60f1586,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'ratatouille,' visible on the plate as a cooked vegetable mix with recognizable chunks of eggplant, zucchini, tomatoes, and possibly peppers. It occupies a moderate portion size on the plate, roughly a quarter of the plate's surface. The ratatouille is cooked and appears moist and dense, which affects its weight significantly compared to its visual volume. Considering the Swiss portion size for cooked vegetables ranges from about 150-300g, with a critical upward adjustment of 40-60% for dense vegetable dishes like ratatouille, I first estimate around 170-210g based on portion size and visual fullness, then increase this estimate 50% to compensate for underestimation of density and moisture. This yields an estimated weight range of approximately 255-315g. Choosing a value in the upper half of this adjusted range, I estimate the ratatouille at about 300 grams. This estimate is plausible given the visible portion size, the density of the dish, and the plate context alongside other foods."
wrah5h,tomates,48.0,150,102.0,0.5218503517373694,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/ee6e8045-59f2-4294-ae6a-1d5695abc176,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small portion of chopped tomatoes mixed with pieces of cucumber on a medium-sized decorative plate. The tomatoes are cut into several chunks, roughly 8-10 pieces, each about 2-3 cm in size. Tomatoes have a medium density and high water content, and this appears to be a modest salad portion. Considering the volume and the typical weight of tomato pieces of this size, each piece might weigh around 15 grams. Fully counting the pieces and adjusting for some pieces slightly hidden or smaller, the total weight of tomatoes on the plate likely ranges between 120 and 160 grams. Given the apparent portion size and the typical Swiss portion ranges for vegetables like tomatoes, I will select an estimate in the upper half of that range. Thus, I estimate the weight of the tomatoes in this image to be approximately 150 grams."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,320,97.0,4.311340865487103,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate filled with a tomato salad ('salade de tomates'). The tomatoes are sliced into wedges and slices, occupying almost the entire shallow plate. Considering the size of the plate relative to the nearby utensils, it appears to be a standard dinner plate around 25-27 cm in diameter. The tomato slices are fresh and relatively thick, and the plate is generously covered. There are visible balsamic vinegar and flax seeds sprinkled on top, but these contribute negligibly to the weight compared to the tomatoes. Typically, a medium-sized tomato weighs about 150-170g, and here I estimate about 2 medium tomatoes worth of slices on the plate. This gives an initial estimate around 300-340g. Tomatoes have a density close to water, so the visual volume fairly matches the mass. Considering this salad is just fresh tomatoes with dressing and seeds, there is no major underestimation factor. Based on the visual quantity and density, I estimate the weight of the tomato salad to be approximately 320 grams, which is consistent with typical Swiss fruit/vegetable portion sizes."
wrah5h,tomate,46.0,140,94.0,0.46088254103602644,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/712f4686-2c54-47d3-a8f2-811e15f6e76b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'tomate'. In the image, the tomatoes appear as several slices or chunks located on the left side of the container, next to the avocado and tofu. The tomatoes are fresh, uncooked slices that occupy around 1/6th to 1/5th of the container's surface area, with moderate thickness. Considering the size of the container (which seems to be a standard lunchbox roughly 18cm wide) and the visible tomato slices, I estimate the tomato portion to be equivalent to about 1 medium tomato. A medium tomato typically weighs around 120-150g. The slices are not spread thin but are moderately thick. Compared to the other ingredients, the tomato portion is significant but not dominant. Swiss portion reference size for vegetables like tomatoes is around 150-300g per serving as fresh vegetables or raw salad components, but tomato slices in a mixed dish often weigh closer to 100-150g. Given this, and factoring in moderate density and moisture of tomatoes, I estimate the tomato weight to be about 140 grams."
wrah5h,porc,52.0,140,88.0,0.48774248561074396,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/f727ac79-973e-4b92-8f2b-cda94222d4a7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a metal container with three clear sections: grilled aubergine slices on the top-left, a piece of pork with a white creamy mustard sauce on the bottom-left, and a portion of polenta topped with grated cheese on the right. Focusing on the pork, it appears as a single moderately sized slice about 8-10 cm long and 5-6 cm wide, and roughly 1-1.5 cm thick. Considering typical Swiss meat portions weigh 120-180g, and judging by the visible thickness and spread of the pork slice under the sauce, it looks like a medium portion but not excessively thick or large. The white sauce on top slightly obscures the meat, but the pork's edges and size are visible enough to estimate. The meat has moderate thickness and size, consistent with around 130-150g of pork. Since the meat looks lean and solid, this volume corresponds well to around 140g. This is within the standard portion range and fits the container size relative to the other portions. Therefore, I estimate the pork weight to be approximately 140 grams."
wrah5h,tiramisu,72.0,160,88.0,0.675335749307184,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/7b0475df-5b02-4072-abb9-ef75acf0f031,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with two dessert slices, one identified as tiramisu and the other as forêt noire. The tiramisu slice appears moist and fairly thick, approximately 10 cm long, 4-5 cm wide, and about 4-5 cm high. Tiramisu is a dense dessert with layers of soaked sponge and creamy mascarpone which add to the weight. A typical Swiss portion for such a slice would range from about 120 to 180 grams. Given the visual size and density of the slice, and considering slight moisture and cream volume, I estimate the tiramisu slice to be around 160 grams. This is within the typical portion sizes and aligns with the visible volume and dense texture of the dessert on the plate."
p8a2w5,artichaut,143.0,220,77.0,1.1736303560008527,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/9b2c7383-a434-4260-ac30-86103e4546ea,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single whole cooked artichaut (artichoke) placed on a white plate. The artichoke is medium-sized, roughly comparable to the size of a hand, which can be inferred from the thumb visible holding the plate. A typical medium artichoke, raw or cooked, usually weighs around 150-250 grams, including the fibrous outer leaves. Considering that the artichoke is whole and appears cooked (hence possibly slightly denser due to moisture retention), I estimate it weighs toward the upper half of this range. There is no additional food bulk or garnish that could add weight, so the focus is solely on this single artichoke. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the weight of this cooked artichoke is approximately 220 grams."
2ahgvr,brochette de boeuf,76.0,150,74.0,0.5994457471754423,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/5b8a0853-ecc4-4015-bc9a-2b50766f873a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The brochette de boeuf is visible on the plate as a skewer with three sizable chunks of beef. Each chunk appears to be roughly 3-4 cm thick and about 4-5 cm in length. Given that beef is dense and cooked pieces lose some moisture but retain most weight, a single chunk can be estimated around 50 grams. Three chunks together would thus approximately weigh 150 grams. Comparing to the size of the bread piece on the plate and the penne pasta salad, the meat portion looks consistent with a standard cooked beef skewer serving. Swiss standard meat portion size is around 120-180g, so 150g fits well. There is no sign of under- or overestimation here. Therefore, the estimated weight for the brochette de boeuf is 150 grams."

The image shows pieces of pineapple ('ananas') cut into triangular chunks and arranged on a medium-sized blue plate. The pieces appear fresh and juicy, with a typical density for pineapple. There are about 12 medium-sized chunks of pineapple visible, each roughly corresponding to about 20-25 grams based on volume and typical pineapple density. Multiplying the number of pieces by the average piece weight gives an initial estimate of about 240-300 grams. Pineapple is a fruit with moderate density, and typical Swiss fruit portion sizes for an item like pineapple range between 150-300 grams. Since these pieces are fairly substantial and cover a good portion of the plate, I select a weight in the upper half of the range, estimating the total to be approximately 270 grams. This accounts for the total visible volume and typical fruit serving size, and also accounts for any slight underestimation due to juiciness and thickness of the chunks."

The image shows a slice of tarte aux fraises on a standard dessert plate. The slice has a visible flaky crust base, a creamy custard or cream layer, with numerous fresh strawberries cut in halves and a few small red currants on top. The size of the slice is about a typical dessert portion, roughly one sixth to one eighth of a whole tart. The crust pieces and cream indicate a medium thickness, and the strawberries appear fresh and fairly large. Considering an average whole tarte aux fraises typically weighs around 600-700 grams including crust, cream, and fruit topping, the slice here would be around 1/6th to 1/8th of that. That suggests a weight range approximately between 75 grams (1/8 of 600g) to 115 grams (1/6 of 700g). Given some cream and fruit density, a slightly higher estimate within this range is reasonable. I estimate the weight of this tarte aux fraises slice to be approximately 100 grams."

The image shows a slice of homemade chocolate fondant cake on a plate. The slice is moderately thick, with visible dense and moist texture characteristic of a chocolate fondant, which is rich and denser than a typical sponge cake. The length of the slice appears to be around 12-14 cm, the width around 6-7 cm at the widest point, and thickness about 2.5-3 cm. Given the density and typical composition (chocolate, butter, eggs, sugar, flour), chocolate fondants tend to weigh more than what they appear by volume. A slice of this size would commonly weigh around 100-140g in Swiss portions. Considering the visible density and thickness, I estimate the weight to be near the upper half of that range, about 130 grams."

The image shows three vegetarian gyozas placed on a white plate. Each gyoza appears typical in size, roughly the length of a standard dumpling, about 7-8 cm long, with thin dough and a stuffed filling. Based on common culinary knowledge, a single gyoza typically weighs between 35-50 grams, depending on the filling and dough thickness. Given these are vegetarian, the filling might be slightly lighter or similar in density compared to meat versions, but not substantially lower. Observing the plate and the size relative to the plate, the portion seems to be an average serving of three gyozas. An initial estimate would suggest roughly 40 grams per piece, leading to a total of about 120 grams for all three. Since the portion is visually standard with no signs of being underfilled or overly dense, and given Swiss typical portion calibration for small, stuffed dumplings, I estimate the weight of these 3 vegetarian gyozas to be about 120 grams in total."

The image shows a plate with a serving of pâtes carbonara, identifiable by the creamy sauce, pasta shapes, and small pieces of bacon or pancetta mixed in. The portion covers a moderate area of the plate and appears to be of a typical single-serving size. Considering the visible volume and the creamy nature of the dish which adds some weight, the pasta quantity looks consistent with a typical Swiss serving size for cooked pasta, around 150-200g. The cheese (gruyère) sprinkled on top appears to be roughly one to two tablespoons, which would weigh around 15-25g, but since the target food is specifically the pâtes carbonara (the main pasta dish including sauce and meat), the cheese topping should be excluded from this estimate. Based on the volume and typical density of such creamy pasta dishes, I estimate the weight of the pâtes carbonara (pasta with sauce and meat) portion to be approximately 180 grams."

The mozzarella appears as a single, whole ball of soft cheese on the plate. Visually, the mozzarella ball occupies a moderate portion of the plate and has a smooth, slightly glossy texture indicating it is fresh and moist. A typical standard mozzarella ball of this size usually weighs between 100 to 150 grams. Given the visible size compared to the olives and salad leaves, this mozzarella is on the smaller to medium side, so an estimate near the middle of that range is appropriate. Italy-style fresh mozzarella balls commonly weigh about 125 grams. Considering there's no apparent cutting or missing piece, I'll estimate the mozzarella weight as 125 grams."

The image shows a single clear glass bottle labeled 'GINGER' which is a tonic water or ginger beer type beverage. The bottle appears to be a standard small glass soda bottle typically used in Switzerland and Europe. These bottles usually range between 200 ml to 300 ml in volume. Considering the fullness of the bottle, it appears to be almost full, and tonic or soda water density is close to that of water, about 1 g/ml. Therefore, the weight in grams is roughly equivalent to the volume in milliliters. Given the standard bottle size and visual size relative to the glass and other items on the table, I estimate this bottle to hold about 250 ml of tonic water. This corresponds to approximately 250 grams in weight for the liquid content. The weight estimate is for the liquid only, excluding the bottle's glass weight."

The hummus appears compact and dense, filling about half of a small glass container typically around 150 ml in volume. Considering the density of hummus is close to 1 g/ml, the volume suggests roughly 70-90 grams of hummus. Given the visible portion size, I estimate around 80 grams of basil hummus. This is consistent with a typical small serving portion of hummus and fits the visible portion in the glass. As this is a dense, purchased hummus, there is no need for large upward adjustment beyond volume estimation."

The image shows a bowl containing sliced kiwi pieces and séré maigre (a type of low-fat quark or fresh cheese). The kiwi pieces cover about half of the bowl's surface and consist of many medium-sized slices. A whole kiwi fruit typically weighs about 75-90g depending on size, and it appears that roughly one whole kiwi has been peeled and sliced here. Given that the kiwi flesh is dense and moist, the weight is close to the actual fruit weight minus the skin. Therefore, estimating about 75 grams of kiwi in the bowl seems reasonable. No visible honey (miel) is prominent, so we exclude that from this estimate as per the instruction to estimate only the specified food item."

The image shows a plate of penne pasta topped with vegetable meatballs in tomato sauce and grated gruyère cheese. The vegetable meatballs appear to be medium-sized, with about 9 visible on the plate. Each meatball looks dense and moist, covered in tomato sauce, which adds weight. Typically, vegetable meatballs of this size weigh around 25-30 grams each. Multiplying by 9 gives an initial estimate between 225 and 270 grams. Considering the density of the meatballs and sauce, and that such dishes are often underestimated, adding a 40-60% upward adjustment is appropriate. This adjustment leads to a range of roughly 315 to 430 grams. Selecting a value in the upper half to avoid underestimation, I estimate the weight of the ""boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate"" to be approximately 360 grams."

The image shows a purple bowl with three main visible components: the large flat green beans (haricots cocos), cooked pearl wheat grains (perle de blé) in a yellow saffron cream sauce, and several shrimp (crevettes). The pearl wheat is cooked and mixed with sauce, making it more dense and moist. The quantity of pearl wheat occupies roughly half of the bowl's volume, with a typical bowl size for a single serving approximately 500-600 ml. Pearl wheat is dense and compact, similar to couscous or small pasta grains, and the sauce adds moisture and weight. Given the volume it occupies in the bowl and texture, an initial estimate might be around 120-160g. Considering the Swiss reference for pasta-like cooked grains is 130-220g and the visible portion fills around half the bowl, plus accounting for moisture and sauce density, I should lean toward the upper half of the range. The visible portion is dense and moist, so my estimate is around 180 grams for the pearl wheat portion."

The image shows a white bowl containing apricot-flavored industrial yogurt with visible fruit pieces. The yogurt fills about one third of a medium-sized bowl, with a smooth creamy texture and some small chunks of apricot. Commercial apricot yogurts typically come in standard single-serving containers of around 125 to 150 grams. Considering that the bowl doesn't look completely full and given the modest volume visible, I estimate the yogurt portion to be slightly less than a full standard serving but close to typical yogurt container sizes. Taking into account the fruit pieces, the density is similar to regular yogurt, so the weight should correspond closely to volume. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'yogourt industriel à l'abricot avec morceaux' to be approximately 130 grams."

The image shows a plate divided into three distinct parts: cooked pasta (pâtes), a chili with visible chunks of cervelas sausage and kidney beans, and a dollop of crème fraîche. The cervelas pieces in the chili are cut into medium-sized cubes and distributed throughout the chili portion, which itself occupies about half of the plate. Given the visible size of the cervelas pieces relative to the beans and sauce, and considering that cooked sausage is dense, I estimate each piece weighs around 15-20 grams. The visible pieces number approximately 8-10. Summing these with some margin for potentially hidden or embedded pieces, I estimate the total cervelas weight is around 160-180 grams. This fits well within the typical Swiss portion size for meat (120-180g). Considering the sausage density and volume within the chili, I choose an estimate of 170 grams for the cervelas portion."

The image shows a rectangular glass container filled with a couscous salad containing visible chunks of tuna (thon), pieces of cucumber, and some pumpkin seeds. The tuna pieces are scattered throughout the dish and appear as shredded or small chunks mixed evenly within the couscous. Considering the container is moderately full and of typical medium size (about 750-1000 ml volume), and the visible tuna amount is moderate but not dominant, I estimate the tuna to be roughly one-third or less of the dish by weight. Typical cooked tuna chunks in salads of this size would weigh around 120-150 grams to achieve this visible distribution. Swiss standard meat/fish serving sizes range from 120-180g, so this fits well within typical portion sizes. Given the density and spread of the tuna pieces amidst the couscous and cucumbers, I estimate the tuna weight to be approximately 140 grams."

The image shows a metal container with three distinct food portions: grilled aubergine slices, a pork cut covered with white sauce, and a serving of polenta topped with grated cheese. Focusing on the polenta, it occupies roughly one third of the container's area, appearing as a dense, moist mound beneath a generous amount of shredded cheese. Polenta is a cooked starchy dish that tends to be dense but somewhat airy, with typical Swiss cooked starch portions around 130-220g. Considering the container size relative to the other items, the polenta portion is substantial and compact. The cheese on top adds some weight, but the task is to estimate only the polenta itself. Assuming the cheese portion is about 30-40g, the visible polenta portion likely weighs in the range of 140-180g. Given the portion's density and volume in the container, and erring on the higher end as recommended for cooked dense dishes, I estimate the polenta weight to be approximately 170 grams."

The image shows a single rectangular waffle ('gaufre') on a decorative plate. The waffle appears to be of a standard size, similar to commercially made or homemade rectangular waffles, roughly 10x15 cm in dimension. Waffles are generally light and airy but still have some density due to the batter. A typical waffle of this size generally weighs between 70 and 100 grams. Given it looks fully cooked and not overly thick, I would estimate the weight towards the middle-upper range. There is apple compote on top, but since the requested item is only the waffle, that weight is excluded. Considering typical waffle density and portion size, a reasonable estimate for the waffle alone is about 85 grams."

The image shows a single scoop of vanilla ice cream ('boule de glace vanille') covered partly with hot chocolate sauce in a small white bowl. The scoop is about the size of a standard ice cream scoop, which typically weighs around 80-100 grams. Considering the visible volume and typical density of vanilla ice cream, the weight is likely close to 90 grams. The hot chocolate sauce adds volume but is not part of the requested estimate. Given the size and typical portion norms in Switzerland for one scoop, 90 grams is a reasonable and plausible estimate."

The target food item is ""fromage de brebis/chèvre (2 bouts)"" which corresponds to the two small pieces of cheese on the left side of the plate near the bottom left corner. They are small wedge-shaped portions of cheese with a rind, typical of sheep or goat cheese. In comparison to the other cheeses on the plate, these two pieces together have a modest volume. Given their size, the cheese pieces are likely each around 20-30 grams, so combined around 40-60 grams. Typically, small cheese portions like these that are cut wedges weigh on this order. There is no visible missing part or extreme thickness that would suggest a substantially larger weight. Considering the density of cheese and visual size, I estimate the total weight of the two bouts of fromage de brebis/chèvre to be about 50 grams, which is within the plausible range and consistent with the relative size to other cheeses on the plate."

The image shows a white bowl with cereals partially covered in milk. The cereal pieces are small flakes and clusters, typical of granola or mixed cereals, with a few visible chocolate chunks. The amount of cereal covers the bottom of the bowl but does not fill it more than about one-third in volume. The bowl itself seems a common medium size, roughly 15 cm in diameter. Given the visual volume and the fact that cereals are relatively dense but less so than cooked dense foods, the portion looks like a modest single serving. Swiss standard cereal portions tend to be around 30-50 grams. Considering the visible amount and the milk diluting the visual bulk slightly, the estimate should be closer to the upper half of this range. Thus, I estimate the weight of the dry cereals in this bowl to be approximately 45 grams."

The target food item is 'mais' (corn), which is located on the plate in a small pile near the center-bottom of the plate. Compared to the other items—lettuce leaves (salade), broccoli florets (brocolis), and chickpeas (pois chiches)—the corn portion looks moderate in quantity but not heaped. Corn kernels are dense but small, and a typical serving of cooked corn is about 150-200g. Visually, the portion of corn here looks roughly half of a common full serving. Considering the plate size and relative quantity, the corn portion likely weighs around 75-100 grams. Since the visibility is clear and the kernels appear uniformly distributed and not overly compacted, I estimate the weight to be about 90 grams, balancing between size and density cues."

The image shows a yellow bell pepper ('poivrons jaune'), with one half stuffed with cooked quinoa and bulgur with curry, and two roasted slices of pepper on the plate. The pepper is of medium size, likely around 10-12 cm in height. Cooked yellow bell peppers are dense but not very heavy since they contain a lot of water. A medium raw bell pepper typically weighs about 150-180g, but roasting slightly reduces water content. Considering the two slices plus the stuffed main part, the total yellow pepper here appears to be close to one medium-sized pepper minus the seeds. I estimate that the roasted yellow bell pepper portion visible here weighs approximately 110-130 grams. Given the visual thickness and the slight shrinkage due to roasting, I place my weight estimate at 120 grams, which is reasonable and aligns with typical cooked vegetable portion sizes. This is within the expected range for this kind of vegetable portion on a plate."

The image shows a medium-sized glass bottle partially filled with shelled peanuts (cacahuètes). The peanuts occupy roughly one-third to one-quarter of the bottle's volume. Peanuts are dense and have a typical density around 0.6-0.7g/ml due to their shelled and slightly irregular shape. Considering the size of the bottle — approximately the size of a small juice bottle, likely around 300ml capacity — and that peanuts fill about 100ml volume, the weight should be roughly 60-70 grams. Given some air gaps between peanuts and irregular shape, I estimate around 65 grams. This aligns with typical snack portion weights and makes sense compared to the bottle size and peanut volume."

The avocado ('avocat') is presented as two relatively thick slices placed near the top of a standard-sized galette wrap on a plate. A typical avocado half weighs approximately 150-170 grams including the skin and pit, but here only about one-third to half of an avocado is visible as peeled slices, which correlates to roughly 50-80 grams of usable avocado flesh. The slices are thick and fresh-looking, covering a moderate length on the wrap. Considering typical serving sizes and the visible portion size in relation to the other ingredients on the wrap, I would estimate the avocado weight to be about 65 grams. This fits common portion references for avocado slices in such servings and aligns with the plate size and ingredient proportions."

The image shows a glass container divided into two portions: on the left, cooked courgette and onions, and on the right, millet patties with black beans and corn. The target food is 'courgette et oignons.' The cooked courgettes and onions appear to fill about half of the container's volume, roughly a rectangular space about 10 cm by 8 cm in the container, and about 2-3 cm deep. These are cooked vegetables, so their density is quite high, close to 0.8-1.0 g/ml. Estimating the volume around 160-200 ml, the raw weight might be roughly similar due to moisture retained. Swiss portion reference for cooked vegetables is around 150-300g, but knowing these are dense cooked veggies in a substantial portion filling half the container, it is likely at the upper end. The visual volume and density suggest an initial estimate about 180-230g. Considering the adjustment for dense cooked vegetable dishes (increasing by about 40-60%) due to typical underestimation, I increase the weight estimate to approximately 275 grams. This fits well with visual cues, container size, and the proportion relative to the other food items visible in the container. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'courgette et oignons' to be about 275 grams."

The image shows a slice of 'délice des dieux', which consists of a biscuit base soaked with berry juice, topped with a creamy mixture of séré and mascarpone, and garnished with fresh red fruits: raspberries and blueberries. The slice is on a small dessert plate, allowing a scale reference. The biscuit base appears moist and dense, soaked with a dark red berry juice, while the creamy topping has a smooth, thick texture with visible thickness about 1.5-2 cm. The fruits placed on top are three raspberries and two blueberries, adding minor but noticeable weight. Typical Swiss dessert portion sizes for a slice like this usually range between 120-180g. Given the moist, dense composition and creamy topping, the density is relatively high. Considering the visible size, thickness, and density, and that desserts can sometimes be underestimated visually, I estimate the total weight to be toward the upper half of the range. Thus, I estimate approximately 180 grams for this portion."

The image shows a small yogurt container labeled 'yogourt figue sans sucre' which translates to sugar-free fig yogurt. The container is a standard single-serving size typically sold in Swiss stores, such as Migros Bio products. These yogurt portions generally weigh around 125 grams per cup. Given the container size, shape, and typical commercial packaging for this type of yogurt, it's reasonable to rely on this standard weight. There is no visible sign that some yogurt has been removed, so the container appears full. Therefore, based on known packaging and visual confirmation, the weight of the yogurt is approximately 125 grams."

The image shows a single small feuilleté with tomato sauce. Visually, it is roughly the size of a small pastry bite, approximately 4-5 cm in length, and looks fairly compact with layers of puff pastry and some tomato sauce filling inside. Puff pastry is light but the layering adds some density, and the tomato sauce adds moisture weight. Typical small feuilletés of this size weigh about 30-40 grams. Given the visible size and typical density, and considering Swiss portion contexts where small filled pastries often weigh around 30-50 grams, I estimate the weight to be closer to the upper part of this range to avoid underestimation. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this feuilleté sauce tomate to be approximately 45 grams."

The quantity of onion corresponds to a few tablespoons of chopped green onion or scallion greens, not dense nor heavy but contributing some weight. Given the visible size and amount, this portion is small but substantial enough to estimate. Typical chopped green onions weigh about 10-15g per tablespoon. Here, there appear to be roughly 2 tablespoons spread over the ham, suggesting an initial estimate around 20-30 grams. Given the light density of onions and the portion size, no upward dense food adjustment is needed. Comparing to other items, the onions are visibly much smaller in volume. I estimate the weight of the chopped onion pieces on this plate to be approximately 25 grams."

The sauce oignons (onion sauce) is visibly spread over and around the portion of roast meat, showing a reddish-brown liquid with cooked, translucent onion pieces. The sauce covers part of the plate surface and pools slightly beneath the meat and surrounding salads, indicating a moderate quantity. Typically, an onion sauce serving accompanying a roast in a Swiss meal is roughly between 30-60 grams. Given the visible amount, the partial coverage around the meat, and the moderate quantity of onions in the sauce, I estimate the weight closer to the upper half of this range because some of the sauce is pooled and soaked into the meat.

The image shows a bowl containing a mixture of rice and dahl de lentille (lentil stew). The rice is partially visible at the bottom and around the edges, and the majority of the visible food on top is the dahl, which appears thick and contains lentils and vegetables like carrots and onions. The bowl is medium-sized and filled about three-quarters full. Given that cooked rice typical Swiss portions range between 150-250g and legume dishes typically range from 250-350g but can be underestimated by 40-60%, I will focus on the dahl. Visually, the dahl occupies slightly more than half of the bowl's volume, is dense and moist. An initial rough estimate of the dahl based on volume would be around 140-180g. Considering the underestimation adjustment for legume dishes, the weight should be increased by approximately 50%. This results in a weight range of roughly 210-270g. Favoring the upper half for dense legume dishes, a final estimate for the dahl de lentille is about 260 grams. This is plausible given the bowl size, food density, and portion visible in the image."

The target food item is 'sauce'. Looking at the image, the sauce is a brown liquid covering a significant portion of the plate, surrounding and partially soaking the meat, mashed potatoes, and carrots. It spreads thinly but extends over a considerable plate area, likely from a moderate amount poured after plating. Given the thin layer but wide coverage, the sauce volume seems to be around 60-90 ml visually. Considering the density of typical meat sauce/gravy is close to water (about 1 g/ml), this translates roughly to 60-90 grams. Since this is a moist liquid, and visible distribution suggests a fairly generous serving but not excessive, an estimate in the upper half of this range around 80 grams is reasonable. The sauce does not look overly thick but is enough to saturate and flavor the dish well, so 80 grams is a plausible weight."

The bread slice looks standard sized, approximately 10cm by 7cm, and the yogurt layer's thickness looks about 0.5 cm on average. Yogurt density is close to water, roughly 1 g/ml, so the volume corresponds roughly to weight in grams. The yogurt spread on the slice probably amounts to around 50 ml or grams as an initial estimate. Given that yogurt on bread typically has a slightly varying thickness, and this spread looks a bit generous, I estimate it on the upper half of a plausible range from 40 to 60 grams. Therefore, a precise estimate for the yogurt nature is about 55 grams, consistent with observed volume and typical Swiss portion sizes for yogurt as a spread on bread."

The specified food item is 'yogourt orange sanguine' which is visible as the creamy, pinkish base mixed with the cereals and blueberries in the bowl. The bowl is medium-sized and filled primarily with the cereal and yogurt mixture, with the yogurt visibly coating the cereals and blueberries. Typically, a serving of flavored yogurt ranges between 120-180 grams. Given the visible quantity filling about 3/4 of the bowl and mixing closely with the cereal and blueberries, the yogurt portion itself will be slightly less than the entire mixture weight but substantial. Since the yogurt is mixed in and not just a thin layer, I estimate the yogurt weight as approximately 150 grams, which fits well within typical portion ranges for this type of food. The yogurt is less dense than cereals but the volume it takes up is significant, supporting this estimate. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'yogourt orange sanguine' is 150 grams."

The food item to estimate is the 'bout de gruyère' (piece of Gruyère cheese) visible on the plate. It is a long rectangular piece, about 12-14 cm long, and approximately 2-3 cm wide and about 1.5-2 cm thick. Gruyère is a dense hard cheese with a density roughly around 1.1 g/cm³. Given the dimensions, this piece likely occupies a volume of roughly 30-40 cm³. Multiplying volume by density gives an estimated weight of about 33-44 grams. Considering some visual uncertainty and the thickness appearing closer to 1.7-2 cm on average, I choose the upper half of this range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the bout de gruyère to be approximately 40 grams."

The image shows a bowl with two distinct portions: white rice on one side and dahl de lentilles corail on the other. The dahl is a dense, thick stew with visible pieces of carrots and onions in a tomato-based sauce. The bowl is medium-sized and filled about halfway with the dahl. Based on visual cues, the dahl occupies roughly half the bowl's volume; given the density of lentil stews (dense legume dish), the weight density is relatively high—close to 0.9-1 g/ml. Swiss portion reference for legume dishes is about 250-350g per serving. Visually, the dahl portion does appear substantial and likely near a full serving. Thus, the dahl de lentilles corail portion likely weighs around 270-300g, and to avoid underestimation due to usual errors with legume dishes, I lean towards the upper half of this range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the dahl de lentilles corail to be approximately 290 grams."

The image shows a bowl of cooked pasta mixed with a creamy mushroom sauce and a side portion of gratinée courgettes. The sauce with mushrooms is visible throughout the pasta, with several thick pieces of mushroom coated in cream. The sauce appears creamy and dense, generously coating the pasta but not forming a large separate quantity. Given the mushroom slices and cream, the sauce volume appears moderate but substantial enough to contribute significant weight. The bowl is medium-sized and holds a single serving; the sauce is integrated with the pasta rather than a separate large portion. Considering Swiss portion ranges do not give a strict standard for mushroom sauce alone but based on ingredient density, I estimate an internal plausible weight range of 60-90 grams. Since the sauce is creamy, dense, and includes whole mushroom pieces, I lean towards the upper half of the range. Therefore, the estimated weight of the ""sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon)"" in this bowl is approximately 80 grams."

The 'cottage cheese aux herbes' is located near the bottom center of the plate and appears to be a small dollop of cottage cheese with visible herb flecks. Cottage cheese is a low-density dairy product, and this portion is relatively modest but clearly more than a mere garnish. Comparing the size of the dollop to the adjacent fried egg (which is a standard size) and the small heap of hummous, it appears to be a substantial spoonful, approximately 2.5-3 tablespoons in volume. Typical cottage cheese density is about 100-110 g per 100 ml, and a tablespoon roughly holds 15-20 grams. Thus, an initial estimate is about 40-60 grams. Considering typical Swiss portions for such side servings and the visible volume, I choose a value in the upper half of this range to avoid underestimation. Therefore, my final estimate for the 'cottage cheese aux herbes' is about 55 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread on a plate, each spread with either butter and jam or butter and Nutella. The specified food item is 'pain' (bread). Each slice appears to be a standard size slice of sandwich bread, roughly rectangular with around 1.5-2 cm thickness. Standard Swiss sandwich bread slices typically weigh about 35-45 grams each depending on density and thickness. Since both slices appear typical and not particularly thin or thick, and given they are whole slices (not partial), I estimate each slice weighs about 40 grams. The image shows two slices, but the task is to estimate just one slice weight, so 40 grams for a single slice is a reasonable and plausible estimate."

The mayonnaise is visible on the plate as a dollop next to the aubergines sautées and the tortilla. It has the thick and creamy texture typical of mayonnaise, and the portion size appears moderate but not very large. Comparing it visually to the size of the tortilla slice and the aubergine slices helps to estimate the volume. The mayonnaise portion looks roughly like about 3 tablespoons or so, which in volume is around 45 ml. Given that mayonnaise has a density close to 0.9-1 g/ml, this suggests a weight of about 40-45 grams. Considering some margin for slight underestimation due to thickness and density, I estimate the mayonnaise weight at approximately 45 grams."

The target food item is 'caviar d'aubergine,' which is the spread on one slice of the 'pain aux graines' (seeded bread) on the top right of the plate. The spread thickness is moderate and covers almost the entire slice, which is around the size of a standard slice of rustic bread, approximately 10cm by 6cm. Eggplant spreads like caviar d'aubergine typically have a density between watery vegetables and denser purees, so we can estimate around 0.7-0.9 g/ml density. The portion looks like about 1.5 to 2 tablespoons (~20-30 ml). This suggests a weight in the range of 20-30 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes and the visible spread thickness and coverage, 25 grams is a reasonable final estimate."

The image shows a plate with a serving of cooked tagliatelle pasta topped with some mushroom cream sauce and accompanied by gratinée zucchinis. The specified food for estimation is 'pâtes' (pasta). Visually, the amount of pasta occupies about a quarter of the plate in a somewhat loose pile. The tagliatelle appear moist and cooked, which increases weight density compared to dry pasta. A typical Swiss cooked pasta portion ranges between 130-220g. Given the modest size visible but considering the moisture and thickness of the pasta ribbons, I would initially estimate around 140-160g. There is no indication that the pasta portion is unusually small, so adjusting to the upper half of the range makes sense. Also, the visible mushrooms on top do not add directly to the pasta weight but confirm some sauce moisture that might add weight. Therefore, my best estimate for the weight of the pasta portion here is approximately 155 grams."

The image shows a small green bowl containing four strawberries ('fraises') of varying sizes, some quite large and plump. A typical medium strawberry weighs about 20-25 grams, but these strawberries appear larger and denser than average. Estimating roughly, the largest strawberry may weigh approximately 40-45 grams, the other large one around 35-40 grams, and the two smaller ones about 20-25 grams each. Adding these together yields a total in the range of 115 to 135 grams. Considering the density and the fact that the strawberries are whole with leaves, I lean towards the upper half of this range. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the strawberries to be approximately 130 grams."

The target food is the ""toast"". The image shows two slices of toasted bread on a plate, each lightly spread with fromage frais. The toast slices appear to be standard commercial sandwich bread size, roughly 10x10 cm each. A single slice of sandwich bread generally weighs around 30-40 grams before toasting, and toasting does not significantly change the weight. Since the toast is partially spread with a thin layer of fromage frais, we only estimate the bread weight itself here. Given two slices, the total weight of the toast alone can be reasonably estimated as approximately 65-75 grams. Choosing a value in the upper half of this range for precision, I estimate the total weight of the toast to be approximately 70 grams."

The image shows a bowl containing cereals with milk. The cereals appear as clusters or granola with visible chunks of chocolate. The milk volume appears to fill roughly half to two-thirds of the bowl, with the cereal floating and partially submerged. Typically, a breakfast bowl portion of granola-type cereal ranges from 30 to 60 grams depending on the serving, with a standard single serving often around 45 grams. The cereal clusters appear moderate in quantity but not densely packed, approximately half the surface area of the bowl is covered by cereal. Considering the milk volume and bowl size, the cereal weight likely falls within 40-55 grams. Since cereals are light and porous but can be dense in clusters, I will choose an estimate in the upper half of that range to account for the clusters and chocolate chunks, resulting in an estimate of about 50 grams for the cereals."

The image shows a small amount of crème caramel in a somewhat shallow, transparent blue bowl held in one hand. The crème caramel appears to fill only the bottom center of the bowl with a thin to moderate layer. Given the typical creamy and dense texture of crème caramel (similar to custard), its density should be close to that of pudding, roughly 1 g/ml. Estimating the visible volume, it looks to be about 100-150 ml or grams, as the portion fills a small area with some slight thickness. Standard dessert portions of crème caramel are usually in the 120-180g range depending on serving size. Considering the small serving shown in the image and the portion filling only a part of the bowl's base, I estimate the crème caramel weighs about 130 grams, which aligns with plausible size and density for this dish."

Given the typical Swiss portion size for cooked rice is approximately 150-250g, and considering the density and volume observed here, the rice portion likely weighs towards the middle-upper range. The dalh portion is dense with visible lentils and vegetables but is not the target item here. Accounting for the bowl size and rice volume, I estimate the rice weight to be approximately 200 grams."

The image shows a slice of bread with a visible layer of crème de marrons spread on top. The bread slice appears to be roughly a small to medium piece, likely around 40-50 grams in weight by itself. The crème de marrons is spread moderately thick across the surface, but not in a thick layer—more a medium thin spread that covers most of the bread's surface. Given the density and moist texture of crème de marrons (similar to a thick jam or purée), its weight per volume is fairly high, likely close to 1 g/ml. The visible spread probably weighs around 20-30 grams considering the size and even coverage. Since crème de marrons is a dense fruit-based spread, there is no need to increase the estimate excessively, but slight adjustment upward is reasonable to avoid underestimation. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the crème de marrons on this bread slice at about 28 grams."

Focusing on the blueberries, they are clustered on the left side of the bowl. There are about 10 visible blueberries, each appearing plump and medium-sized. Typical individual blueberries weigh approximately 0.5 to 1 gram, and Swiss portions for blueberries often range between 150-200 grams, but this is a smaller portion. Since the blueberries are fresh and unprocessed, their density and weight per piece are standard. Estimating around 0.8 grams per blueberry, the total visible portion of blueberries approximates between 8 and 12 grams. Given the visible count and size, I place my final estimate at the higher end of this range, about 10 grams, reflecting the actual visible quantity without assuming hidden amounts."

The avocado ('avocat') portion is clearly visible on the plate as one thick wedge. The size of the wedge compared to the adjacent items like the carrot shreds and bread piece suggests it is about one quarter of a medium avocado. Typically, a whole medium avocado weighs roughly 150-200 grams including the pit and skin, but since only the edible flesh is considered and the pit is excluded, the flesh is approximately 130-170 grams per whole fruit. A quarter slice of this would therefore be around 35-45 grams. Considering the thickness and size of the wedge, I estimate the avocado flesh here weighs near 40 grams, which fits well with the size comparison to other items on the plate and standard portion sizes."

The butter spread appears thin but covers a significant portion of the bread, likely adding around 5-7 grams. The chestnut cream layer is also thin but covers most of the slice, possibly adding about 10-12 grams. Combining these elements, the total weight of the tartine with butter and chestnut cream is estimated to be approximately 45-60 grams.

The image shows four small slices of cheese representing the fromages: manchego, two kinds of gruyères, and raclette. The slices are moderately thick but small in surface area, arranged near a slice of pain provencales for scale. The bread slice appears standard and common in size, roughly similar to a typical small sandwich bread slice (~40-50g). Each cheese slice looks dense and firm, with approximate sizes ranging from 2-4 cm in length and 1-2 cm in width and thickness around 3-5 mm. Typically, cheese density is about 1 g/cm3. Estimating volume roughly for all four pieces combined gives approximately 25-35 cm3 in total volume, translating roughly to 25-35 grams as an initial estimate. Given that cheese can be dense and the slices appear compact, this estimate seems plausible. Also, given the small portion and typical serving sizes for cheese slices in tasting plate portions (usually 30-50g total), this portion is somewhat modest but reasonable. Hence, I estimate the combined weight of the four cheese slices at about 30 grams."

The image shows a clear glass container filled with a mixture of couscous, cucumber chunks, tuna, and visible pumpkin seeds (graines de courge). The pumpkin seeds are dispersed throughout and some are visible clearly on top. Given that pumpkin seeds are small, dense, and typically served as a garnish or mix-in, the volume they occupy in the container is modest compared to the rest of the ingredients. The visible surface layer and scattered seeds suggest a total quantity filling about one small handful spread through the mixture. A typical serving size of pumpkin seeds as a topping or mix-in ranges around 15-30 grams in such contexts. Considering the container size (roughly a small deep dish) and seed distribution, I estimate the total weight of the graines de courge here to be approximately 22 grams."

The image shows a black plate with several distinct components: a pile of oatmeal or porridge-like cereal, chocolate chips, a half banana, and a dollop of peanut purée (purée cacahuète). The peanut purée portion is relatively small compared to the other items, roughly a tablespoon-sized amount spread on top of the cereal. Given that a tablespoon of peanut butter typically weighs about 16 grams and considering a small visible quantity (not a full tablespoon but close), I estimate this portion weighs approximately 15-18 grams. There is no visible container to suggest additional depth or hidden volume, so this direct visual estimate applies. The portion size is plausible given the overall plate size and food distribution, and no reason to significantly increase or decrease this estimate."

The image shows two sandwiches containing visible chicken fillets with some curry sauce mixed with mayonnaise, and green lettuce inside baguette-style bread. The target food is 'sauce curry avec mayonnaise.' The sauce appears to be spread thinly underneath the chicken and around the lettuce inside each sandwich. Based on the visible amount, this sauce is a condiment layer rather than a thick spread or a separate portion. Typically, such a spread would be approximately 10-15 grams per sandwich, given the thin coating on both pieces and the modest visible quantity. For two sandwiches, the total amount would be roughly 20-30 grams. Considering the sauces are dense but thinly spread, I estimate about 25 grams of sauce curry with mayonnaise in total for the visible portion. This fits plausibly with the sandwich size and typical condiment application without exceeding what the image shows."

The image shows a white bowl containing a creamy mixture of blanc battu (a type of dairy similar to quark or yogurt), visibly combined with flocons d'avoine (oat flakes), graines de chia (chia seeds), and some drizzle of miel (honey). The target food item is graines de chia. Visually, the chia seeds appear distributed throughout the mixture, visible as many small black specks. Chia seeds are very small and light: individually very light (around 0.6 grams per teaspoon). Common servings of chia seeds in such preparations tend to be approximately 10-20 grams per bowl serving. Given the amount visible embedded in this portion, I estimate it to be close to one tablespoon (roughly 15 grams, which is a typical chia seed serving). Since chia seeds have low volume but are quite dense and are mixed into the other ingredients, the visible speckling indicates a moderate amount typical for a single serving in such a dish. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the graines de chia in this bowl to be about 15 grams."

The image shows a medium-sized transparent glass bowl containing chocolate yogurt. The yogurt appears to be scooped and is filling approximately half to two thirds of the bowl's volume. Chocolate yogurt is a dense, creamy food with a density close to 1 g/ml. Considering the bowl's diameter and depth, it likely holds about 150-200 ml when half-full, and this serving fills roughly that amount. Given the density and visual fullness, a reasonable estimate for this portion of chocolate yogurt is around 170 grams, which fits typical yogurt serving sizes and volume observed. This estimate also accounts for some air pockets and uneven scooping visible."

The image displays one slice of bread ('pain') on a plate, spread with Nutella. The bread appears to be a medium-thickness slice of whole grain or rye bread, roughly the size of an average slice that typically weighs between 30 and 50 grams. Given the visible size and thickness, this slice looks substantial but not overly thick. Considering Swiss portion sizes for bread slices and the visual observation, I would estimate the weight closer to the upper end of the typical range, around 45 grams, since the slice looks dense and fills most of the plate's part reserved for it."

The image shows a rectangular plastic container partially filled with a Greek salad consisting mainly of diced cucumbers, tomatoes, yellow and green bell peppers, black olives, small pieces of white cheese (likely feta), and some onion rings. The container is about two-thirds full. Given the size of the container relative to the table and the visible depth of the salad inside, it appears to hold a moderate single-serving portion. Greek salad is a dense vegetable and cheese mix, so the weight is higher than it might seem visually. Typical Swiss portion sizes for dense mixed salads range from 200 to 400 grams, with a critical upward adjustment of 40-60% for mixed salads often underestimated. Considering the container size, volume of salad, and density, I'd initially estimate around 180-230 grams. Adjusting upward by about 50% for the dense mixed salad factor brings the estimate to about 270-345 grams. Choosing a value comfortably within the upper half of this range for plausibility and considering some visible dressing and cheese, I estimate the weight of the salade grecque to be approximately 310 grams."

The image shows a hand holding about 18 cashew nuts (noix de cajou). Cashew nuts typically weigh around 1.2 to 1.5 grams each depending on size. Judging by their size relative to the fingers, these appear to be of average size. Multiplying 18 nuts by an average weight of about 1.4 grams gives an initial estimate of around 25 grams. There is no indication of additional hidden nuts or large variance in size. Given this, the total weight of the cashew nuts in hand is approximately 25 grams."

The specified food item is 'vinaigre', which is typically a liquid dressing used in small quantities. The image shows a bowl containing chopped cucumber, chopped tomato, grated carrot, pumpkin seeds, and a dollop of sérac. The vinaigre is visible as a mustard seed-containing dressing lightly drizzled over the vegetables and seeds, but it is not present in a separate volume or bowl. Considering the visual appearance, typical usage for vinegar-based dressings on salads is roughly 10-20 grams per serving. The amount visible here is a thin drizzle coating the vegetables, so it is reasonable to assume a quantity near the lower end of this range. Given it is dispersed but visible over a medium portion bowl, I estimate about 15 grams of vinaigre in this dish."

The image shows a plate with a mixed dish containing rice, cherry tomatoes, peach pieces, corn, asparagus, red kidney beans, tuna, and half of a boiled egg. The egg is clearly visible as one half, showing both white and yolk parts. A standard medium-sized boiled egg weighs approximately 50 grams whole, thus half an egg would weigh around 25 grams. Considering the visible size of this half egg and its appearance, it is reasonable to estimate the weight close to 23-27 grams. Since the egg is cleanly halved and appears fully present, I will estimate the weight at the midpoint of this range, 25 grams."

The image shows a small portion of green salad leaves (salade verte) with some visible dressing or sauce on a white plate. The quantity of leaves is quite minimal, scattered and flattened on the plate, indicating this is a remnant portion rather than a full serving. Typical Swiss portion range for leafy salads is 50-100 grams, recognizing that leafy salads are low density and can appear visually larger than their weight. Given this portion is clearly much smaller than a normal serving, I estimate the weight to be approximately 20-25 grams. The sauce is minimal and not in measurable mass compared to the leaves. This estimate considers the density and light volume of the visible salad leaves on the plate."

The image shows a plate containing a serving of mashed potatoes (purée de pdt), topped with beef ragout meat, carrots, and sauce. Focusing on the mashed potatoes, they occupy a sizable portion of the plate's central area. The portion is thick and covers a moderate surface area roughly 10-12 cm in diameter and about 1.5-2 cm in thickness. Given the density of mashed potatoes (generally around 0.8 g/ml) and the volume visible, my initial rough estimate is around 140-180g. Since mashed potatoes can be denser and heavier than they seem, I lean towards the upper half of this range. Additionally, mashed potatoes are a dense vegetable-based dish, so I apply the critical adjustment to increase the estimate by about 40-60%, pushing it towards approximately 190-230g. Comparing this to Swiss portion references (typical vegetable cooked dish portions 150-300g), this estimate fits well within a plausible range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the purée de pdt portion at approximately 210 grams."

The target food item is ""oeuf au plat"" (fried egg), which is clearly visible on the plate in the bottom left. It appears to be cooked with a fully intact yolk and some seasoning on top. The size of the egg is roughly standard, matching the expected size of a single large hen's egg as found in Swiss servings. Typically, a cooked fried egg weighs around 50-60 grams, accounting for some moisture loss from cooking but overall similar to a raw egg. The egg's shape and thickness look typical without visible excess oil or added components that would increase weight. Given the standard portion size and the visible appearance, I estimate the weight to be about 55 grams, which aligns well with typical fried egg weights. This figure is also consistent when compared to other plate items in size and volume."

The bowl contains a mixed salad of visible green leafy lettuce, chopped tomato, sliced radish, diced apple, and sliced onion. The vinaigre balsamique appears as a dark brown glossy sauce lightly coating the salad surface and some sides of the bowl. Considering typical use, vinaigre balsamique servings generally range between 10 to 20 grams per portion on salads. Visually, the amount corresponds to a few thin spoonfuls evenly distributed. The bowl is a small to medium-sized dish, and the vinaigre balsamique does not pool heavily or appear overly saturated, indicating a modest usage. Therefore, a plausible estimated weight range is approximately 10-20 grams. Selecting a value in the upper half to account for some adherence on the salad bits, I estimate around 16 grams of vinaigre balsamique."

The image shows two slices of whole grain bread ('pain bis') making a sandwich open-faced. On one slice, there are strips of cheese ('fromage') neatly laid out; on top of the cheese, there are two small pickles ('cornichons'). The cheese slices cover most of the bread surface but are relatively thin and cut into strips approximately the length of the bread slice, which appears to be a standard medium-sized slice (~12 cm long). Considering the typical thickness and density of semi-hard cheese commonly used in sandwiches and the visible volume, each strip is thin but there are about 6-7 strips arranged side-by-side. A usual slice of cheese for a sandwich is about 20-25 grams, but here since the cheese is cut into strips and layered on one piece of bread, the total weight of this cheese portion would be around 35-45 grams. Given the visual appearance and standard portion sizes for cheese in a sandwich, I estimate the weight of the cheese ('fromage') to be approximately 40 grams."

A regular chocolate croissant from Swiss or European bakeries generally weighs between 60 and 90 grams. Given its visible size relative to the hand and the moderate thickness of the pastry, it is not unusually large or small. Since the croissant is dense, buttery, and contains chocolate, I estimate the weight near the middle to upper half of the typical weight range for such pastries. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this croissant au chocolat to be approximately 80 grams."

Considering the container size—likely a standard meal prep box around 1.5 liters total volume—and the depth of the bulgur layer (roughly 2-3 cm), this suggests a moderate portion. Typical cooked bulgur portions are around 150-200 grams. Visual volume here corresponds to roughly 140-180 grams. Given the bulgur’s density and moistness, and the visible amount, I will estimate the weight slightly higher toward the upper half of that range. The presence of the boiled eggs and ratatouille occupying the rest of the container provides a scale. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the bulgur is about 170 grams."
