2ahgvr,salade grecque,315.0,650,335.0,11.58215344089562,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/c476a6d0-acb2-45fd-b168-84822bc98003,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a rectangular plastic container filled with a diced Greek salad ('salade grecque'). The salad contains visible chunks of cucumber, tomatoes, yellow and green bell peppers, onions, olives, and small pieces of feta cheese. The container is about half to two-thirds full, with the salad filling up a moderate volume but not densely packed. Considering the size of the container relative to the table and the typical dimensions (estimated roughly 15x10x7 cm), and the salad density being medium (vegetables plus cheese and olives), the volume of the salad is about 700-1000 cubic centimeters occupied. With the mix of vegetables and cheese, a reasonable density for the salad is approximately 0.8 g/cm³. Multiplying the approximate volume by density gives an estimated weight range of about 560 to 800 grams. Given the salad fills roughly 60% of the container and considering some air gaps, I estimate the portion as a medium-sized serving, around 650 grams. The homemade salad dressing visible on the sides is not counted as a separate food item. Therefore, the weight estimation for the 'salade grecque' based purely on visual appraisal is about 650 grams."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,160,257.0,11.762594665788606,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'salade de tomates', which is shown on a medium-sized plate. The tomatoes are cut into roughly quarter and sixth slices and are layered across the plate's surface, appearing fresh and juicy. The volume of the tomato slices corresponds to about one medium to large tomato, considering the plate size and the relative size of the cutlery beside it. The salad is also garnished with some herbs and sprinkled with flax seeds, but these do not add significant weight to the tomatoes themselves. Tomato density is moderate given their high water content. A medium tomato typically weighs around 120-150 grams. Given the volume and layering, this portion looks like approximately 1 to 1.25 medium tomatoes worth of slices. Thus, I estimate the weight of this tomato salad to be around 160 grams."
p96w4a,délice tomate mozzarella,54.0,260,206.0,1.2209417188014489,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/5ebafbd6-315d-44a6-8508-ba143d23adb2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'délice tomate mozzarella', which visually corresponds to the stacked alternating slices of tomato and mozzarella cheese on the left side of the plate. Step 1: Visual identification shows 7 slices of tomato and 6 slices of mozzarella arranged in an overlapping fashion. Step 2: Dimension analysis reveals that each slice is roughly similar in thickness, approximately 0.8 cm, with tomato slices slightly thinner. The total height of the stack is about 5-6 cm, width fits within a normal plate diameter (~20-22 cm), so lengthwise the stacked slices take approximately 12-14 cm of plate length. Step 3: Considering density, fresh mozzarella is a semi-soft, dense cheese weighing about 300 g per 100 cm3, while fresh tomatoes weigh approximately 170-180 g per 100 cm3. Step 4: Estimating volume per slice, tomato slices seem about 7cm long by 4cm wide by 0.6cm thick, about 16.8 cm3 each; mozzarella slices slightly thicker at 0.8cm thickness, about 22.4 cm3 each. Multiplying by slice counts: total tomato volume about 7 * 17 = 119 cm3, total mozzarella volume about 6 * 22.4 = 134.4 cm3. Step 5: Converting volumes to mass estimates using densities: Tomato mass ≈ 119 cm3 * 1.75 g/cm3 ≈ 208 grams, Mozzarella mass ≈ 134.4 cm3 * 3.0 g/cm3 ≈ 403 grams. These rough densities are adjusted down because mozzarella contains water; actual approximate density is about 1.05 g/cm3, so revising mozzarella mass to approx 140 g. So tomato weight around 120-130 g, mozzarella about 130-140 g, total mass for the 'délice tomate mozzarella' dish approximated at 250-270 grams. Considering Swiss portions and visible volume, a medium portion estimate around 260 grams is reasonable. Therefore, the estimated weight of 'délice tomate mozzarella' is 260 grams."
xjvrtk,courgette et oignons,300.0,120,180.0,5.926901547579848,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'courgette et oignons,' which is visible on the left side of the glass container. The courgette (zucchini) pieces are sliced into irregular chunks, mixed with cooked onions. The portion fills about half of the rectangular container's volume. The container is roughly 12 cm by 12 cm in width and length, and the food depth is about 3-4 cm. Given the filling level and the visible volume, the cooked courgette and onions appear slightly softened and moist, retaining significant density. Cooked courgettes and onions combined would weigh more than an equivalent raw portion due to water retention after cooking but also softened form. Considering the vegetable portions, their density, and the typical Swiss portion sizes, this looks like a medium portion. I estimate the weight of the courgette and onions mixture to be around 120 grams."
p8a2w5,artichaut,143.0,300,157.0,2.4641641971243553,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/9b2c7383-a434-4260-ac30-86103e4546ea,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows one whole artichaut placed on a large white plate. Comparing the artichaut's size to the hand and fingers visible holding the plate, it is roughly the size of a medium artichoke, with a typical diameter around 8-10 cm and a compact shape. The artichoke appears cooked or steamed, which typically retains most of its natural density. An average medium artichoke (with outer leaves and inner edible parts) generally weighs between 250 to 350 grams. Given this artichaut's size, shape, and the visual context, it is likely a medium portion. Therefore, I estimate the artichaut's weight to be approximately 300 grams."
xjvrtk,tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe,250.0,115,135.0,3.704313467237405,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/f607625b-a07d-423e-a564-4d96ebadf084,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows one slice of a tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe placed on a plate. The slice is roughly triangular and covers a good part of a standard dessert-sized plate (about 20 cm diameter). The crust is thin and lighter in weight, typical of a tarte flambée base. The topping consists of small pieces of rhubarb and apple distributed evenly, with a creamy, custard-like layer underneath. The depth of the slice appears shallow, around 1-1.5 cm thick including crust and topping. Considering the small diced pieces, and the light but moist filling, the density is moderate but lighter than dense pastry. A full tarte flambée usually weighs between 400-500 grams, and this slice involves about one quarter of the full tart visually. Accounting for some empty edges and slight unevenness, I estimate the slice weight is closer to the lower-medium range of a quarter portion. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this slice of tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe at approximately 115 grams."
2ahgvr,porridge salé,48.0,165,117.0,0.6163977609483042,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a35f3211-3b33-4826-97b8-3af69655dada,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a glass jar with a metal lid containing porridge, labeled as 'porridge salé'. The jar is about 70 mm in diameter according to the lid measurement. The jar is filled roughly to 70-75% of its height with porridge, which is dense and creamy, likely consisting of oats cooked with liquid. Given the jar shape and visible porridge layering, the volume of porridge is approximately 150-180 ml. Considering the density of porridge is close to water but slightly higher due to soaked oats, the weight is close to volume in grams, around 170 grams. Taking into account some air space and slight density variation, the estimate is about 165 grams of porridge without the jar."
p96w4a,purée de pdt,214.0,105,109.0,2.560201953682362,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/828972fc-fa12-4270-a960-fc59367fc91e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a white plate with a serving of purée de pdt (mashed potatoes) underneath a portion of viande ragoût with carrots and sauce. Focusing on the purée de pdt, it occupies a central part of the plate and appears to be approximately 8-9 cm wide and 10-11 cm long. The depth of the purée looks moderate, roughly around 1.5-2 cm thick. Considering the texture and moisture content typical of mashed potatoes, their density is relatively uniform and somewhat compact. By comparing to the size of the plate (standard dinner plate approx. 25 cm diameter) and other items (carrots and chunks of meat), the mashed potatoes form a medium portion. Estimating volume as roughly 9 cm x 10 cm x 1.8 cm = 162 cubic cm, and using typical mashed potato density of about 0.65 g/cm3, the weight estimate is about 105 grams. Given usual Swiss portion sizes and visible volume without excess spread, a weight near this value is reasonable."
6fwmw2,fraises,146.0,60,86.0,1.378114367248381,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/6fwmw2/dish_media/fc43899a-21ef-45e8-95b0-d10af04f9539,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small green bowl containing three strawberries ('fraises'). Step 1: Visual identification - there are exactly three whole strawberries clearly visible, each with their green tops intact. Step 2: Dimension analysis - comparing the strawberries to the size of the bowl and the wooden surface texture, each strawberry appears larger than average, roughly medium-sized. They have a plump volume and visible depth, indicating a solid fruit body rather than undersized ones. Step 3: Density considerations - strawberries have a high water content but are dense enough that a medium strawberry weighs between 15 and 25 grams. Step 4: Portion size calibration - given the visible size of these strawberries, I estimate the largest to be close to 25 grams, the medium around 20 grams, and the smallest around 15 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - totaling these gives approximately 60 grams for the three strawberries. This estimate is consistent with typical medium-large strawberry weights. Therefore, the total weight of the strawberries in the bowl is approximately 60 grams."
xjvrtk,ananas,200.0,280,80.0,1.7561189770606958,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/b41068f9-5a0e-4c11-bf1b-7389d3917889,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a blue plate with several triangular pieces of pineapple (ananas) cut into medium-thick slices. There are 13 visible pineapple pieces of varying sizes, but roughly consistent thickness. Comparing the size of the pineapple pieces to the plate (which appears to be a standard small-to-medium plate) and nearby objects (cork container in the background), each pineapple piece is roughly about 4-5 cm in length and 2-3 cm in thickness. Pineapple is a dense, juicy fruit, and each of these pieces likely weighs around 20-25 grams based on visual volume. Multiplying the approximate average piece weight (22 grams) by 13 pieces gives around 286 grams. Considering slight variation in piece size and minor empty spaces on the plate, a reasonable estimate for the total pineapple weight is approximately 280 grams."
wrah5h,tomates,48.0,120,72.0,0.3793216990451103,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/ee6e8045-59f2-4294-ae6a-1d5695abc176,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small plate with a salad consisting of chopped cucumber and tomatoes. I will focus on the tomatoes as requested. There are about 7 visible pieces of tomato scattered on the plate. Each piece appears to be medium-sized chunks, cut from a regular tomato, with the pieces roughly 3-4 cm in length or diameter. The pieces have visible skin and some flesh, appearing juicy but firm. Tomatoes are moderately dense but contain a lot of water, so their density is closer to that of water, about 0.95 g/ml. Given the pieces' volume, I estimate each chunk weighs about 15-20 grams on average. Multiplying by 7 pieces results in approximately 105 to 140 grams in total. Considering moderate variation and the fact that some smaller pieces are less dense or smaller, I settle on a medium portion weight estimate of 120 grams for the tomatoes on this plate."
ppf8hc,pâtes carbonara,236.0,165,71.0,1.8390955987268138,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/4d4e6539-b86f-4019-b2aa-0c15dbce0667,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with a portion of pâtes carbonara topped with grated gruyère cheese. Step 1: The target item is 'pâtes carbonara', so I focus on the pasta and accompanying carbonara ingredients (cream sauce and bits of ham or bacon). The pasta appears to be a mix of penne and other types, cooked and coated evenly with sauce. Step 2: The portion size covers about half the diameter of a standard-sized dinner plate (approx. 24 cm diameter). The pasta is spread relatively thinly, about 1-1.5 cm thick with some pieces overlapping, indicating medium density. Step 3: Carbonara sauce is creamy and adds weight; the meat bits slightly increase density. Step 4: Considering Swiss portion context and visual size, the pasta portion looks like a medium sized single adult serving. I estimate the cooked pâtes carbonara to weigh around 150 to 180 grams. Step 5: Excluding the grated gruyère on top (which visually adds volume but is not part of the target item) and not counting the plate weight. Balancing the volume and density leads me to estimate 165 grams for the pâtes carbonara portion visible in the image."
wrah5h,tiramisu,72.0,140,68.0,0.537372406980573,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/7b0475df-5b02-4072-abb9-ef75acf0f031,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two slices of dessert on a black plate: a tiramisu on the left and a forêt noire (Black Forest cake) on the right. Focusing on the tiramisu, it appears to be a single slice with visible layers of creamy mascarpone and soaked ladyfingers. The dimensions relative to the plate suggest the tiramisu slice is approximately 10 cm long, 4 cm wide, and about 3.5 cm thick. Tiramisu has a dense and creamy texture but also some airiness due to mascarpone and soaked cake layers, giving moderate density. Based on typical tiramisu density and size, a slice of this volume would weigh between 120 and 160 grams. Considering the moistness and compactness, I estimate the weight of this tiramisu slice to be approximately 140 grams."
wrah5h,gaufre à la patate douce,85.0,150,65.0,0.6064098342662715,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1876b0b6-568d-4583-8186-073df252e6c9,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows four pieces of sweet potato waffles ('gaufre à la patate douce') on a plate, each topped with smoked salmon and a creamy sauce. Focusing only on the waffle portions, the waffles are about 6-7 cm wide and roughly 2 cm thick, judging by the waffle texture and plate size. Each piece is about a quarter of a full waffle. Sweet potato waffles have a moderate density, more dense than a standard wheat waffle due to the sweet potato content. Estimating the full waffle weight: a typical sweet potato waffle would weigh approximately 140-160 grams. Since we have four quarters (one full waffle in total), the total waffle portion weighs approximately 150 grams. Thus, the estimated weight of the sweet potato waffles on the plate is around 150 grams."
wrah5h,porc,52.0,115,63.0,0.3595653605531775,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/f727ac79-973e-4b92-8f2b-cda94222d4a7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'porc', which appears in the bottom left corner of the container. It is a single cooked pork piece covered with a white sauce (crème, moutarde). For visual scale, the container is a typical lunchbox metal tray, about 15cm wide. The pork piece occupies roughly one quarter of the container's bottom area. The thickness of the pork looks approximately 1.5-2 cm. Considering the density of cooked pork (dense meat), a piece of this visible size corresponds to roughly 100-130 grams. The sauce on top adds little to no extra volume or weight since it is a thin coating. Taking these factors into account, a medium portion in a Swiss context and visual evidence points to about 115 grams of pork."
m4egh2,yogourt orange sanguine,170.0,110,60.0,1.1195258478761936,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/9942fa79-be93-458e-b6a9-22fda9333ff4,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item to estimate is 'yogourt orange sanguine'. In the image, the yogourt orange sanguine is mixed thoroughly with the mélange de céréales and myrtilles inside a medium-sized bowl. The overall volume of the mixture fills about 75% of the bowl's depth and surface area. The yogourt component appears creamy and slightly colored from the orange sanguine, distinguishable by the texture and color compared to the cereal flakes and blueberries. Considering Swiss portion norms and typical yogurt container sizes, a standard serving of flavored yogurt in such a bowl would range roughly between 100 and 150 grams. Accounting for the visible mixture density and the fact that the yogourt is partially mixed with cereals and berries, but focusing solely on the yogourt portion by visual volume approximation (about half to two thirds of the mixture volume), I estimate the yogourt orange sanguine weight to be approximately 110 grams."
wrah5h,haricots rouges,91.0,35,56.0,0.5593238941938317,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1550c506-8c95-461f-b658-8f427dc2a0af,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'haricots rouges' (red kidney beans), which are visible on the left side of the plate as a compact pile of cooked beans. Visually, the haricots rouges occupy approximately one-fifth of the plate area. Each kidney bean weighs about 0.5 to 1 gram when cooked. There appear to be around 35 to 40 beans visible here, with some overlapping but likely no significant hidden layers, so I estimate about 40 beans total. Given the density and moisture content of cooked kidney beans, the pile likely weighs around 30 to 40 grams. Considering the moderate portion size and visual density, I estimate the weight of the haricots rouges as approximately 35 grams."
p8a2w5,riz,185.0,130,55.0,1.1167819119745364,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/82b53493-1c97-472b-9ec6-8cc698b8cfe4,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a bowl split into two halves: white rice on the left and dalh de lentilles corail on the right. The bowl is a medium-sized soup bowl, with a visible spoon for size reference. The rice portion appears dense and fills about half the bowl volume. Considering typical density and cooked texture of rice, the volume of rice here is roughly 200-220 ml. Cooked rice typically weighs about 130-140 grams per 200 ml. Given the compact shape, I estimate the rice weight closer to 130 grams. No visible rice spills out of the bowl or is partially hidden. Thus, the weight of the rice alone is about 130 grams."
wrah5h,betterave,65.0,120,55.0,0.39238283393699924,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/bba5cf64-1d08-40cb-bc6c-bfdd2a7c2116,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a light blue plate containing multiple food items: quinoa, diced beetroot (betterave), mango, cucumber, tomato, and sliced avocado. The target food to estimate is betterave. Step 1: Visual Identification - The betterave is located on the left side of the plate, appearing as dark red cubed pieces. I count approximately 14 visible pieces, all roughly uniform cubes about 2-3 cm each. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each beetroot cube is about 2 cm per side, making them roughly 8 cm³ in volume each. The cubes are compact and shiny, indicating a cooked and dense texture. There are no hidden layers underneath visible cubes, so the visible amount likely represents the full portion. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cooked beetroot is dense and moist, similar to cooked root vegetables. Density is roughly 1.1 g/cm³. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Total estimated volume = 14 cubes × 8 cm³ = 112 cm³. Weight estimate = 112 cm³ × 1.1 g/cm³ = about 123 grams. The portion size visually corresponds to a medium portion in Swiss context. Step 5: Cross-validation - This aligns with typical beetroot side serving sizes seen visually on similar plate sizes and portions. Therefore, the best estimate for the betterave weight on this plate is approximately 120 grams."
wrah5h,tomate,46.0,100,54.0,0.27263747118867304,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/712f4686-2c54-47d3-a8f2-811e15f6e76b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'tomate'. Step 1: Visual Identification - The tomato is located in the left portion of the container and appears as about 3 to 4 visible slices or chunks. They are partially overlapped but all appear to be cut relatively thick. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each slice is approximately 4-5 cm wide and 1 cm thick. Compared to the total size of the container and other foods, the tomato pieces occupy about one-sixth to one-fifth of the overall container volume. Step 3: Density Considerations - Tomato is a relatively light and juicy vegetable but with some water weight. Raw tomatoes generally weigh around 100-120 grams per cup (approx 150 grams per 200 ml volume). Considering these factors and the visual volume, the total visible tomato is comparable to roughly a medium tomato weighing about 100 grams. There are no hidden layers underneath; the slices are flat and shallow. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The portion looks medium-sized, not a small garnish nor a large heaping serving. Step 5: Cross Validation - Avoiding common errors, the estimate does not underestimate volume or weight. Hence, the best estimate for the tomato weight is around 100 grams."
2ahgvr,brochette de boeuf,76.0,130,54.0,0.45044451761606846,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/5b8a0853-ecc4-4015-bc9a-2b50766f873a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'brochette de boeuf'. It is located near the top center of the plate, consisting of three visible pieces of grilled beef on a skewer. Each beef piece looks roughly cubical with about 3-4 cm sides and appears dense and grilled. Comparing the size to the bread slice nearby (which is small, about 6 cm wide), the beef cubes are medium-sized pieces typical in Swiss portions. Given the density of cooked beef, about 1 cm thickness and compact volume, each cube probably weighs around 40-45 grams. There are three cubes visible, so total weight is estimated at 120-135 grams. Considering the medium portion size, I select a value around the middle of this range. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'brochette de boeuf' is 130 grams."
m4egh2,sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon),98.0,45,53.0,0.5700801229283284,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/6b91ac4b-1f0f-4176-bf40-a12a6cd892e2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is the 'sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon)'. In the image, this sauce is visually identifiable by the creamy coating on the mushrooms intertwined with the pasta. The sauce volume corresponds roughly to the visible creamy component pervading the mushrooms and some pasta surfaces, but mostly it is on and around the mushroom pieces. Step 1: The visible mushrooms coated in sauce number about 8 to 10 pieces of varying sizes, averaging around 20 grams total for mushrooms alone. Step 2: The sauce itself is the creamy liquid around these pieces; judging by the level of cream coverage and pooling at the bottom of the bowl, I estimate the sauce portion to be about 2-3 tablespoons, roughly 30-45 grams by volume-to-weight conversion (creamy sauces are dense but mostly water). Step 3: Considering that sauce is mixed and not just coating but also fills gaps between pasta and mushrooms, I add some hidden sauce volume underneath and between the pasta layers. Step 4: Combining visible sauce liquid plus hidden amount, the sauce weight should be conservatively placed around 40-50 grams. Taking the middle of that range to be reasonable against the bowl size and food volume, I estimate the total weight of the sauce aux champignons to be approximately 45 grams."

The image shows a single slice of homemade chocolate fondant on a white plate. The slice is triangular, with an average length of about 12-14 cm, a width at the widest part of about 6-7 cm, and a thickness of approximately 3.5-4 cm. Comparing its size to the cup handle in the background provides a good size reference, indicating this is a standard dessert slice typical for one person. Chocolate fondants are dense due to the high chocolate and butter content, so weight is higher than a typical cake slice of the same volume. Given the density and the dimensions, a reasonable weight range for this slice is between 110 and 140 grams. Considering it fills the visible volume with a dense, rich texture, and appears a moderate-sized portion typical of Swiss servings, I estimate the slice weighs about 125 grams."
r3bub9,cacahuètes,38.0,90,52.0,0.21688069366699594,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/r3bub9/dish_media/9fe3d12f-bfa6-421e-a861-be4fba09fc13,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows an open glass bottle containing shelled peanuts ('cacahuètes'), filling roughly one-third of the bottle's volume. The bottle is standing on a kitchen counter and is about the size of a small juice or milk bottle, approximately 15 cm tall with a diameter around 5-6 cm. The peanuts inside appear to be loosely packed without much compression, with visible spaces between them. Based on standard density for shelled dry peanuts, which is about 0.6 g/cm³, and estimating the visible volume occupied at approximately 150 ml (assuming 1/3 of a 450 ml bottle), the peanuts' weight can be approximated as 150 ml × 0.6 g/ml = 90 grams. Accounting for some space between peanuts and slight estimation uncertainty, a weight around 85-95 grams would be reasonable. Considering visual evidence, I estimate the weight of the cacahuètes in the bottle to be 90 grams."

The image shows a white bowl filled with a mixture of rice and dahl de lentille. The dahl is visibly mixed with the rice and contains lentils and some pieces of vegetables such as carrots and onions. The bowl size is medium, typical for a single serving, and it appears filled about 85%, leaving some space at the top. Considering the density of cooked lentil dahl with vegetables (which tends to be dense and moist) and the rice mixed in, the portion looks moderate but substantial. The depth of the bowl is fully filled with the mixture, and given the visual volume and density, the dahl de lentille portion likely weighs approximately 230 grams. This estimate excludes the rice since the target food item is only the lentil dahl component."
ppf8hc,poivrons jaune,150.0,100,50.0,0.8231807704972012,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/95e84def-c82b-4360-8390-f5153ff61064,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'poivrons jaune' (yellow peppers). The image shows one whole yellow pepper stuffed with quinoa and bulgur, and two separated slices of yellow pepper on the plate. To estimate the weight of the yellow peppers only, I consider the visible whole pepper and the two slices. A medium yellow bell pepper typically weighs around 120-150 grams before cooking. Cooking reduces water content slightly and softens the pepper, which seems to be the case here since the pepper is cooked/roasted. The two slices together seem to be roughly one quarter of a medium pepper, so combined with the stuffed pepper body minus filling, the total visible yellow pepper portion is roughly equivalent to one medium pepper minus the cavity occupied by quinoa and bulgur. The cavity is stuffed, so the pepper volume is fully present. Considering the pepper has shrunk slightly due to cooking, but no large pieces are missing, I estimate the total yellow pepper visible (whole plus slices) to weigh about 100 grams. The plate size and fork provide scale, and this weight aligns with Swiss portion sizes for cooked peppers."

The target food is 'délice des dieux,' a dessert comprising biscuit, red fruits, and a creamy mascarpone and séré layer. Visual identification shows a single slice on a small dessert plate. The slice includes visible raspberries and blueberries on top, which can help with size reference. Each raspberry appears typical size (~4g per raspberry), with three raspberries and two blueberries visible. The creamy layer is about 1 to 1.5 cm thick, smooth and dense, while the biscuit layer underneath is moist and about 1.5 cm thick. The overall slice roughly measures about 9 cm long, 7 cm wide, and about 3 cm thick, including all layers. The biscuit is a dense, moist base which adds significant weight, and the cream is dense but lighter than the biscuit. The red fruits add some volume but are relatively light. Applying typical densities and portion sizes for such layered desserts, and factoring in the Swiss portion style which does not necessarily mean smaller here due to normal slice size, the total weight is estimated in a range around 140-170 grams. Given the slice's apparent fullness and density, I estimate the slice weighs approximately 155 grams."

The image shows a single piece of pain aux fruits held between fingers, providing a good size reference. The piece appears roughly square, about 6 cm wide and 1.5 to 2 cm thick, with a dense texture typical of fruit bread containing nuts and dried fruits. The crust has visible sugar crystals and almond flakes, suggesting some added density. Given the density of such bread and the small portion size visible (approximately half a standard slice), a full slice usually weighs around 80-100 grams, so this smaller piece likely weighs between 40 and 60 grams. Considering the thickness and density, a weight of approximately 50 grams is a reasonable estimate for this piece of pain aux fruits."

The image shows a white plate containing portions of ratatouille, bulgur, gruyère cheese sticks, and a fried egg. The target food is ratatouille, which is located at the top right of the plate as a mixed vegetable stew with visible pieces of zucchini, eggplant, tomato, and possibly bell pepper. Step 1: Visual identification shows one single portion of ratatouille. Step 2: Dimension analysis reveals the ratatouille portion covers an area roughly 6x5 cm and about 2-3 cm in height (slightly piled). Comparing with the fried egg (about 10 cm diameter) and bulgur grains, the ratatouille portion appears moderately sized, not sparse or overly heaped. Step 3: Considering density, ratatouille is cooked vegetables stewed together, typically dense and moist, but with some softness and water content, so density is moderate, not as dense as meat but more dense than raw vegetables. Step 4: Portion size calibration, the volume suggests a medium portion typical of a side vegetable dish. A rough internal weight estimate range would be between 120 and 180 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation against typical Swiss side vegetable portions confirms this estimate. Taking all aspects into account, I estimate the weight of the ratatouille portion on the plate to be approximately 150 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing cereals mixed with milk. The cereals appear to be flakes and clusters with some small pieces of chocolate. The cereal layer covers the bottom of the bowl with a thin to medium spread, and given the bowl's size (typical medium cereal bowl about 15-18 cm diameter), the depth of the cereal itself appears quite shallow—roughly around 1 to 1.5 cm thick on average. Considering the milk volume visible and the cereal floating on top and submerged partially, I estimate the cereal volume is modest. Given the density of typical mixed cereals (flakes and small clusters) is about 0.3-0.5 g/ml, and factoring in the visual density and volume, the total cereals likely weigh around 30 to 40 grams. Choosing a middle estimate based on the visible portion and the bowl size, I estimate the cereals weigh approximately 35 grams."

The salade de céleri is located on the bottom right of the plate. It appears as a small mound of finely grated white celery root, lightly dressed. Visually, the portion is compact but not dense due to the shredded texture and some air space. Comparing its size to the adjacent carrot salad and the potato salad portion, it seems smaller in volume than both. The plate size is a typical small Swiss lunch plate, about 20-22 cm square, so the celery salad portion has roughly a volume similar to about 120-150 ml. Celery root shredded and dressed has an estimated density around 0.6-0.7 g/ml due to its fibrous nature and dressing moisture. Multiplying estimated volume by density gives a rough range of 72 to 105 grams. Given a medium portion appearance that is neither sparse nor piled high, I select a middle-ground estimate of 90 grams for the salade de céleri."

First, the target food is 'mozarella.' In the image, the mozzarella is a single round piece placed on the plate to the top left. It has a smooth, creamy texture typical of fresh mozzarella, and it appears to be slightly flattened but thick, roughly 7-8 cm in diameter and about 1.5-2 cm thick. There is some liquid around it, indicating moisture but no significant depletion of volume. Given the typical density of fresh mozzarella, which is quite dense due to its high moisture and protein content, and the visible size, this portion aligns with a small to medium serving. Disposable cutlery is absent, but the plate size and olives provide a reference; each olive is roughly 3-4 grams, and there are 7 olives forming a small cluster. The mozzarella is about 3-4 times the volume of the olives visible here. Taking these factors into account, typical fresh mozzarella of this size weighs around 90-120 grams. I estimate the mozzarella here to weigh approximately 110 grams, considering the moderate thickness and size visible."

The target food item is 'chili,' which is the reddish-brown bean and meat mixture served on the right half of the plate. Visually, it contains chunks of cervelas sausage, kidney beans, and a thick tomato sauce. The chili portion covers about half of a standard small dinner plate (approximate diameter 24 cm). The visible chunks of cervelas are around 2-3 cm each, with roughly 10-12 noticeable pieces including those partly submerged in sauce, indicating some hidden volume beneath the visible top layer. The dish looks moist and dense, typical for chili with sausage and beans, which are quite dense ingredients. Considering the layers and density, the chili portion likely has a volume comparable to about 200-250 grams of cooked chili. Given the moderate thickness and the contents, and accounting for sauce density, I estimate the chili weight to be around 230 grams."

The image shows a single rectangular waffle placed on a medium-sized plate. The waffle appears to be a typical homemade or bakery-style waffle with a thickness of about 1.5 cm, judging by the visible depth and usual size of the plate. The waffle has a firm, baked appearance indicating it is cooked through but not overly dense. Normally, such waffles weigh around 80-100 grams each, given this size. Since this waffle is not overly thick or large, I estimate it closer to the lower-middle range. I therefore estimate the weight of the waffle (gaufre) to be about 85 grams."

The image presents a single peeled carrot placed on a countertop. The carrot has a typical medium size, approximately 15 cm long and about 3-4 cm in diameter at its thickest point. Given the shape and density of a peeled carrot, which is firm and dense, and using typical Swiss portion contexts, one medium-sized peeled carrot generally weighs between 100 and 150 grams. This carrot is not small nor exceptionally large, so I estimate it to be a medium portion, closer to the middle of that range, at around 130 grams."

The target food item is 'houmous au basilic (acheté)' which is visible in a small clear glass next to the main plate. The glass appears to be about the size of a standard small drinking glass, roughly 7-8 cm high and 5-6 cm in diameter. The hummus fill level is about 60-70% of the glass volume. Given typical commercial hummus density is close to 1 g/cm³ (similar to thick pastes), and the glass likely holds around 100-120 ml total, the hummus portion is approximately 60-80 grams. Visually, the portion is small and consistent with a side serving of hummus. Therefore, based on these size and density evaluations, the best estimate for the weight of the houmous au basilic is about 70 grams."

The target food item is 'fromage de brebis/chèvre (2 bouts)', which corresponds to the two small pieces of goat/sheep cheese visible on the plate. These pieces are located near the center-bottom of the plate, appearing smaller than the larger cheese slices but distinct with creamy and crumbly textures typical of goat or sheep cheese. Each piece seems to be roughly 3-4 cm long, about 2 cm wide, and approximately 1.5 cm thick when considering their three-dimensional form. Goat and sheep cheeses generally have medium density—denser than soft cheeses like brie but less dense than aged hard cheeses. Estimating each piece in the range of 20-30 grams due to their compact volume, and considering there are two pieces, the total weight is about 40-60 grams. Based on the visual size, density, and Swiss context where portions tend to be moderate but not necessarily small, I estimate the total weight of the two bouts of fromage de brebis/chèvre to be approximately 50 grams."

The image shows four distinct slices of cheese and a slice of seeded bread on a white plate, with the target food being the fromages (manchego, two sortes de gruyères, raclette). The slice sizes vary, with the largest piece roughly 6-7 cm long and about 2-3 cm wide, and the smallest piece approximately half that size. The cheeses appear to be firm and dense, typical for these cheese types, which means their weight is substantial relative to volume. The thickness seems to be around 0.5 cm on average. Considering the density and size, each slice likely weighs between 15-25 grams. Summing the four slices, the total estimated weight is approximately 70 grams, factoring in visible thickness and standard cheese density.

The image shows exactly three vegetarian gyozas placed on a standard-sized white square plate. Each gyoza is approximately 7-8 cm in length, typical of dim sum or Japanese-style dumplings. The thickness appears moderate with a visible filling inside but not overly bulky, indicating typical vegetable filling density. Considering the thin dough wrapper and the mainly vegetable filling, the density is lower than meat gyozas but still moderate due to the stuffing. A typical single vegetarian gyoza weighs around 30-35 grams. This estimate aligns with known portion sizes for frozen or restaurant gyozas. Given this visual evidence and counting exactly 3 pieces with no hidden layers, the total weight is approximately 90-105 grams. Choosing a medium portion weight based on visual size, I estimate the total weight of the 3 vegetarian gyozas to be 95 grams."

The target food is 'avocat' which is avocado. In the image, there are clearly two halves of avocado slices visible on the galette wrap. Each slice is approximately 8-10 cm long and about 2-3 cm wide, with visible thickness suggesting a typical avocado slice thickness of about 1.5-2 cm. The avocado is fresh and dense, with skin removed, so the full edible portion's weight is what counts. Comparing the slices to the size of the galette wrap (approx 20-22 cm diameter) and the fork beside the plate helps to estimate the avocado quantity. The avocado slices present correspond roughly to half an average-sized avocado, which typically weighs around 150 g whole, with about 70-80 g of edible flesh per half. This portion looks like a medium-sized half portion of avocado, so the weight estimate is around 70 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes and the visible density of the slices, 70 g is a reasonable estimate for the avocado portion shown."

The bowl is of medium size, roughly around 12-15 cm diameter, judging by the laptop keyboard behind it for scale. The yogurt height is estimated at around 3 cm in the bowl, yielding a moderate volume. Considering typical density of yogurt (~1 g/ml) and the presence of fruit pieces which add slightly to the density, the total weight can be approximated by estimating volume in ml. The filled portion corresponds to about 150 ml of yogurt. Given the industrial nature, standard single serving yogurt pots in Swiss contexts commonly contain around 125-150 g per serving. Therefore, balancing visual volume and density, the weight of the apricot industrial yogurt with pieces is best estimated at about 140 grams."

Step 2: The glass container is medium-sized, roughly about 12x12 cm wide and about 6 cm deep. The tuna pieces appear to occupy around 20-25% of the total volume of the food mixture. Step 3: Tuna is dense, and flaked pieces with slight moisture typically have a density close to 1 g/cm3. Step 4: Estimating volume of tuna based on visible surface and assumed hidden pieces, I approximate roughly 120-140 grams of tuna in total. Step 5: Choosing a middle value, the 'thon' in this portion is approximately 130 grams by weight."

Using the hand as a reference for size, the pear appears to be medium-sized, roughly the length from the base of the fingers to the tip of the middle finger, approximately 12-14 cm. The pear is typical in shape with moderate girth, suggesting average density and volume for a fresh fruit of this type. Considering that medium pears in Switzerland usually weigh between 150 to 200 grams, and taking into account this pear's visible fullness and size, I estimate the weight of this pear to be around 170 grams."

The target food item is 'boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate'. Visually, there are nine vegetable meatballs on the plate, coated in tomato sauce. Each meatball is roughly the size of a small golf ball, around 3-4 cm in diameter. Given they are vegetable-based, their density is moderately high but less than pure meat. Estimating an average weight per meatball around 30-35 grams is reasonable. Multiplying by nine pieces results in a total between 270 and 315 grams. The tomato sauce coating adds minimal extra weight, so it is included within the meatball estimate. Conservatively, given Swiss portion sizes and the visible volume, I estimate the total weight of the vegetable meatballs in tomato sauce to be about 290 grams."

The bulgur forms a compact mound that appears to be roughly 7cm wide, 5cm deep, and at a thickness of about 2.5-3 cm, judging by the side profile of the container and the visible grain size. The bulgur grains are dense and cooked, so the density is moderate to high. Given the volume estimated, and considering cooked bulgur has a density roughly around 0.85 g/cm3, the estimated weight for this portion is in the range of 130 to 160 grams. Judging by the amount filling the container and the compactness, this looks like a medium-sized portion. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the bulgur to be approximately 145 grams."

The bowl itself is of average size, approximately 15 cm in diameter, as gauged by the nearby spoon. The cereal pieces occupy about 20-30% of the bowl's volume, with some submerged in milk. Considering the density of granola-like cereal (approximately 0.3-0.4 g/cm3) and the size of the clusters, the visible amount of cereal appears to correspond to around a small to medium portion. Typical grocery servings for such cereals range between 30-50 grams per bowl. Taking into account the visible volume, chocolate pieces, and wet absorption by milk, I estimate the weight of the cereals alone in this bowl to be approximately 40 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread (pain) on a plate, each spread with either butter and jam or Nutella. Both slices are roughly rectangular with a typical slice size for Swiss bread about 10-12 cm in length and 7-8 cm in width, with a thickness of about 2-2.5 cm. The bread appears to be a standard white or light whole grain bread, with an airy crumb structure but a firm crust. Considering the density typical for such bread, which is approximately 250-300 grams per 1000 cm³, and estimating the volume of one slice roughly as length × width × thickness (around 10x7.5x2.2 cm = 165 cm³), the estimated weight for one bread slice is approximately 165 cm³ × 0.27 g/cm³ ≈ 45 grams. Both slices appear to be full slices without pieces missing or significantly thinner edges, so their weight should be similar. Therefore, estimating the weight of one slice of bread ('pain') shown in the image is about 45 grams."

The image shows a single chocolate chip cookie placed on a granite countertop. There are visible chocolate chunks embedded within the cookie. By comparing the cookie size to the common granite tile pattern and texture, the cookie's diameter appears to be approximately 7-8 cm. Its thickness is about 1.5 to 2 cm based on the visible edge shadows and the cookie's texture. Considering that chocolate chip cookies tend to have a moderate density due to flour, sugar, butter and chocolate, the estimated density corresponds roughly to 0.9 to 1 gram per cubic centimeter. Given these dimensions — approximately 7.5 cm diameter and 1.7 cm thickness — the volume is about 70 cm³. Multiplying by density, the cookie's weight is estimated around 65 to 70 grams. Since the cookie looks fairly thick and dense with chocolate pieces, I estimate the cookie weighs about 68 grams."

The target food item is 'avocat'. Looking at the image, the avocado is a single slice located at the bottom left side of the plate. Visually, it appears to be a thick wedge about 7 cm long, 3 cm wide, and moderately thick (~2.5 cm). Considering avocado's density, which is quite creamy and dense, a slice of this size generally weighs around 45-60 grams. This wedge represents roughly one-quarter to one-third of a whole medium avocado, which typically weighs around 150-180 grams unpeeled. Since the seed is not included, and the slice includes peel edges, the estimate should reflect just the edible portion shown. Judging by visual volume and typical Swiss portion size, I estimate the avocado slice's weight to be approximately 50 grams."

The image shows a glass bottle of ginger tonic water on a table. The bottle is a common small glass type, appearing to hold roughly 20 to 25 centiliters of liquid. Comparing its size to the nearby drinking glass and smartphone, a typical small glass beverage bottle in Switzerland usually contains about 200 to 250 ml of liquid. Since the density of tonic water is close to water, 1 ml approximately equals 1 gram. The bottle appears almost full, so the weight of the ginger tonic inside the bottle is close to the volume in grams. Considering slight variation for the liquid carbonation and residual gas, I estimate the tonic au gingembre weighs approximately 220 grams (ml) in the bottle."

The image shows a glass bowl filled with chocolate yogurt. The yogurt is creamy and fills roughly half of a small to medium-sized glass bowl. Given the bowl size and comparing to the typical thickness and volume of yogurt, the amount visibly corresponds to a modest serving. Chocolate yogurt is dense but not as dense as solid or semi-solid items; it has a creamy, soft texture. The portion appears to be about 150-180 ml in volume; since the density of yogurt is close to water (approximately 1 g/ml), the weight should be nearly equal to the volume in grams. Considering some slight settling and air pockets, the estimated weight is around 160 grams. Since the input specifies 'yogourt chocolat' repeatedly but the target food is only one: yogourt chocolat, I estimate one serving as around 160 grams."

The image shows a single slice of toasted bread (tartine) with some spread on top, identified as chestnut cream (crème de marrons) and butter (beurre). The tartine size is relatively small, roughly the size of a typical breakfast toast slice, about 10 cm long and 5-6 cm wide. The thickness of the bread slice is around 1 to 1.5 cm. A typical slice of light toasted bread weighs about 25-30 grams. The spread of chestnut cream and butter is visible but applied thinly, covering roughly 75% of the surface. The chestnut cream has a medium density similar to jam, and the butter adds some additional weight, but the overall layer is thin, possibly around 5 grams combined. Therefore, the bread itself weighs approximately 28 grams and the spreads combined around 5 grams, making the total weight of the tartine with chestnut cream and butter about 33 grams."

The target food item to estimate is 'oeuf' (egg). Visually, the egg is scrambled and placed on a small square plate along with chopped tomatoes, avocado, and two folded wraps. The scrambled egg portion looks compact but not densely packed, covering a modest area approximately 7 cm by 4 cm and about 1 to 1.5 cm thick. Given that a typical whole medium egg weighs about 50 grams, and this portion represents roughly a whole egg's worth scrambled and slightly spread out. There is no visible shell or excess liquid, so only the edible cooked egg portion is counted. The egg appears fully cooked and portioned as one single serving rather than a fraction. Considering Swiss portion sizes and the visual volume, the estimated weight for the scrambled egg is around 50 grams."

The image shows a black bowl containing porridge topped with raspberries, blueberries (myrtilles), dark chocolate chips, and a dollop of peanut butter. The target food item to estimate is the blueberries (myrtilles). Visually, there are about 11 whole blueberries visible, with some small ones potentially hidden underneath or obscured by other toppings. The blueberries are medium-sized, typical for fresh blueberries, approximately 1.5-2 cm in diameter each. A single fresh blueberry weighs roughly 1 gram. The blueberries are grouped on one side of the bowl and slightly overlap but do not appear piled in multiple layers. Considering a small margin for hidden berries, the total count can be estimated around 12 blueberries, leading to an estimated weight range of about 11-13 grams. Taking a middle value and respecting Swiss portion norms, the estimated weight of the blueberries is approximately 12 grams."

The image shows a peeled banana that is about half the typical length of a full banana, positioned on a flat and textured surface for scale. Bananas usually range from 15 to 20 cm in length whole, and this peeled piece looks approximately 7-8 cm long. The diameter appears consistent with a typical banana, roughly 3-4 cm thick. Assuming uniform density and volume for the peeled banana, a standard medium banana weighs around 120-135 grams. Since this piece is roughly half the length, the weight should be about half as well, around 60-70 grams. Considering the typical density and the peeled state (no peel weight), and visual depth/volume cues, the weight estimate is approximately 65 grams."

The target food item is 'sauce oignons,' which is visible as a layer of cooked onions with sauce on top of the slices of rôti (roast meat) on the plate. The sauce onion portion is spread thinly on about two medium slices of roast beef. Considering that the roast slices are about 1 cm thick and about 8 cm in length and 5 cm in width, the sauce covering the meat is relatively thin but moist. The volume of the onion sauce would be roughly equivalent to a small ladle covering the meat. Onions cooked in sauce have moderate density but are fairly light due to water content. Estimating the sauce's thickness around 0.5 cm covering about 40 cm² (area of both slices combined), this gives a volume near 20 cm³. Considering the density of cooked onions with sauce around 1 g/cm³, the total weight should be about 20 grams. Given slight variations and moist content spreading on the plate edges, a small margin leads to an estimate of approximately 20 grams for the sauce oignons."

The image shows a single petit feuilleté (puff pastry) filled with tomato sauce on a wooden surface. The feuilleté is small, roughly about 4-5 cm long, 3-4 cm wide, and appears about 2-3 cm thick based on the visible layers of puff pastry and sauce filling. The texture and density of puff pastry are relatively light but the tomato sauce filling adds some moist weight. Given its size and typical density of puff pastry snacks, such a piece likely weighs between 25 and 35 grams. Considering the visible volume and depth and that it appears fully baked with some caramelization at edges, I estimate this feuilleté sauce tomate to be about 30 grams."

The target food item is 'crème de marrons', visible as a spread on a piece of bread ('pain'). Focusing only on the crème de marrons, I see it covers most of the bread slice but not very thickly. The bread slice is roughly 10 cm long and about 4-5 cm wide, and the crème de marrons appears as a thin yet glossy layer that seems about 3-5 mm thick. Crème de marrons is a dense, thick chestnut spread, so the weight corresponds closely to volume. Calculating volume as area (about 40-50 cm²) multiplied by thickness (~0.4 cm) gives roughly 16-20 cm³ volume. The density of chestnut spreads is close to 1.2 g/cm³ due to sugars and texture. Thus, estimated weight is about 20-24 grams. Considering slight irregularities and the spread's partial coverage, I estimate the total weight of the crème de marrons in this image to be approximately 22 grams."

The target food item is 'pâtes' (pasta). In the image, the pasta is tagged with mushrooms in a cream sauce; the pasta is a cooked ribbon style, likely tagliatelle or fettuccine. The pasta serving is visible as a loose pile occupying a quarter to a third of a standard-sized dinner plate. The strands are not densely packed but overlapping, and some sauce-covered mushrooms are on top. Using the plate diameter (usually about 25 cm) as a reference, the piled pasta area is roughly 8-10 cm in width and 3-4 cm in visible height. Cooked pasta is dense and weighs roughly 150-170g per cup (cooked). This portion visually corresponds to about 1 cup of cooked pasta, not more. Considering some pasta strands are partly covered by sauce and mushrooms, and accounting for possible variations, the total portion is moderate, neither minimal nor overly large. Therefore, estimating conservatively with Swiss portion size in mind, the pasta likely weighs around 120-140 grams. Selecting a middle-ground estimate, I assess the visible pasta weight at about 130 grams."

The image shows a sandwich with two slices of pain bis bread. The target food is 'fromage' which is arranged as thin strips on one slice of bread. There are about 8 thin strips stacked relatively flat, covering most of the bread slice. The bread slice is medium-sized (typical Swiss bread slice roughly 12x8 cm). Each cheese strip is thin and of moderate width and length, appearing to be around 10 cm long and 1.5 cm wide. The thickness of each strip is about 2-3 mm. Swiss semi-hard cheese (such as Emmental or Gruyère) has a density of about 1.0 g/cm³. The total volume can be roughly estimated as: 8 strips × 10 cm × 1.5 cm × 0.25 cm thickness ≈ 30 cm³. Considering density around 1 g/cm³, this is about 30 grams. The cheese is not piled heavily, just evenly spread in strips, no hidden volume under the strips. Hence, the estimated weight of the fromage is approximately 30 grams."

The target food is 'perle de blé' which is visible as small round grains mixed with shrimp and sauce in the bowl. First, the grains cover roughly a third of the bowl’s base and are mixed with creamy yellow sauce. The bowl is medium-sized and the portion of perle de blé appears dense but not overly compacted, roughly filling a volume similar to a small cup. From visual comparison, the quantity seems moderate—there are enough grains to clearly cover the plate area, but not piled high. Considering that cooked wheat pearls have a density somewhat like rice or small pasta and are moist with sauce, a reasonable volume estimate is about 120-140 grams. Taking the middle of this range, adjusted for visible portion and moisture, I estimate the weight of the perle de blé at 130 grams."

The target food item is 'vinaigre', which is a liquid condiment visible as a light dressing over the cucumber, tomato, and carrot salad in the bowl. Visual cues show that the vinaigre is drizzled modestly, covering parts of the vegetables but not pooling heavily. Considering the size of the bowl (medium-sized, approximately similar to a regular soup bowl), the vinaigre appears to be used rather sparingly. Typically, a salad dressing serving in such a portion would range between 10-20 grams, with lower volumes used on salads focused on fresh vegetables. Given the visible thin layer and light drizzle without accumulation, the estimated vinaigre weight is closer to the lower end of this range. Therefore, I estimate the vinaigre amount to be about 12 grams."

Both sandwiches are roughly 12-15 cm long, typical for small baguettes. The sauce layer is thinly spread, visible as a yellowish layer beneath the chicken and lettuce. Considering Swiss portion sizes and that sauces are typically applied sparingly, each sandwich likely contains about 10-15 grams of sauce. Since there are two sandwiches, the total sauce amount is roughly 20-30 grams. Given the thickness and visible coverage, I estimate the total weight of the curry sauce with mayonnaise to be about 25 grams."

The target food is 'yogourt nature,' which is the plain yogurt spread on the slice of whole wheat bread. Visually, the yogurt layer covers the entire slice of bread with a medium-thick spread, not too thin or overly thick. The slice of bread measures about the size of a small piece of whole wheat bread, roughly 10 cm by 7 cm, with the yogurt spread around 3-5 mm thick. Considering yogurt's density is close to water (about 1 g/ml), and estimating volume by surface area times thickness gives approximately 70 cm² times 0.4 cm = 28 cm³, which is roughly 28 grams. The visible spread is uniform, so no hidden volume is missed. Based on Swiss portion sizes and this visual evidence, a reasonable estimate for the weight of the plain yogurt is around 25-30 grams. I therefore estimate the 'yogourt nature' weighs about 28 grams."

Each cashew nut typically weighs around 1.2 to 1.5 grams given their dense, firm texture. Visually, these cashews range slightly in size but mostly appear medium-sized. Given the density of nuts and the compact volume in the hand, the total weight likely falls toward the mid-to-high end of the typical per-nut weight range. Multiplying 18 nuts by about 1.3 to 1.4 grams gives a rough total range of 23 to 25 grams.

The target food is 'purée cacahuète' (peanut butter) visible as a small dollop on the plate's left side. Step 1: Visual identification - the peanut butter appears as a smooth, creamy spread in one small portion, not mixed or layered with other foods. Step 2: Dimension analysis - relative to the banana half and the chocolate chips nearby, the peanut butter portion is about 2-3 cm in length, roughly 1.5-2 cm wide, and a typical spread depth might be around 0.5-0.7 cm. Step 3: Density considerations - peanut butter is dense and sticky, so its volume translates to a relatively high weight. Step 4: Portion size calibration - the dollop corresponds roughly to a tablespoon serving or slightly less. One tablespoon of peanut butter typically weighs about 15-17 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - given the size and density observed here, and the visual comparison with the other items, this portion is moderate but not large. Therefore, I estimate the peanut butter portion as approximately 16 grams."

The target food is 'caviar d'aubergine', which is the spread on one of the slices of pain aux graines (seed bread) on the plate. The slice is a medium thickness, about standard slice size (around 10-12 cm long and 5-6 cm wide). The spread is evenly applied and appears to be about 2-3 mm thick, covering almost the entire surface of the bread slice. Given that caviar d'aubergine is a relatively light spread (mainly puréed eggplant with some oil and seasoning), its density is moderate but less dense than cheeses or meats. A typical density estimate for such a spread is approximately 0.8 g/cm³. The surface area of the bread slice can be estimated roughly as 60-70 cm². With an average thickness of about 0.25 cm (2.5 mm), the volume is approximately 15-18 cm³. Multiplying volume by density gives a weight range of about 12 to 15 grams. Given the moderate thickness and full coverage, the spread's estimated weight is around 14 grams. This estimate accounts for the Swiss portion context and is visually consistent with the volume and coverage seen on the bread slice."

The image shows one piece of dark chocolate ('chocolat noir') resting on a surface. It appears to be a single broken segment of a larger chocolate bar. The size of the segment can be roughly approximated by comparing it to common chocolate bar segment dimensions. Typically, a standard rectangular chocolate segment weighs around 10 to 15 grams depending on thickness and density. This piece is moderately thick with a typical density for dark chocolate, which is quite dense. Considering the visible size and shape, and the fact it seems to be a single segment with slight breakage, I estimate its weight to be on the lower-middle side of the range, around 12 grams."

The image shows two small chocolate figures shaped like rabbits. They are placed on a table, and the texture and shape suggest they are solid milk chocolate. Each rabbit appears to be about the size of a small Easter chocolate, approximately 4-5 cm tall and about 2.5-3 cm wide. Given the compact shape and typical density of milk chocolate, such a figure would generally weigh between 15 and 25 grams. Since these are small and not hollow but solid, and considering Swiss portion sizes for similar chocolates, I would estimate that each chocolate rabbit weighs around 20 grams."

The target food is 'oignon,' which in the image appears as small chopped green pieces sprinkled on top of a slice of bread with ham and balsamic cream. Visually, the quantity of onion is quite small, likely finely chopped green onion or scallion pieces rather than a significant onion portion. The pieces cover a small surface area and are about 2-3 mm thick, scattered sparsely over the ham slice. Given their size and low density compared to other vegetables, this small amount of onion likely weighs between 5 to 10 grams. Considering the sparse distribution and typical portion sizes for garnish onions, a mid-to-lower range estimate around 7 grams is appropriate."

The target food item is ""bout de gruyère,"" which is the rectangular piece of cheese placed centrally on the plate. Step 1: Visual Identification - There is one single piece of gruyère cheese, visibly distinct and not mixed with other items. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Compared to the other items on the plate (such as the baguette slices, croissants, and carrot sticks), the gruyère piece measures approximately 12 cm in length, 2 cm in width, and around 1 cm in thickness based on relative scale to the fork and plate size. Step 3: Density Considerations - Gruyère is a dense cheese with a density roughly around 1.1 g/cm³. Calculating volume (12 cm x 2 cm x 1 cm = 24 cm³) and multiplying by density gives approximately 26 grams. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The piece is a moderate portion given the plate context, so 26 grams is reasonable. Step 5: Cross-validation - The estimate aligns with typical serving sizes of cheese wedges found in Swiss portions and looks proportionate to the other items. Therefore, the estimated weight of the ""bout de gruyère"" is about 26 grams."

The image shows a small blue bowl held by a hand, containing crème caramel. There is no visible caramel sauce on top, only the creamy custard portion. The bowl appears to be a small dessert bowl, with a diameter roughly comparable to the width of the fingers holding it, suggesting a diameter of about 10-12 cm. The crème caramel has a smooth custard texture, filling the bottom of the bowl to an estimated depth of approximately 1.5 to 2 cm. Given the dimensions, the volume of the crème caramel is modest, approximately 100-130 ml. Considering the custard density is close to that of water with some thickness (about 1.03 g/ml), the weight should be slightly above the volume in grams. Therefore, estimating the weight at around 110-130 grams is reasonable. Given the relatively shallow amount present and small bowl size, I estimate the weight of the crème caramel at approximately 120 grams."

The image shows a white plate with four distinct food items: a dollop of mayonnaise (target item), sautéed eggplants, a piece of tortilla, and a portion of salade russe. The mayonnaise is on the left side of the plate in a small, thick swirl that occupies roughly a 6 cm by 4 cm area and is about 1.5 cm thick, as judged by its volume and the shadow it casts. Mayonnaise is dense and creamy, so it weighs more than its volume might suggest. Comparing the mayonnaise size to the standard fork next to the plate and the eggplant slices, the dollop appears to be a small serving typical for a side condiment portion. Given Swiss portion standards and visual volume, the mayonnaise is likely around 20 to 25 grams. Considering the density and the visible amount, a middle-range estimate of 23 grams is reasonable."

The image shows a plate divided mainly into three portions: fusilli pasta, a chili con carne style mixture containing chunks of cervelas sausage, kidney beans, and sauce, and a small amount of crème fraîche. The cervelas pieces are visible as pinkish chunks embedded within the chili mixture. There are about 8-10 distinct cervelas pieces visible on top, each about 2-3 cm in size and quite thick, noting that some may be partially submerged or underneath the top layer of chili, so the total cervelas volume is likely larger than what is directly visible. Cervelas is a dense cooked sausage, so the weight per piece is moderately high compared to their size. Considering the size of the plate and the chili portion which occupies roughly half the plate including the cervelas pieces, I estimate the total cervelas amount to be about 120-150 grams. Choosing a medium portion size based on visual volume and density, the estimated weight for the cervelas is around 135 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing a single scoop of vanilla ice cream ('boule de glace vanille') covered partially with a chocolate sauce and accompanied by a portion of a reddish fruit compote. Focusing on the vanilla ice cream scoop, it's roughly spherical, about the size of a standard ice cream scoop which typically ranges between 50 and 70 grams in Swiss servings. The scoop diameter appears to be around 5-6 cm, comparable to a small ball, and the texture looks dense but soft, which aligns with standard ice cream density. The chocolate sauce on top adds minimal weight which is excluded from this estimate. Based on visual reference to the bowl size and the compote alongside, I estimate the single vanilla ice cream scoop weighs approximately 60 grams, positioning it in the medium portion size for Switzerland."

The image shows a small handful of green salad leaves ('salade verte') on a white plate with some visible dressing or sauce remnants. The leaves are spread thinly and appear to be primarily iceberg or similar lettuce, which is very light. The total volume on the plate is limited, roughly corresponding to a few medium-sized leaves torn into pieces. Given the typical density and water content of lettuce, and based on the visual size compared to the plate, this portion likely weighs between 10 and 20 grams. Considering the small amount visible and the light dressing, I estimate the weight of the salade verte avec sauce as approximately 15 grams."

The target food is mayonnaise, which is spread on the left slice of pain bis (brown bread). The spread covers nearly the entire surface of the slice, with a relatively thin, even layer typical for sandwich spreads. Considering the size of the bread slice is roughly the size of a hand palm (approx. 12 cm long and 7 cm wide), the surface area for mayonnaise is around 84 cm². A typical spread thickness for mayonnaise in sandwiches ranges from 2 to 3 millimeters, which corresponds to a volume of approximately 16 to 25 ml. Knowing mayonnaise has a density close to 0.9 g/ml, the weight is roughly between 14 and 23 grams. Given the spread is not excessively thick but well covered, I estimate the mayonnaise weight at the mid to lower end of this range, around 18 grams."

The target food item is 'pain' which is a slice of bread visible on the plate. The slice is large, covering roughly half of the plate's surface area. The bread appears to be a rustic or whole grain style, which tends to be denser than white bread. Thickness is approximately 1.5 cm based on the visible edge. Considering standard Swiss portion sizes, a typical slice of such bread weighs between 40 and 60 grams depending on thickness and density. This slice is medium-thick and dense, so a reasonable estimate is around the middle to upper range of that. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the bread slice to be approximately 55 grams."

The image shows a single chocolate croissant ('croissant au chocolat') held in one hand, providing a good size reference. The croissant is about the length of the palm (approximately 12-14 cm) and appears fairly thick and dense with visible layers and chocolate inside, as indicated by the bite taken. The croissant is topped with small nut pieces, which add slight weight but are minimal. Considering the typical weight range for chocolate croissants in Switzerland and the visible size and density, this croissant resembles a medium-sized pastry. French/Swiss chocolate croissants typically weigh between 70 and 110 grams, with smaller, bakery-fresh versions closer to 80 grams. Given the visible thickness, partial bite, and toppings, I estimate the weight at around 85 grams."

The image shows a plate with a mixed salad containing rice, cherry tomatoes, peach, corn, asparagus, tuna, red kidney beans, egg, and salad dressing. The target food item is 'oeuf' (egg), which is visible as a half boiled egg sliced in half on the right side of the plate. The half egg appears to be a standard small to medium size, typical for European eggs, with the yolk partially cooked. Given the standard weight of a whole medium egg is around 50 grams, and only half the egg is present here, the estimated weight would be close to half that amount. The egg white and yolk are visibly dense and intact. No visible extra parts are on the plate. Therefore, estimating the weight of the visible half egg, I conclude it to be approximately 25 grams."

The target food item is 'mayonnaise thomy.' In the image, mayonnaise is visible as a small dollop on a plate alongside white asparagus. The dollop appears to be about the size of a tablespoon, with a smooth, thick texture typical of mayonnaise. Using the plate as a size reference, this portion looks like a standard single serving of mayonnaise typically served as a condiment—generally estimated around 15-20 grams. Given the compact, dense nature of mayonnaise, this quantity is reasonable for a small dipping portion. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the mayonnaise thomy portion to be approximately 18 grams."

The target food item is 'cottage cheese aux herbes', which appears as a small pile of white, slightly grainy curds with visible herb flecks on the plate near the sunny side up egg and hummus. For visual scale, the plate is about a medium-sized plate, and the spoon and fork provide additional reference. Cottage cheese typically has a density similar to curds, somewhat light but moist. The portion shown is modest, appearing roughly 2 heaping tablespoons in volume, which is common for a side serving of this cheese. Given a tablespoon of cottage cheese weighs approximately 15-20 grams, this portion likely weighs in the middle to upper range given its volume. Considering the Swiss portion norms and this visual evidence, the serving weight is estimated at around 40 grams."

The target food is 'vinaigre balsamique,' which appears as the dark brown liquid drizzled over the salad ingredients inside the white bowl. Step 1: Visually, the vinaigre balsamique covers the salad surface with some pooling along the top edges. Step 2: The bowl is small and about one-third filled with salad. The vinaigre balsamique is a thin liquid and likely only a light coating on the visible salad, with no significant depth or pooling beyond the surface. Step 3: Given the liquid density close to water (about 1g/mL) and the modest amount visible, I estimate the vinaigre balsamique volume to be roughly 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL). Step 4: Considering typical Swiss portion sizes and visual spread, closer to 15 mL is reasonable. This corresponds to about 15 grams, given liquid density and no container included. Therefore, the estimated weight of the vinaigre balsamique is approximately 15 grams."

The target food item is 'graines de chia' (chia seeds). Visually, the chia seeds are mixed and dispersed throughout a creamy white mixture in the bowl. The chia seeds are small, black and dot the mixture evenly, suggesting a moderate amount incorporated rather than a large pile. Given the size of the bowl (standard small cereal bowl), and typical proportion of chia seeds in such a mixture, the chia seeds likely constitute a relatively small portion by weight. Based on typical serving sizes and visual density, the amount of chia seeds present appears to be around 10 grams, as this is a common portion size added to yogurts or batters for nutritional purposes and fits with the visual dispersion and quantity visible."

The target food item is 'muesli nature,' which is clearly visible on top of the yogurt inside a transparent bowl. The muesli appears as dry flakes and small clusters spread over about 60-70% of the bowl's surface area. The bowl is of medium size, likely around 12 cm in diameter judging by the typical kitchen counter pattern and the thickness of the bowl walls. The depth of the muesli layer looks thin, approximately 1 to 1.5 cm thick, with no visible clumping or submerged parts, indicating it is dry and loosely packed. Muesli density is moderate but can be estimated roughly around 0.4 to 0.5 g/cm3 when loosely packed. Estimating the volume occupied: surface area approx 100 cm2 (circle with 12 cm diameter) × 1.2 cm depth = 120 cm3. Using an average density of 0.45 g/cm3, weight estimate = 120 × 0.45 = 54 grams.

The image shows a metal container with distinct portions of food: grilled aubergine, pork with white sauce on top, and a mound of polenta topped with shredded cheese. The polenta portion occupies roughly one-third of the container's volume and appears dense and moist, with a smooth texture partially covered by a generous amount of grated cheese. The container is a typical small metal meal box, about the size of a lunchbox compartment, giving reference to the polenta's size which seems approximately 10 cm in length, about 6-7 cm in width, and about 3-4 cm in height. The volume is thus significant but not huge. Polenta is dense but lighter than pure meat, and the added cheese increases the total weight slightly, but since cheese is counted outside the polenta itself, we exclude that. Considering typical polenta density of approximately 0.9 to 1.0 g/cm3, and the estimated volume of roughly 200 to 250 cm3, the weight of this portion of polenta is estimated between 180 and 230 grams. Given that the portion looks moderately sized but sufficiently dense, the most reasonable estimate is around 210 grams."

The image shows a single slice of tarte aux fraises on a standard small dessert plate, providing a clear size reference. The slice is approximately 1/8th of a whole tart based on shape and visible crust size. There are about 6 large strawberry halves on top, each approximately 15-20 grams given their volume and density. The creamy custard layer beneath appears thick and dense, roughly 2-3 cm in height and covering the base. The tart crust looks thin but crumbly, typical for such a pastry. The strawberries alone likely account for about 90-110 grams, considering their density and size. Adding the custard (dense, creamy) and the crust (baked pastry), the total weight of the slice likely falls between 150-180 grams. Considering a medium-sized portion for a Swiss context and accounting for the thickness and density of each component, I estimate the total weight of the tarte aux fraises slice at approximately 165 grams."

The target food item is 'oeuf au plat' (fried egg). Visually, the fried egg covers roughly the size of a small to medium dinner plate section; it appears to be a single, standard fried egg cooked with the yolk intact. The egg white has spread out fairly thinly, but the overall volume corresponds to one large egg. Standard large eggs in Europe typically weigh about 50 grams in total. Cooking causes some water loss but does not significantly reduce the overall weight. Given the visual cues of thickness and size relative to the plate, the egg likely weighs close to a typical large egg weight. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'oeuf au plat' to be approximately 50 grams."

The target food item is the 'sauce' visible on the plate. The sauce is spread around and partially covering the mashed potatoes, meat ragout, and carrots. Visually, it appears as a thin layer of brown liquid with a glossy texture pooling on the plate. Given the plate size and the visible amount of sauce, it seems to cover about half of the plate surface with a thin spread around the other foods. The depth of the sauce appears shallow, roughly 2-3 mm thick on average. Considering a typical density similar to water (slightly denser due to ingredients), and the surface it covers, the total volume of sauce is around 50-70 ml. Therefore, converting to weight in grams, the sauce likely weighs approximately 60 grams."

The image shows a white plate with four distinct food items: salade (lettuce), brocolis (broccoli), mais (corn), and pois chiches (chickpeas). The mais is located at the lower center portion of the plate, consisting of loose yellow corn kernels. Visually, the corn portion occupies a relatively small area, roughly equivalent to a small handful or about 1/8th of the plate's surface. The kernels appear loosely piled, about 2-3 cm thick. Comparing to the standard Swiss portion sizes and the plate size, the corn amount looks like a small to medium side portion. Corn kernels have moderate density, around 0.7 grams per cubic centimeter. Given the visual area, estimated thickness, and density, this portion of corn corresponds roughly to 50 to 70 grams. Considering visual evidence, I estimate the corn portion weighs approximately 60 grams."

Both slices are placed flat and fully visible, with no overlap. The toast looks dry and crisp, indicating a typical toasted bread density. A single slice of standard whole grain toast usually weighs around 25-30 grams considering its size and compaction. Since the target food item is 'toast' and there are two full slices visible, the combined weight would approximately be double that of one slice. Therefore, the total weight estimate for the toast is about 50-60 grams. Choosing a middle value, I estimate the weight as 55 grams."
