The image shows a pizza with toppings of mushrooms (champignons), olives, and zucchini (courgettes). The pizza is partially eaten, with five slices visible, and the toppings are distributed across the slices. Based on the size of the slices and the visible toppings, the pizza appears to be a medium-sized pizza. A typical medium pizza weighs around 400-500 grams, including the crust, cheese, and toppings. Since this pizza is not whole, I estimate that about 60% of the pizza remains. Therefore, the weight of the remaining pizza is approximately 240-300 grams.

The specified food item is 'graines de chia' (chia seeds). In the image, the chia seeds are mixed into the blanc battu (a yogurt-like base) and are visible as small black specks distributed throughout the mixture. Chia seeds are very lightweight and expand slightly when mixed with liquid, but their density remains relatively high. Based on the distribution and the size of the bowl, it appears that approximately 1-2 tablespoons of chia seeds were used. A tablespoon of chia seeds weighs about 12 grams. Given the visible spread and density, I estimate the total weight of the chia seeds in this dish to be approximately 15 grams."

The image shows a jar containing a mixture of ingredients, including visible chia seeds distributed throughout the yogurt-based mixture. Chia seeds are small and dense, and their weight can be estimated based on their distribution in the jar. Given the size of the jar and the density of chia seeds in the mixture, it appears that approximately 10-15 grams of chia seeds have been used. This estimation accounts for the fact that chia seeds expand when soaked, but their weight remains relatively low compared to their volume."

The image shows a single slice of tarte à la rhubarbe on a standard-sized plate, with a fork and knife for scale. The slice appears to be a triangular portion of a full tart, with a thin crust and a visible layer of rhubarb pieces on top. Based on the size of the slice relative to the utensils, it is likely about one-eighth of a standard tart. A typical full tart weighs approximately 800-1000 grams, so one slice would weigh around 100-125 grams. Considering the visible density of the rhubarb and the thinness of the crust, I estimate the weight of this slice to be 110 grams."
