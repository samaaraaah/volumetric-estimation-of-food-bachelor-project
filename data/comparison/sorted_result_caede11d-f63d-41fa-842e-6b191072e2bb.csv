wrah5h,pâtes,148.0,440.0,292.0,5.128278153554052,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/115dbd14-27ca-4200-a232-fa9f3eb9bad7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'pâtes' which corresponds to the cooked spiral pasta on the right side of the metal tray. Visually, the pasta portion occupies roughly half of the right side of the container's bottom surface and has some thickness—about 2-3 cm deep as can be inferred from the side walls of the tray and the height of the pile relative to the green beans and chicken pieces. The pasta has tomato sauce mixed in, which slightly increases density but not drastically. Cooked pasta density is fairly high, about 130-150 g per 100 ml. The tray appears to be a standard meal tray about 22 cm long and 14 cm wide. Estimating pasta volume: the pasta occupies approximately 14 cm by 10 cm by 2.5 cm = 350 cm³. Using an average cooked pasta density close to 1.3 g/cm³ (130 g per 100 ml), weight estimated is 350 x 1.3 = 455 g max. Given visible gaps, and that not all the volume is fully occupied by dense pasta (some sauce and air spaces), a reasonable weight range is 400-480 g. Selecting a midpoint accounting for density variation and visual gaps around pasta, a final weight of about 440 g is plausible. This is neither too large nor too small for the volume observed in a Swiss meal container. Therefore, 440 g is a precise estimate for the pasta weight present."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,190.0,227.0,11.232823068707726,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'salade de tomates,' which consists mainly of the visible tomato slices on the plate. The plate is a standard dinner plate about 25 cm diameter, providing scale. The tomato slices are fairly thick and cover most of the plate surface, arranged in a single layer with some overlapping. The tomatoes appear fresh and juicy, consistent with density around 0.9 g/cm³ typical for tomatoes. Taking into account visual volume — the slices measure roughly 15 cm in diameter in total area, with an average thickness of about 1.5 cm. Calculating an estimated volume: area of half the plate ≈ 140 cm² × 1.5 cm thick = approximately 210 cm³. Multiplying by the tomato density (around 0.9 g/cm³), the weight approximates 190 grams. There is some balsamic dressing and olive oil visible, but the tomatoes are the largest volume component. The dressing and seeds weigh far less by comparison and are not included in this tomato salad weight estimate per instructions. A plausible range is 170-210 grams; midpoint estimation around 190 grams is appropriate. This is consistent with portion size and visual appearance without overestimating the thickness or density. The tomato slices are not piled deeply, so no need to increase volume further."
xjvrtk,tomates cerises,500.0,330.0,170.0,10.086626320161386,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/5ccbcf64-3631-48df-9e8a-85fb33dbf912,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'tomates cerises' (cherry tomatoes). In the image, there is a small cardboard container filled with cherry tomatoes on the vine. The tomatoes are round, small, and of typical cherry tomato size (approximately 2.5-3 cm in diameter). There are about 19 tomatoes visible. Cherry tomatoes typically weigh between 15-20 grams each, depending on size and ripeness. The tomatoes in the image look average in size, not overly large or small, and mostly firm. Given the total count of around 19 tomatoes, the total weight likely ranges from 19 x 15g = 285g to 19 x 20g = 380g. To be cautious, we consider a slightly wider range of 280g to 380g. This is consistent with the volume seen in the container and the relative size measured against the book and cloth texture around it. Therefore, the estimated weight near the midpoint would be approximately 330 grams."
8japfq,"pizza champignons, olives, courgettes",183.0,350.0,167.0,3.626557493770025,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/9ac9736b-e0d1-4862-9981-1f47f8109d18,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The food to estimate is a 'pizza champignons, olives, courgettes' consisting of 4 slices on a large plate. The pizza is thin-crust style with visible toppings of mushrooms, olives, and courgettes. The diameter of the pizza appears typical, likely about 25-27 cm. The crust is thin and moderately puffed but not heavy. Each slice is substantial but not thick or deep. Mushrooms and courgettes are low-density vegetables, but olives are denser and fatty. The thickness of the pizza and toppings looks to be about 1-1.5 cm. Given the visible size and ingredient density, each slice likely weighs about 80-95 grams. Since 4 slices remain, the visible portion weighs approximately 320-380 grams. Midpoint here would be about 350 grams total for the 4 slices present. This is plausible since a whole thin crust vegetable pizza of this diameter usually weighs between 400-500 grams. Thus, 350 grams accounts for the partial consumption already visible by missing one slice. I have avoided overestimation by closely observing the thin crust and moderate topping coverage. Therefore, the estimated weight for the pizza as presented is 350 grams."
2ahgvr,salade grecque,315.0,150.0,165.0,6.167675329298683,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/c476a6d0-acb2-45fd-b168-84822bc98003,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The container is a rectangular plastic box that appears to be about 10-12 cm wide and about 6-7 cm deep based on the visible texture and surroundings such as the table and nearby objects. The container is filled roughly to about one-third to half of its height with the salade grecque. The salad contains diced vegetables and feta cheese, typical of a Greek salad. The density of diced vegetables and cheese mixed with salad dressing is moderate; vegetables are low density but cheese and dressing add weight. Considering the visible fill level and volume, the salad portion in this container likely ranges between 120 grams (if lightly packed) and 180 grams (if more compact). Given the salad is not tightly packed but adequately fills the container, a midpoint estimate of about 150 grams is reasonable and plausible based on the visible portion. This avoids overestimation despite the somewhat translucent container, and matches typical homemade salad portion sizes in Switzerland for this container size."
xjvrtk,myrtilles,200.0,70.0,130.0,3.085320992049365,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/4d153e2f-e2dc-478b-80de-472793d5b51e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The food item to estimate is 'myrtilles' (blueberries) shown in a small bowl held in one hand. The bowl is fairly small, about the size of a standard small fruit or dessert bowl, and it appears nearly full. Blueberries are dense but small, average weight per blueberry is about 1-1.5 grams. Judging by the size of the hand compared to the bowl and the blueberries, I estimate there are approximately 50-60 blueberries in the bowl. Considering some variation in size, and that the bowl is roughly full, the weight range would be approximately 50-90 grams. The midpoint of this range is about 70 grams, which seems plausible given the volume and typical density of blueberries. Therefore, the estimated weight of the blueberries in the bowl is 70 grams."
wrah5h,tiramisu,72.0,190.0,118.0,1.008187967248131,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/7b0475df-5b02-4072-abb9-ef75acf0f031,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is tiramisu. In the image, the tiramisu is the creamy layered dessert with a dusting of cocoa powder on top, located on the left side of the dark round plate. The piece of tiramisu appears to be a typical slice approximately 10 cm long, about 4-5 cm wide, and around 4 cm thick. The layers of mascarpone cream and soaked sponge cake indicate a fairly dense dessert, but lighter than a dense cake due to the cream content and the moisture of the sponge. By visually comparing the tiramisu to the plate and the adjacent dessert portion, the slice is about average size for a single dessert serving in Switzerland. The denser density of cream and soaked cake suggests a weight slightly above the volume-for-water baseline, roughly 1.1 g/ml. Estimating the volume at roughly 10 cm x 4.5 cm x 4 cm = 180 cm3, and adjusting for density, the weight is approximately 180 to 200 grams. The lower bound is around 170 g (if lighter due to the airiness of cream) and the upper bound around 210 g if cream is denser or soaked sponge is heavy. Hence a midpoint of about 190 grams is reasonable and visually consistent with what is on the plate."
wrah5h,"légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)",198.0,90.0,108.0,2.537557849768601,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/5e117510-fc82-4a06-a502-12983d55aac5,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)'. On the plate, the sautéed vegetables are the portion on the right side, consisting of visible sliced carrots and chopped leeks, cooked and likely softened. They have some moisture but not overly dense. The volume of vegetables on the plate is approximately the size of a small fist or roughly a half-cup to three-quarters-cup serving. Carrots and leeks when cooked have a medium density, less dense than meat or rice but more than leafy greens. Considering their cooked, softened state, the weight should be roughly between 70 grams (minimum, if the portion is light) and 110 grams (maximum, if the vegetables are packed). The portion is neither very small nor spread thinly, so the likely average weight is near the midpoint of around 90 grams. Given this precise visual observation and accounting for moisture, volume, and density, 90 grams is a reliable estimate for the sautéed vegetables on this plate."
ppf8hc,poulet,98.0,200.0,102.0,1.186187255250979,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/9c8fc2f7-062d-4701-885c-184a8d501c5b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'poulet' (chicken). The chicken piece is located in the lower center of the plate, appearing as a boneless, cooked breast with some juice or sauce underneath. Using the plate as a reference, which seems like a typical dinner plate of around 25-27 cm diameter, the chicken breast is about 12 cm long and 6-7 cm wide, with an estimated thickness of about 2-3 cm. Chicken breast meat is dense, approximately 1.0 to 1.1 g/ml by volume. Based on visual volume (length × width × thickness), the chicken piece volume can be approximated as 12 cm × 6.5 cm × 2.5 cm = roughly 195 cm³. Considering density close to 1 g/cm³, this suggests a weight near 190-210 grams. Given some moisture loss from cooking, the actual weight might be slightly less but still close. Therefore, a plausible weight range is 180 to 220 grams. The mid-point estimate near 200 grams is reasonable and aligns with typical Swiss portions and the visual size seen here. This estimate excludes bones as no bone is visible, and it excludes sauce weight. A quick plausibility check: the chicken breast is moderately thick but not overly large, so 200 grams fits well. Hence, the best estimate is 200 grams."

The specified food item is 'raviolis a la courge,' which are located on the upper part of the plate and appear as 7 medium-sized ravioli pieces. The raviolis are spread out on a flat plate, with some visible herbs or pepper sprinkled on top. Using the plate's overall size as a reference, these raviolis are approximately 4-5 cm each in width. Cooked pasta filled with squash (courge) is moderately dense due to the filling, which adds some weight. Each ravioli likely weighs between 30 to 40 grams considering typical Swiss-sized portions and the thickness visible. Therefore, for 7 raviolis, a plausible total weight range is 210 to 280 grams. I will select a final estimate near the midpoint, around 245 grams. This estimation matches the volume and density visible and seems reasonable given the context on the plate and the other food items nearby."

The specified food item is ""riz complet"" (whole grain brown rice), visible on the plate as a moderately sized pile on the left side. The rice appears cooked, with individual grains visible, indicating moisture content that increases weight compared to dry rice. The portion size relative to the plate (standard dinner plate about 25-28 cm diameter) looks like roughly a mound of about 10 cm by 7 cm surface area and approximately 2-3 cm thick. Cooked brown rice density is fairly compact, typically about 0.95 g/ml. The volume estimation for this mound is approximately 10 cm x 7 cm x 2.5 cm = 175 cm³ (ml). Multiplying by density (0.95 g/ml) gives roughly 166 grams. Considering slight irregularities and some air gaps, a plausible range is 150 to 180 grams. The midpoint, approximately 165 grams, is a reasonable precise estimate. No other container or substances interfere with the rice volume. This estimate fits visually with typical Swiss portions of cooked brown rice served at meals. Therefore, the final estimate is 165 grams."

The specified food is ""salade de pâtes,"" a pasta salad. Visually, the pasta salad portion left on the plate is quite small, scattered with penne pasta, some corn kernels, cherry tomato pieces, and small bits of other ingredients, possibly herbs or small vegetables. The pasta pieces are cooked and look moist, which means their density is relatively high. The total visible volume is low, roughly corresponding to a small handful of pasta pieces spread out on a medium-sized plate. Considering density, cooked pasta weighs about 130-150g per cup (about 200-250 ml), but here the visible volume is closer to roughly one quarter cup or less. The range of weight is likely between 20g minimum and 40g maximum, given the sparse quantity left. As such, a midpoint estimate would be around 30g. This value is reasonable given the size of the plate, the number of pasta pieces, and associated ingredients. It is neither too high (which would require a fuller portion) nor too low for the visible small remnants."

The specified food item is 'spaghetti'. Visually, the spaghetti is served on a medium-sized round plate, covering most of the surface. The spaghetti is somewhat piled but not overly dense or heaped high. Comparing to the visible size of the plate and the relative thickness of the spaghetti strands, the portion appears to be a typical homemade single-serving amount. Given the presence of pesto and grated gruyère cheese scattered on top and around, the spaghetti itself is clearly visible and not mixed, so we can estimate its weight without including the toppings. Spaghetti cooked weight densities are moderate due to water absorption, and the volume here roughly corresponds to about 1 to 1.5 cooked servings. Based on the plate size and visual volume, a reasonable range would be approximately 110 grams (small serving) to 160 grams (full single serving). Taking the midpoint for accuracy and plausibility, I estimate the spaghetti weighs about 135 grams. This is coherent with observed portion sizes and thickness without overestimating the depth or density."

The specified food item is 'pillons de poulet' (chicken drumettes). Visually, there are five chicken drumettes on the plate. Each drumette appears to be grilled and moderately sized, typical portion size for a chicken drumette in Switzerland. Using the plate and pieces of bread as size references, each drumette is about the size of a small chicken wing, and chicken drumettes typically weigh between 30-50 grams depending on size. Given the visual size and density of grilled chicken meat, and seeing that all five are similar size, the total weight for all five drumettes is likely between approximately 150 grams (5 x 30g) and 250 grams (5 x 50g). Considering the chicken is cooked, some water weight is lost, so the drumettes appear a bit compact but dense. Balancing this, a reasonable mid-point estimation is around 190 grams. This estimate is consistent with the visual volume and expected density of the grilled drumettes without over or underestimating based on the plate and bread seen. Thus, final estimate is 190 grams for the total 'pillons de poulet' portion on the plate."

The specified food item is 'poivron' (bell pepper) which appears in the image as sliced strips red in color on the white plate. The portions of poivron are about a small pile occupying roughly 1/4 of the plate length with moderate thickness visible. The poivron pieces are cut into thin strips, indicating lower density relative to whole pieces. Compared to the nearby chunks of chicken and slices of avocado, the poivron volume appears moderate but lighter in density, typical for cooked peppers. Considering a typical cooked bell pepper density close to 0.9 g/ml, and a visible volume approximately equivalent to 100-150 ml (based on the plate size and proportion relative to other items), the weight range would be about 90 to 135 grams. A mid-point estimate around 110 grams fits the visual appearance. This estimation aligns with the size and thickness cues and relative food comparison on the plate, and does not overestimate the portion."

The specified food item is ""colrave crue"", which translates to raw kohlrabi. The image shows peeled and sliced pieces of raw kohlrabi placed evenly on a flat rectangular plastic lid, likely from a takeout container. The size of the slices ranges from medium to large, with most pieces about the size of a small slice of apple, approximately 4-6 cm in length and 2-3 cm wide, and relatively thin slices, about 0.5-1 cm thick. Kohlrabi has a fairly dense, watery texture but is lighter than root vegetables like potatoes. The volume of the kohlrabi pieces on the lid appears to be moderate, spreading across the plate without stacking deeply. Considering the density of raw kohlrabi (~0.6-0.7 g/ml), and the visible volume, I estimate between approximately 150g to 220g. The midpoint around 185g seems reasonable given the quantity and appearance without overestimating thickness or density. The portions do not appear too small or overly large for a snack or light side portion. Therefore, the best estimate for the weight of the raw kohlrabi shown in the image is 185 grams."

The asparagus (asperges) on the plate are green and appear to be steamed or lightly cooked, arranged in a small pile. There are about 8 spears visible, with a length approximately 13-15 cm each. Given the relative size to the potatoes and ham slices, these asparagus are typical slender spear thickness. The spears are not piled deeply, so the volume is fairly shallow. Fresh asparagus weighs about 20 grams per spear on average for medium thickness. Since these look slightly thinner than average and cooked (which reduces water content slightly), I estimate roughly 15-20 grams per spear. Multiplying for 8 spears gives a total weight range of 120-160 grams. Considering the asparagus are cooked and may have slight shrinkage, I lean to the mid value of about 140 grams for the total asparagus portion on this plate. The portion size and visual volume fit well with this estimation and is plausible for the amount served in Switzerland. The other foods do not interfere with the estimation; the asparagus are clearly visible and distinct."

The specified food item is 'pomme' (apple). The image shows a single red apple placed on a flat surface with no container. Comparing the apple size to typical apples and considering the texture and shape, it appears to be a small to medium-sized apple. A typical medium apple weighs around 150-200 grams. This apple looks slightly small to medium-sized and not overly large. The estimated weight range is roughly 130-180 grams. Choosing a midpoint value within this range for accuracy, I estimate about 155 grams. This fits the visual size and typical density of a fresh apple without any unusual characteristics indicating a different weight."

The specified food item is 'courgette et oignons', which is the left half of the container. The container is a square glass box approximately 14 cm wide, and the courgette and onions fill about half the container in area. The vegetables are chopped into medium-sized pieces and appear lightly cooked but not densely packed, typical for sautéed vegetables. Judging by the size and volume seen, the mixture likely has a density slightly less than water due to air gaps between the vegetable pieces. A rough volume estimate would be around 350-400 ml for this section, given the visible thickness of about 3-4 cm. Accounting for the mix of courgette and onions, which have high water content but some density, the weight would reasonably be in the 210-270 gram range. The midpoint of this range is approximately 240 grams. This seems plausible given the physical size and texture visible, and not overly large or small. Therefore, the estimated weight for the courgette et oignons is 240 grams."

The waffle appears crisp and baked, indicating it is typical density. Waffles generally weigh between 100-120 grams for this size and thickness. There is no indication that the waffle is unusually thick or thin. The compote pomme (apple sauce) spread on top is not included in the weight estimate for the waffle. The plate and other decorations help with scale but do not affect the weight estimate. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes, the waffle likely weighs around 105 grams (range approximated between 95-115 grams). I choose 105 grams as a precise, plausible estimate right near the midpoint of the range."

The specified food item is the salad consisting of green leaves, carrots, avocado, olive oil, and vinegar. Visually, the salad fills roughly one-third of a standard dinner plate. The salad includes visible leafy greens, sliced or shredded carrots, and chunks of avocado. The texture and volume of the avocado pieces suggest moderate density, while the greens and carrots are lighter in density. Given the visible volume and components, the salad likely weighs more than just leafy greens but less than a densely packed vegetable dish. Considering Swiss portion sizes and the partial visible avocado pieces, the approximate weight range could be from 80 grams (minimum, for a light salad) up to about 130 grams (maximum, with avocado chunks adding density). The midpoint and reasonable estimate is around 105 grams. This is consistent with the visible volume covered on the plate and the density of avocado and other vegetable components. I have excluded the olive oil and vinegar weight as they are in small quantities and mostly absorbed by the salad, but they are part of the salad item overall. The salad is fully visible on the plate and not mixed into other items, making the estimate less uncertain."

The specified food item is 'légumes (courgette, oignon, 1 cs d'huile d'olive)'. The vegetables are visible on the left side of the plate and consist mainly of sliced zucchini and onions cooked with a small amount of olive oil. The portion covers roughly a quarter of the plate surface area. Considering the plate size is a standard dinner plate (~26-28 cm diameter), the visible pile of cooked vegetables appears about 2-3 cm thick on average. Cooked courgettes and onions have relatively low density due to water content, but the sautéing likely makes them slightly denser than raw. Typical density for cooked veggies is about 0.6-0.8 g/ml. The volume of the vegetables roughly estimated is around 150-200 ml (given the area and thickness). Multiplying by density suggests a plausible weight range between 90 grams (150 ml * 0.6 g/ml) and 160 grams (200 ml * 0.8 g/ml). Given these observations, the oregano oil spread thin onto the vegetables and the slight air pockets inside the vegetable mass, the weight near the middle of this range around 120-130 grams seems realistic. Rechecking for over- or underestimation: the portion is consistent with an individual side serving of sautéed vegetables in a Swiss meal, and visually it doesn't appear overly thick or thin. Therefore, the final estimate is 125 grams for the 'légumes (courgette, oignon, 1 cs d'huile d'olive)'."

The specified food item is 'pain bis,' which is a type of whole grain or rye bread. In the image, two slices of pain bis are visible. One slice is spread with mayonnaise, and the other has cheese strips and two cornichons. The size of each slice is roughly the length of a hand, about 12-14 cm long and 7-8 cm wide, with a medium thickness typical for sliced bread, about 1.5 cm. Considering the density of pain bis, which is denser than white bread but still porous, and the thickness of these slices, a single slice would weigh approximately 40-50 grams. Since the image shows two slices, the total weight for both slices of bread (pain bis) would reasonably be in the range of 80-100 grams. Choosing a value near the midpoint gives us 90 grams. This estimate is plausible because a single slice often weighs around 40-50 grams in Swiss bread standards, and the portion observed matches typical sandwich bread size and thickness without any unusual compactness or fluffiness."

The specified food item is 'croissants au jambon,' which are two small ham croissants on the plate. Visually, each croissant is small, roughly the size of a little finger, typical of mini savory croissants filled with ham. Given their puff pastry nature, they are relatively light but have some density due to the dough and ham filling. Comparing their size to the baguette slices and the fork nearby helps estimate volume. Each croissant approximately weighs between 40-50 grams based on its size and filling. With two croissants present, the total weight would be about 80-100 grams. Choosing a midpoint of this range for accuracy results in roughly 90 grams. This seems plausible considering the visible dimensions and filling."

The food item specified is 'myrtilles' (blueberries). The blueberries are mixed within a bowl containing 'mélange de céréales' and 'yogourt orange sanguine'. Visually assessing the bowl, it is about the size of a standard cereal bowl, roughly 15 cm in diameter. The mixture fills about 80% of the bowl volume. The myrtilles appear scattered rather than densely packed, constituting roughly 10-15% of the total mixture volume. Blueberries are relatively light but not extremely low in density—each blueberry weighs about 1-2 grams. There appear to be approximately 20-25 visible blueberries and some slightly hidden among the cereal and yogurt. Estimating total blueberries scattered through the portion: between 25 and 35 pieces. Multiplying the count by average blueberry weight (about 1.5 g per berry), the weight range for blueberries (myrtilles) is roughly 38-52 grams. This is consistent with the visible volume of dispersed blueberries in the bowl. Hence, the midpoint estimate of around 45 grams is reasonable and fits well with the visual and density cues."

The specified food is 'pain' (bread). The image shows two slices of roughly rustic or country bread, toasted, placed on a standard-sized plate. Each slice appears dense with some air pockets typical for this type of bread. Each slice is about 1-1.5 cm thick, with a medium size about 10 cm long and 6-7 cm wide. Given the visible thickness and typical density of country bread, the weight of each slice is roughly in the range of 30-45 grams. Since both slices together appear on the plate, the combined weight of visible bread (pain) is roughly between 60-90 grams. Choosing near the midpoint while favoring the slightly thick appearence and density, a good estimate is about 75 grams total for the bread shown."

The food item is 'poire' (pear), which is clearly visible in the image as several cut pieces in a plastic container. The container has visible volume markings showing approximately 0.5 liters capacity, and the pear pieces occupy a bit less than half of the container's volume. Pear is a dense fruit with a density close to water, slightly less than 1 g/ml but close enough for estimation. Judging by the size of the pieces, each piece appears to be roughly a quarter to a third of a medium-sized pear. The total pieces combined visually correspond to about 1 to 1.5 medium pears. A medium pear typically weighs between 150 and 200 grams. Therefore, the weight range for the visible pear pieces is about 150-300 grams. Considering the container is not fully filled and the pieces are cut somewhat irregularly, a reasonable estimate would be around the midpoint of 225 grams. This fits the visual volume and typical density of pears well without overestimation or underestimation."

The specified food item is ""pomme"" (apple). In the image, the apple appears to be a medium-sized apple, roughly 7-8 cm tall with a typical round shape. The apple's volume can be approximated by comparing its size to the croissant nearby, which is also roughly of average size. A medium apple weighs between 150 and 200 grams on average. Considering the apple's visible size and shape, it is likely closer to the lower-middle part of this range. The surface has typical density for a fresh apple which is mostly water. Thus, an estimated weight in the range of 150 to 180 grams seems reasonable. Choosing a midpoint near 165 grams makes sense after visual and contextual evaluation. This is consistent with expectations for an apple of this size and no visual evidence suggests it is unusually large or small."

The specified food item is 'salade de pâtes'. On the plate, the pasta salad consists of curled pasta mixed with small visible pieces of vegetables like tomato and corn. The portion is placed on a standard sized dinner plate, which typically has a diameter of about 25 cm. The pasta salad takes up roughly a small quadrant of the plate's surface with a moderate height of around 2 cm, considering the pasta shape and the visible volume. Pasta is fairly dense once cooked, so volume correlates well with weight. Estimating from the visible volume (around 7 x 6 x 2 cm = 84 cm³) and knowing that cooked pasta weighs approximately 140 g per 100 ml (due to water absorption and density), the weight is roughly between 110 g and 130 g. The other food items and their arrangement do not overlap or mix with the pasta, so no mass correction is needed. The mid-value of about 120 g is reasonable. The portion size seems typical for a side pasta salad in Switzerland and the visual appearance supports this. Therefore, the best estimate is 120 grams."

The specified food item is ""fraises"" (strawberries). In the image, there are four medium to large strawberries in a small green bowl. Strawberries typically have a density close to water but slightly less due to their air content, approximately 0.6 to 0.8 g/ml. Each strawberry here looks fairly large and dense, with average length around 5-6 cm. A typical large strawberry weighs between 20-30 grams. Since these strawberries look large but also slightly irregular in shape, I estimate each weighs between 20 to 30 grams. With four strawberries, the total weight range is roughly 80 to 120 grams. Considering the visual fullness and size, a midpoint estimate of around 100 grams is reasonable and balanced. This avoids overestimating given the medium bowl size and visible volume of the strawberries."

The specified food item is 'pain' (bread). There are two slices of bread on the plate, both appear to be of rustic, crusty style with some density and thickness typical of European bread. Each slice is roughly 1 cm thick, about 12 cm long and 6 cm wide. Considering the visible volume and typical density of this kind of bread, each slice likely weighs around 40-50 grams. Together, the two slices weigh approximately 80-100 grams. Given this, a midpoint estimate would be around 90 grams. This estimation is consistent with the size and density observed, and the presence of spreads does not affect the bread weight. Partial edges and crumbs do not significantly reduce the weight. Therefore, the estimated weight of the total bread (pain) visible in the image is 90 grams."

The image shows several slices of salami arranged on a plate, next to two radishes and an open sandwich with ham, green onions, and balsamic cream. Each salami slice is thin and has a typical diameter of about 3-4 cm, suggesting a density typical of cured sausage, which is relatively dense. There are around 6 visible slices, with some broken pieces. Each slice visually corresponds to about 8-10 grams of salami. This is based on the approximate size and thickness compared to the known size of radishes (~3-4 cm diameter) and the plate's size. Therefore, total weight would be between 48 and 60 grams. Given this visual volume and density, the midpoint is about 55 grams. This is plausible as a small snack portion of salami, neither too small nor oversized for the amount seen on the plate."

The specified food item is 'salade verte' (green salad). Visually, the salade verte is a small portion of leafy greens located near the bottom center of the plate, slightly to the right. The leaves are dressed lightly with some dressing or sauce, visible by the sheen and coating. The portion size is modest compared to the other items on the plate, such as the meat (rôti) and the mixed salads. The salad leaves are relatively flat and spread out, not piled high, indicating a light volume. Since lettuce and leafy greens have low density, the weight per volume is small. Considering the plate size (typical dinner plate about 25-28 cm diameter) and the proportionate size of the salad, the volume is approximately a handful of leaves, roughly equivalent to 50-70 grams of fresh salad. The range estimate could be 40 to 80 grams given leafy greens' variability and slight dressing. I'll choose a midpoint close to 60 grams as a reasonable estimate for the salade verte on this plate. This estimate excludes any dressing weight separately and only covers the green leaves seen."

Each slice appears to be about 1-2 cm thick, with an approximate length of 8-10 cm and width of 2-3 cm. Considering the typical density and thickness of avocado flesh, the total visible avocado volume corresponds to roughly half of a small to medium avocado. A small to medium avocado typically weighs about 150-200 grams total, with the edible flesh being around 130-170 grams. Since we only see roughly half an avocado portion distributed on the wrap, a plausible weight range for the visible avocado is about 60 to 90 grams. To be precise, and judging the size and depth as shown, the midpoint of this range at about 75 grams is a reasonable and accurate estimate. This fits the visual cues perfectly without overestimating, and is consistent with Swiss portion sizes and avocado slice thickness observed here."

Visually, the meat portion is roughly 10 cm in length and about 5 cm in width, with an average thickness of around 1.5 cm. The meat appears cooked ground or formed meat, dense and compact. Comparing it to the size of the potatoes and salad leaves confirms it is a moderate portion typical of a single serving. Given the dimensions and typical density of cooked ground meat (approximately 1 g/cm³), the volume can be estimated around 10 cm × 5 cm × 1.5 cm = 75 cm³ roughly. Given some irregularities and edges, a range of 70–90 grams is plausible. Checking if this number is reasonable, 75 grams is a moderate portion, neither too small nor oversized for dinner. Therefore, the final estimate is 80 grams, near midpoint of the range."

The eggs are in relatively loose, fluffy curds with visible thickness. The plate seems to be a standard dinner plate around 25 cm in diameter. Comparing the size of the eggs to the gnocchi and cauliflower pieces, the portion of scrambled eggs looks like a moderate serving, typical of a single meal portion. Scrambled eggs are relatively dense, with an average density close to roughly 0.9 g/ml due to the air incorporated, but denser than something like lettuce. Given the volume and appearance, an estimated weight range for this portion lies between 90 and 130 grams. Since it looks like a moderate standard portion rather than a large portion, a sensible estimate near the midpoint would be about 110 grams. This accounts for the fluffiness but also the compactness of the scrambled eggs on the plate."

Each galette is about 5 cm in diameter and relatively thin, around 1.5 cm thick. The container is a typical medium meal prep box, helping to gauge size. The millet and beans provide a moderately dense composition; millet's density with cooked grains is similar to cooked rice (~130-150 g per 100 ml), but the addition of beans makes it denser. Each galette looks like a small compact patty rather than loose grains. Based on visual volume and density, each galette likely weighs between 50-65 grams. Since there are two similar patties, the total weight for both combined is around 100-130 grams. Selecting a midpoint within this range, the total weight of both galettes together comes to approximately 115 grams. This fits well with visual size relative to the container and other foods, and does not seem over- or underestimated."

The specified food item is “blevita,” which is a type of branded crispbread commonly sold in Switzerland. The image shows a stack of four rectangular Blevita crispbreads placed on a wooden surface. Each individual crispbread is thin and lightweight, with visible perforations and the brand name embossed. Typically, a single Blevita crispbread weighs around 12 to 15 grams depending on the variety and thickness. Given there are four crispbreads stacked here and no visible additional thickness or toppings that would add weight, the best estimate is the sum weight of these four pieces. Therefore, the total weight range for four pieces is approximately 48 grams (4 x 12g) to 60 grams (4 x 15g). Considering the visible thickness and density corresponds with a typical Blevita, I choose a midpoint near 54 grams. This estimate aligns logically with the size and number of slices without overestimating the weight."

Visually, the bowl appears to be about 10 cm in diameter and filled close to the top with clumped muesli pieces. The muesli clusters are dense but porous, with visible oats and grains. Given the bowl size and the muesli's loose, chunky texture, the volume is roughly that of a small bowl, which might hold about 150-200 ml. Considering muesli's density is lower than fully cooked or liquid foods, I estimate a density around 0.5 to 0.6 g/ml. This gives a weight range roughly between 75g and 120g. The clusters are loosely packed, so a weight near the middle of this range is realistic. Therefore, an estimate of 95g is reasonable. This is not too large for the portion size, and not too small looking at the volume and clumping visible in the bowl."

The specified food items are galettes millet, haricots noirs, and maïs, which appear to be combined into patties or cakes visible on the right side of the bowl. The galettes are visibly cooked and fairly compact, roughly 5 small round patties. Each galette is about 6-7 cm in diameter and approximately 1-1.5 cm thick. Given their dense appearance with included black beans (haricots noirs) and corn (maïs), the density is moderately high. Considering typical density of cooked pulses and millet combined, the density may be near 1 g/cm³ to slightly less due to some air and vegetable matter. Rough individual galette volume is roughly π*(3 cm)^2*1.2 cm ≈ 34 cm³. Multiplying by about 5 patties gives approximately 170 cm³. Assuming 0.9 to 1.1 g/cm³ density range, the weight range is 150-190 grams. This is consistent with the visual compactness and plate size apparent in the image. Hence, a midpoint estimate of about 170 grams is reasonable for the combined galettes containing millet, black beans, and corn. The tomato and onion salad occupies the other half and does not influence this weight. No evidence suggests extra moisture or dry weight change beyond the observed volume and texture. Therefore, the best estimate for galettes millet, haricots noirs, maïs is 170 grams."

The tomatoes cover about 40% of the container's bottom surface and appear to be about 1-1.5 cm thick slices. Considering tomato density (mostly water, relatively low density), the visible volume of tomato is approximately 60-90 cubic centimeters. Therefore, the plausible weight range of the tomatoes is about 60-90 grams. This estimate is consistent with the visible portion size compared to the mozzarella and millet in the same container. Taking the midpoint of this range, an estimated value of 75 grams is reasonable and plausible for the visible tomato portion."

The portion size covers roughly one third of the plate. The plate is of standard dinner size, approximately 25-27cm in diameter, and the salad's height and volume appear moderate, not piled high. Lettuce is low density and light, so despite covering a significant surface area, the mass remains relatively low. Based on the visual volume and the typical weight of fresh leaf lettuce, plus seeds, an estimated weight range is around 40-70 grams. Midpoint near 55 grams seems appropriate. The salad does not seem overly dense or compacted, so values on the higher side are less likely. Thus, 55 grams is a reasonable estimate for the salad portion present."

Compared to other cheeses on the plate and the size of the baguette slice, this portion appears to be a small cheese wedge. Tomme fleurette is a semi-soft cheese with moderate density, typically less dense than hard cheeses but denser than very soft cheeses. Based on its size, I estimate the volume to be about 30-40 cubic centimeters. Given the density, a reasonable estimate of weight is approximately 0.9 to 1.2 grams per cubic centimeter. Multiplying volume by density yields a weight range roughly between 27 g and 48 g. The visual portion looks closer to 35-40 g given the compactness and thickness. As a plausibility check, this aligns with a typical small cheese serving size on a tasting plate. Hence, a value near the midpoint, around 38 grams, is most accurate."

The plate is a standard dinner plate around 25-27 cm diameter, providing scale. The carrots appear moist and cooked, making them denser than raw, roughly 0.9-1 g/ml in density. The volume visually approximates to about 150-200 ml when viewed in aggregate thickness. This suggests a weight range of roughly 135 to 180 grams for the carrots.

Comparing it to the size of the fork and beans, the portion looks like a standard side serving. Given the plate size and pasta density, the weight likely ranges between 120 and 170 grams. Checking if it seems too small or too large: this is not an unusually large pasta portion and it matches expected visual volume for a main carbohydrate portion in Switzerland. Hence, choosing a midpoint value, I estimate the pasta weight to be approximately 145 grams."

The specified food item is 'yaourt nature'. The yogurt is in a small plastic container typical of single-serving yogurts commonly sold in Switzerland and Europe. Such containers usually have a volume of approximately 125 to 150 milliliters. The yogurt appears to be filled nearly to the top, indicating a nearly full container. Yogurt density is close to that of water but slightly thicker; approximately 1.03 g/ml is a reasonable assumption. Thus, for a 125-150 ml container, the weight range would be roughly between 130 g and 155 g. Since the container looks standard size and the yogurt is full, an estimate near the midpoint, around 140 g, is a precise and reasonable weight. This also passes the plausibility check, considering the visual size compared to the apple and typical portion sizes in Switzerland."

The specified food is 'pain', which is depicted as three slices of bread on a plate. Each slice appears to be a rustic multigrain or seeded bread, roughly 1 to 1.5 cm thick. The slices are of moderate size, about the size that fits a typical small bread loaf, considering the plate size and weave pattern of the placemat for scale. A typical slice of this kind of bread weighs between 30-40 grams. The three slices together would then weigh approximately between 90 grams (3 x 30g) and 120 grams (3 x 40g). Since the slices look moderately thick and reasonably dense, the midpoint of this range is about 105 grams. This estimation seems plausible given the visible volume and density of the bread, and the size relative to the plate and bread crumb texture."

The specified item is 'salade de carotte, mais, tomates.' Visually, this salad appears as a somewhat loosely piled mixture of shredded carrots, yellow corn kernels, halved cherry tomatoes, and some leafy green herbs or spinach on a plate. It covers an area approximately the size of one pizza slice or slightly smaller. Considering the typical density of shredded carrot salad combined with corn and tomatoes—which have lower density than cooked or compact foods—this mixture is moderately dense but not heavy. The pile is about 1-2 cm in depth and spread roughly 10 cm by 7 cm. Comparing to the pizza slices, the volume appears roughly equivalent to half of a standard small salad bowl serving. Given the visible portion size and the components' densities, a plausible weight range is approximately 90 to 140 grams. Selecting a midpoint near 115 grams accounts for vegetable moisture, density variations, and visible volume. The estimate avoids overestimation by carefully considering that the salad is not tightly packed and uses visual reference from pizza slices and plate size."

The pizza slice on the plate appears to be a small leftover portion, roughly a quarter or less of a typical small personal pizza slice. The slice shows a medium-thickness crust and a moderate amount of toppings (visible mushrooms and sauce). The plate is standard-sized (around 24 cm diameter), so the slice covers about 1/6 to 1/7 of the plate diameter in length, consistent with a small piece. Considering the density of cooked pizza with crust, sauce, cheese, and mushrooms, a whole personal pizza typically weighs around 200-300 grams. This piece looks about 1/6 to 1/8 of a full pizza, so I estimate a range roughly between 30 to 50 grams. Taking a midpoint towards the lower side due to some missing parts and exposure, I conclude about 40 grams is the best estimate. This matches the visible size, thickness, and expected density without overestimation."

The specified food is 'tomates'. From the image, there are three tomato wedges visible on the wrap. Each wedge appears to be from a medium-sized tomato, cut into quarters roughly. The tomato pieces are fresh, juicy, and have a moderate thickness, with visible seeds and pulp. Using the plate and nearby items like the wrapped ham slice and shredded cheese for scale, the total visible tomato pieces cover a small section of the wrap but have noticeable thickness. Considering typical density of fresh tomatoes (approximately 0.95 g/ml) and the volume of the three wedges combined (around 40-60 ml), the plausible weight range would be roughly 35-55 grams. The mid-point estimate would be approximately 45 grams. This is a reasonable portion size for a few tomato wedges on a single serving wrap and fits the visual evidence without overestimation."

The specified food item is 'sauce bolognese,' which is the tomato-based meat sauce visible spread over the spaghetti on the plate. The sauce covers roughly the center portion of the plate and sits below the grated cheese. The plate is a standard-large dinner plate, about 25-28 cm in diameter, helping gauge scale. The sauce volume appears moderate, approximately covering an area of 10 cm by 7 cm with a thin depth of roughly 1.5 cm. This gives a rough volume estimate of around 105 ml (10 x 7 x 1.5). Considering the typical density of a meat sauce is about 1.1 to 1.2 g/ml due to meat and vegetables being denser than water, the weight range is approximately 115-125 grams. Also, the sauce looks slightly chunky but not heavy. After cross-checking for plausibility, this range makes sense given the visible quantity on the plate and the relative sizes of other foods. Thus, a midpoint estimate of about 120 grams is reasonable for the 'sauce bolognese.'"

The specified food item is ""demi croissant"" which translates to half of a croissant. The image shows a small piece of croissant on a plate, with visible texture and layers. The size of the piece relative to the plate suggests this is indeed about half a small-to-medium-sized croissant rather than a whole one. Swiss croissants are typically smaller and less bulky than North American ones, and half would weigh less accordingly. Given the visible portion, the croissant piece seems lightly flaky and not very dense. A full standard Swiss croissant weighs roughly between 50 and 70 grams. Half of it, therefore, would range approximately 25 to 35 grams. Because the piece appears intact and not overly compressed, I estimate near the midpoint of this range. The visible portion is consistent with a demi croissant weight approximately 30 grams. This takes into account the typical density and volume of a croissant and the size in the image on the plate with some crumbs around to confirm scale. Hence, a precise estimate is 30 grams."

The specified food item is 'galettes millet haricots noirs maïs', which are visible on the right side of the container. There are four pieces lined up vertically. Each galette is roughly the size of a small cookie, about 5-6 cm in diameter and approximately 1.5-2 cm thick. Considering their composition with millet (a grain), black beans (denser legume), and corn (vegetable kernels), the mixture likely has a moderate density somewhat less than dense meat but more than cooked vegetables. 

Estimating volume: Each galette has roughly a cylinder shape with base diameter ~6 cm and height ~1.7 cm, so volume ≈ π * (3 cm)^2 * 1.7 cm ≈ 48 cm³ per galette. Four galettes total volume ≈ 4 * 48 = 192 cm³.

Density estimate: Millet cooked is about 1 g/cm³, black beans a bit denser, but combined with corn and some possible air pockets in the galette, an average density of about 0.8-1.0 g/cm³ is plausible.

Weight range: 192 cm³ * 0.8 g/cm³ = 154 g minimum, up to 192 g maximum.

Cross-check visually: The galettes occupy about half of the container volume, which fits with about 150-190 g. Nothing suggests they are overly dry or airy enough to reduce weight significantly, nor extremely dense.

Final estimation: Choosing midpoint about 170 g is most reasonable for 4 galettes together.

Therefore, the estimated weight for 'galettes millet haricots noirs maïs' is 170 grams."

The specified food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries). In the image, the blueberries are clearly visible on a small plate next to raspberries and strawberries. There are approximately 12 blueberries, each being about the size of a small marble, approximately 1.5 to 2 cm in diameter. Blueberries have a density close to water but slightly less dense due to air inside. Each blueberry typically weighs about 1 to 1.5 grams. With around 12 blueberries, the total weight estimate would be between 12 grams (if smaller berries) and 18 grams (if larger, denser berries). Given the size observed, the blueberries appear medium-sized. Therefore, estimating near the midpoint of this range, I conclude the total weight of the blueberries on the plate is about 15 grams. This estimate is consistent with the visual size of the plate and the relative scale of the surrounding items, ensuring it is neither too low nor too high."

The specified food item is ""graine de chia"" (chia seeds), which appear visibly mixed into the creamy mixture inside the glass jar. The jar contains a blend of yogourt nature, flocons d'avoine, son d'avoine, miel, graine de chia, and purée d'amande. Chia seeds are tiny and dispersed throughout the mixture. Visually, the seeds are scattered and do not appear in large piles but uniformly distributed. The total mixture looks to fill about 3/4 of a small jar approximately 250 ml in capacity. Since chia seeds absorb liquid and expand, the seeds are swollen, not dry, which reduces their weight per volume compared to dry seeds. A typical yogurt's density is close to 1 g/ml, but chia seeds have a density around 0.7 g/ml when dry. Considering the volume the seeds occupy in the mixture (likely around 2-3 tablespoons worth, judging by the visible black specks evenly distributed), the plausible weight range is 15-25 grams. The middle of this range, weighting roughly a level tablespoon of dry seeds (12-15 g) plus swelling, leads to about 20 grams. This is logically consistent with the visible density and portion inside the jar. It is unlikely to be much less because the seeds clearly show throughout the visible area, and not more since the overall volume is constrained by the jar size and mixture composition."

The specified food item is 'pousses de graines' (sprouts). From the image, the sprouts are located in the center-left part of the bowl, spread lightly over the spinach and below some cherry tomato halves. The container is a square white bowl roughly 20 cm x 20 cm, and the sprouts appear to cover an area of about roughly half the bottom of the bowl but are quite shallow and sparse in layering. Sprouts are very light and low in density. Their volume seems to be around a small handful, roughly 50-70 ml in volume considering the sparse layering. Given their low density and appearance, a plausible weight range would be between about 10 g to 20 g for the visible amount. Estimating more precisely, a midpoint around 15 g fits the visual volume and density combination. This is consistent with Swiss portion sizes and the visible amount in the bowl, without overestimating thickness or spread."

The specified food item is 'sauce vinaigrette,' which appears as a light layer or drizzle mostly on the tofu à la mangue and some vegetables (carrot râpées, quinoa, beetroot). The vinaigrette is likely lightly coating these foods rather than being pooled separately. It seems to be absorbed or minimally present, given the absence of visible liquid pooling in the metal container. Considering Swiss portion expectations and usual vinaigrette usage, a typical amount for a salad portion like this would be around 10-20 grams. The container is a medium-sized metal box (likely about 500-700 ml total volume), and the vinaigrette volume is small compared to the other solid foods. So a weight range of 10 to 20 grams is plausible, with 15 grams a reasonable midpoint estimate for this amount of visible vinaigrette."

The item is a single 'branche de chocolat,' which visually resembles a typical chocolate-coated snack bar with a rough texture, possibly containing nuts or crisped rice inside. The size is roughly comparable to a finger-sized snack bar that is about 10 to 12 cm long and about 2 cm in diameter. Considering the density of chocolate (solid but not very dense compared to pure nuts) and the size, such an item typically weighs between 30 and 50 grams. The thickness suggests some volume but it is not very bulky. Given the visual cues and average chocolate bar portion sizes common in Switzerland, a reasonable weight range for this chocolate branch is 35 to 45 grams. Picking a value near the midpoint, the estimated weight is 40 grams. This aligns well with the size and expected density without overestimating the mass."

The bowl appears to be a standard medium-sized salad bowl, about 20 cm in width. The spinach leaves cover the bowl base and are layered to some extent but not densely packed. Spinach is a low-density leafy green; a large volume corresponds to a relatively low weight due to air space between leaves. Considering the visible volume and typical density of fresh spinach, this portion seems like about 30-50 grams. Lower weights would be too small given the volume on the plate, and higher weights would imply very thick layers or tightly packed leaves, which is not visible here. The midpoint of this range is around 40 grams, which fits the visual assessment well. Therefore, the estimation for the épinards frais weight is 40 grams."

The food item to estimate is ""pain"" (bread). The image shows a single slice of bread partially covered with beurre (butter) and pâte à tartiner (spread). The bread slice appears to be of standard thickness, roughly 1-1.5 cm thick, and about 10 cm wide. It is a portion of a small roll or a slice from a small loaf. Considering typical Swiss bread density and size, a slice like this could weigh between 20 g (minimum estimate for a lighter, airy bread) and up to 35 g (for a denser, slightly thicker slice). The bread is roughly half a round slice, with moderate thickness and not very thick crust, so it is unlikely to be heavier than 35 g. The most reasonable estimate given visible size and average bread density is about 27 g, the midpoint of this range. This accounts for the slice being not very thick but fairly dense, typical of Swiss white bread rolls."

The specified food item is ""pain"", a piece of bread visible in the image. It is a thick slice or broken chunk of rustic bread, about the size of a hand segment or slightly smaller. The bread has noticeable crust on the lower side and a porous, somewhat dense crumb structure. Comparing the slice to the plate and the visible hand in the upper left corner, the bread piece is approximately 10 cm in length, 5-6 cm in width, and about 2-3 cm in thickness. Bread density typically ranges around 0.25 to 0.3 grams per cubic centimeter, given the airy crumb but solid edges. Estimating volume as roughly a cuboid: 10 cm x 6 cm x 2.5 cm = 150 cm³. Multiplying by density: 150 cm³ x 0.27 g/cm³ (average) = approx 40.5 g. Bread can vary slightly, so a reasonable range would be 35-45 grams considering visible porosity and actual size. Therefore, the best estimate near the midpoint is 40 grams. No additional food weight is included, just the bread piece. This estimate aligns with plausible visual size and known bread density characteristics."

The specified food item is 'oeufs' (eggs). Visually, there are two fried eggs on top of a plate full of pasta with ketchup drizzled on them. Each fried egg typically weighs about 50 grams when cooked, including the white and yolk. The eggs here are fully cooked but not overly thick or overly thin, and both are whole fried eggs. Considering the size of the eggs relative to the pasta and the plate dimensions, the portion looks normal and complete. Therefore, the range for two eggs cooked like this lies roughly between 90 grams (if small and thin) to about 110 grams (if large and thick). The midpoint and most reasonable weight for two fried eggs on this plate is 100 grams. This estimate excludes the ketchup or other foods. The eggs appear intact and standard in size, so this is a reliable estimate."

The image shows a white bowl with two distinct piles of seeds or grains. One pile corresponds to flocon d'avoines (oat flakes), which is light beige in color and moderately finely textured. The bowl appears to be a small to medium-sized cereal bowl, and the oat flakes are spread out in a relatively thin layer, occupying roughly half of the bowl's bottom surface. The flakes are quite light and loosely piled, likely with little depth (approximately 0.5 to 1 cm thick). Given the volume and the low density of oat flakes, I estimate the visible portion of flocon d'avoines to weigh between 18 to 28 grams. Selecting a midpoint in this range, a weight of 23 grams seems accurate. The other item in the bowl is darker seeds, presumably flaxseeds, and do not affect this portion's estimation. This is consistent with typical individual servings of oat flakes used for breakfast or muesli preparation. Therefore, the final estimated weight is 23 grams."

The item to estimate is a slice of tarte à la rhubarbe (rhubarb tart). Visually, the slice measures approximately one-sixth to one-eighth of a standard homemade tart, judging by the plate size and the fork and knife beside it, which are typical table utensils around 18-20 cm long. The tart slice is thin, around 2-3 cm thick at most, with a visible baked crust and cooked rhubarb pieces embedded in a custard-like filling. Rhubarb is quite dense and moist, but the tart overall is not heavy due to the flaky crust and custard filling (less dense than pure fruit). A full tart of this size would weigh approximately 600-700 g including crust, filling, and rhubarb pieces. Hence, a slice of about one-sixth to one-eighth would weigh roughly between 75 and 115 grams. Considering the visible density, moisture content, and the fact that the slice is not overly thick but contains a generous amount of rhubarb, a midpoint estimate around 95 grams is reasonable. This fits the visual scale and the utensil size comparison as well as typical tart portion expectations in Switzerland."

The specified food is 'tartine mélasse + beurre'. From the image, the tartine (a slice of rustic bread) is spread with a visible layer of butter and a similar amount of molasses (mélasse). The bread slice is medium sized, approximately 12 cm in length and 5–6 cm wide, with a moderate thickness of about 2 cm. The butter layer appears evenly but thinly spread, and the molasses is spread thinly enough to be mostly transparent over the butter, so not very thick. Bread density for this type of rustic bread is roughly 250–300 g per 100 cm3. The volume of this slice is estimated roughly at (12x6x2 cm = 144 cm3), but given the porous nature of bread, let's assume around 0.28 g/cm3 density for this type of bread (much less than compact bread). So, bread weight is approximately 40 g. Now for the butter: a thin spread over this size could be roughly 5 g. The molasses, being liquid and thinly spread, would be roughly the same or slightly less, approximately 4 g. Adding these up: bread 40 g + butter 5 g + molasses 4 g = 49 g. Considering some visual uncertainty in spread thickness and size, a reasonable range is 45–55 g. Choosing near midpoint, the estimated weight for tartine mélasse + beurre is 49 g."

The image shows a white plate with a volume of chips labeled as 'chips vaya beans.' The chips appear thin, mostly flat triangular pieces with some visible air pockets, suggesting a light and crispy texture. Based on the plate size and typical chip size, the pile roughly covers the bottom of the plate but does not stack very high — approximately 2 to 3 cm in thickness on average at the highest points. The chips are visibly dense but not heavy, being fried or baked bean chips. Comparing with standard thin chips, and considering they are made from beans which may add some density, the range of weight likely falls between 40 grams (minimum, if very thin and sparse) to about 65 grams (maximum, if moderately thick and heaped). The visual gives an impression closer to the middle of this range due to moderate layering and some overlapping chips. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the total weight of the 'chips vaya beans' on the plate is 53 grams."

The tart slice is about the size of a typical dessert portion, estimated to be roughly 10 cm long and 5 cm wide. The height of the slice appears to be around 3 cm when including the crust, filling, and strawberries. The strawberries on top seem fresh and moderately thick, which adds density. The cream layer looks smooth and moderately dense, and the crust is crumbly but solid. Based on Swiss portion sizes and the visible volume, the weight range for such a slice would probably fall between 130 grams at minimum (lighter cream, thinner crust) and 180 grams maximum (thicker cream and more strawberries). Taking the midpoint and considering the visible fullness and density of the cream and strawberries, an estimate of about 155 grams is reasonable. This weight excludes the plate and any crumbs around it but includes all visible components of the tart slice on the plate in the image."

Based on visual comparison to the slice of bread and the strawberries nearby, each raspberry likely weighs around 4-5 grams due to their hollow, delicate structure. Raspberries are fairly light and airy, so the total weight is not very large despite the number. Multiplying by 7 berries gives a weight range roughly between 28 grams (7x4g) and 35 grams (7x5g). Given slight variation in size and density, the midpoint of approximately 31 grams is a balanced estimate. This figure is plausible considering the volume and density visible in the image, with no overestimation. Therefore, the weight estimate for the framboises present is carefully settled at 31 grams."

The specified food item is 'hummous,' which is visible on the plate as a creamy beige spread near the bottom left side. The hummous portion looks like a small dollop rather than a large spread or a full container scoop. Comparing it to the nearby items gives scale: the olives and cherry tomatoes nearby suggest the hummous portion is about 3-4 tablespoons in volume. Hummous density is roughly similar to thick paste, approximately 1 g per ml. Given the visual size — about the volume of a golf ball or slightly less — a reasonable range is between 40 g minimum and 60 g maximum, considering the visible mass and portion relative to other items. The mid-value around 50 g fits the observed amount well. This estimate checks out visually, as it would not be plausible for the hummous portion to weigh much less or significantly more given its spread and thickness on the plate."

The specified food item is graines de chia (chia seeds). Visually, the dish is a mixture of blanc battu (whipped egg white), flocons d'avoine (oat flakes), graines de chia (chia seeds), and miel (honey). From the image, the pudding-like mixture is creamy and contains visible black chia seeds scattered throughout. Chia seeds are very small and dense, but their volume in such a mixture is usually minor compared to the base of blanc battu and oats. The chia seeds are dispersed and do not form a large bulk by themselves. A typical household portion of chia seeds in a mix like this is between 10 and 25 grams. Considering the visible density and spread of seeds, the amount is likely closer to the mid-range, as the seeds are clearly visible but not overwhelming. The bowl size and mixture volume suggest a moderate portion rather than an excessive one. Therefore, a plausible weight range for the chia seeds is roughly 12-20 grams. Selecting a midpoint, the estimated weight of graines de chia here is 16 grams."

The food item to estimate is 'beurre' which is visible on the plate as a small pat of butter near the bottom right. The butter portion appears to be a single serving pat, approximately 3 to 4 cm long, 1.5 to 2 cm wide, and a height under 1 cm. Given the typical density and shape of butter, this size would roughly correspond to about 10 to 15 grams, with 12 grams as a reasonable midpoint estimate. The butter is a traditional pat and not spread or melted, confirming it is a solid piece. Considering the size relative to the slices of chicken and bread pieces, the portion is not overly large or small. A 10-15 g range fits visually within the context of a Swiss meal portion and the plate size."

The specified food item is 'pain' (bread). From the image, there is one slice of brown bread on the plate. This slice appears to be average-sized, roughly the size of a standard slice of whole grain or rye bread typical in Switzerland. The slice has noticeable thickness and an airy texture with some holes, which reduces its density compared to a very dense bread. Reference objects like the omelette pieces show the bread slice is about 10-12 cm wide and about 1.5-2 cm thick. Considering Swiss bread density and slice size, the plausible weight range is between 30 grams (thin or lighter bread slice) and 50 grams (thicker or denser slice). A midpoint estimate around 40 grams fits well given the visible thickness and size. This is a reasonable estimate based only on what can be seen, without overestimating or underestimating based on typical bread sizes, and correlates to the visual portion on the plate."

The mayonnaise portion is visible on the left side of the plate as a dollop of creamy white sauce. It is not spread thinly but presented as a somewhat compact swirl shape of about 5-6 cm in diameter and about 1.5-2 cm height. Considering mayonnaise density is close to 0.9-1.0 g/ml and that this dollop roughly corresponds to around 2-3 tablespoons visually (each tablespoon about 15 ml), the volume appears about 30-45 ml. This translates to roughly 27-45 grams given the density. The range reflects possible slight under- or over-estimation of thickness and compactness. The portion is not unusually small or large for a condiment serving accompanying this meal. Hence, a midpoint estimate near 35 grams is plausible and fits the observed size relative to the plate and other items."

The specified food item is ""branche de chocolat,"" a chocolate branch typically shaped as a slender, crunchy chocolate bar. From the image, the chocolate bar is about the length of two fingers, roughly 8 to 9 cm long, and appears to be about 1.5 to 2 cm wide and about 1 cm thick. It has embedded crunchy bits, likely nuts or crisped rice, which increase density slightly. Considering that chocolate density is approximately 1.1 g/cm³ and adding the crunchy inclusions, the density might be close to that of solid chocolate. Estimating the volume: length (9 cm) × width (1.8 cm) × thickness (1 cm) = approximately 16.2 cm³. Multiplying by density (1.1 g/cm³) gives approximately 18 grams. Given possible slight variations in thickness and density, a plausible range is 15 to 20 grams. The value near the midpoint is about 18 grams. This seems reasonable for the compact, relatively small chocolate bar shown in the hand."

The specified food item is 'salade' on a red plate. Visually, the salad portion is quite small, consisting mostly of leafy greens with some small pieces of other vegetables or toppings visible. The volume of the salad is limited to a compact pile approximately 6-7 cm long, 4-5 cm wide, and roughly 1.5-2 cm thick. Leafy salad is low in density, approximately 0.2 to 0.3 grams per cubic centimeter, due to air content. Given the limited volume and the nature of the ingredients, a plausible weight range for this small portion of salad is about 15 to 30 grams. Considering the size and appearance, a midpoint estimate around 22 grams is reasonable. This estimate accounts for the small volume and low density without overestimating the portion size. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'salade' visible on the plate is 22 grams."

The specified food item is 'carottes' (carrots). In the image, the carrots are cut into thin slices and scattered throughout the pasta dish. The visible quantity appears limited, with thin slices rather than large chunks, and some pieces are partially embedded within the pasta and vegetables, suggesting the total visible carrot volume is moderate but not dense. Considering the size of the bowl and comparing to the pasta and aubergine portion, the carrots probably represent roughly about 10-15% of the total dish volume since they are thin slices and not very packed. Given typical carrot density and thinness of the slices, the weight is likely in the range of 25-40 grams. Choosing a midpoint, 32 grams is a reasonable estimate. This estimate matches the visual sparse distribution and slice thickness, and is plausible given the volume of the other ingredients and total bowl size. Therefore, 32 grams is a precise and justified estimate for the carrot portion present."

The specified food item is mozzarella, which is the white soft cheese placed on top of the pasta on the plate. Visually, the mozzarella portion appears to be a single dollop approximately 5-6 cm long, roughly 3-4 cm wide, and about 2-3 cm thick. Mozzarella is a soft, moist, and dense cheese, denser than pasta but less dense than hard cheeses. Given the visual volume and density, the mozzarella portion looks like a moderate serving seen in Swiss plates, probably sliced fresh or as a cottage-like mozzarella. Comparing this portion size visually to the pasta volume and the beans, the mozzarella is clearly smaller in volume but compact. Estimating volume roughly as a half oval shape, we get an approximate volume near 40-50 ml. Given the density of fresh mozzarella around 1.1 g/ml (slightly heavier than water), the plausible weight range is approximately 40-55 grams. This is consistent with typical servings of fresh mozzarella dollops on a plate and with what is visible here. Therefore, I select a midpoint estimate near 48 grams, which is neither too small nor too large given the visible quantity."

The image shows four slices of bread each spread with both butter (beurre) and strawberry jam (confiture fraise). The butter is spread as a thin layer, not thick or heaped, which means the volume of butter per slice is quite small. Each slice appears to be a small to medium slice of whole grain or multigrain bread, typical Swiss portion size, roughly around 30-35 grams per slice. Butter density is high, around 0.96 g/ml. Visually, the butter layer covers most of each slice but is thin and uneven, roughly equivalent to about 2-3 grams of butter per slice. With four slices, total butter weight would be approximately 8-12 grams. A plausible weight range, considering slight variations in spread thickness, is 7-13 grams. The midpoint and final estimate, balancing visual appearance and spread thickness, is 10 grams. This estimate does not include the bread or jam weight, only the butter."

The specified food item is 'séré maigre,' which appears as the creamy base mixed with chia seeds and hazelnut purée in the bowl. The bowl looks like a small to medium-sized ramekin or cereal bowl, approximately 10-12 cm in diameter, filled roughly to about 70-80% of its depth with this creamy mixture. The texture looks dense but creamy, consistent with low-fat cottage cheese or similar dairy products, which have a density close to 1 g/ml but potentially slightly lighter due to air incorporated. The volume of the bowl contents is roughly estimated between 150 ml and 200 ml based on visible fill and bowl size. Since 'séré maigre' forms the majority of the mixture (with chia seeds and purée dispersed within it), and given that the chia seeds and purée do not substantially add volume but are mixed in, the weight of 'séré maigre' is approximated at about 80-90% of the total mixture weight. Assuming the total mixture weighs around 160-190 grams (due to viscous, creamy density), the 'séré maigre' portion weighs in a plausible range of 130-170 grams. Choosing a midpoint value with this reasoning, the best estimate for the weight of 'séré maigre' is approximately 150 grams. This estimate is visually grounded on the bowl size, fill level, and mixture consistency, with adjustments for mix-ins and no external standard portion sizes used."

The specified food item is ""galettes millet haricots noirs maïs."" In the image, these are the three brown-orange patties mixed with black beans and yellow corn visible in the bowl. Each patty is about the size of a medium-sized mushroom cap next to them, roughly 6-7 cm in diameter and about 1.5-2 cm thick. The patties appear dense with grains and legumes, which are relatively dense foods. Considering their size and density, each galette likely weighs between 55-75 grams. For three patties, the total plausible weight range is about 165-225 grams. The visual portion seems consistent with a moderate plate serving in Switzerland. Taking the midpoint of this range gives about 195 grams. This value is neither too small nor too large given the visible volume and density, and fits well with the comparison of adjacent items like the mushrooms and salad. Therefore, the best estimate for the combined weight of the three millet, black bean, and corn patties is 195 grams."

The œuf dur (hard-boiled egg) is visually identified as two halves placed on the left side of the plate. Each half shows a typical size for a medium egg, with a firm white and yolk that occupies roughly the center. The plate appears to be a standard dinner plate with the egg halves occupying a small section. The halves are clearly visible and not obscured. A standard medium hard-boiled egg weighs roughly 50 grams in total, including the shell but here without the shell the weight is approximately 45 grams. Since the image shows the peeled halves, the weight corresponds roughly to the edible portion. The halves seem intact and not dried out or partial, so it is a full hard-boiled egg which is cut in two. The visual size also matches a medium egg. Given this, a plausible range is 40-50 grams, and the midpoint and accurate estimate would be 45 grams. This fits well visually with the size of the halves compared to the fork and knife nearby for scale and the other food portions."

The specified food item is 'beurre' (butter), which is visible spread on two slices of bread. Each slice has a thin layer of butter beneath jam on one slice and Nutella on the other. The bread slices are rustic with some air pockets, indicating volume but low density for the bread itself. The butter layer appears thin but covers much of the surface area of each slice. Typical thin butter spreading on bread in Switzerland is about 5-7 grams per slice for a thin layer, but here it looks slightly thinner than a typical full butter cut. Given the bread size (approx. standard sliced rustic bread), the visible butter likely weighs between 4 and 6 grams per slice. Since butter is on two slices, the total butter weight range would be approximately 8 to 12 grams. Choosing a midpoint for accuracy, I estimate the total butter weight to be about 10 grams. This is consistent with the visible spread thickness and coverage, and does not overestimate the weight given the light coverage seen in the image."

The specified food item is 'beurre' (butter). The image shows a slice of tresse (braided bread) with a thin layer of butter underneath a layer of apricot jam (confiture abricot). The butter is thinly and evenly spread, with some areas slightly visible under the jam. The bread slice appears to be about the size of a small to medium slice of brioche or tresse, roughly 10 cm by 6 cm. The butter layer looks thin, likely around 1 to 2 mm thick on average. Butter has a density roughly close to 0.9 g/ml. Estimating the visible buttered surface area as roughly the entire slice top (around 60 cm²) multiplied by an assumed thickness of about 1.5 mm (0.15 cm), the volume of butter is about 60 cm² * 0.15 cm = 9 cm³. Multiplying by the density (approximately 0.9 g/cm³) gives about 8 to 9 grams. Allowing for slight spreading and some areas with less butter, the weight range could plausibly be between 6 and 10 grams. Choosing a midpoint for precision, I estimate 8 grams of butter on the bread slice here. This is consistent with typical thin spreads on a bread slice and aligns well with the visual thin layer observed."

The image shows a folded flatbread (pain/galette) with some filling inside. The galette appears to be of typical size, similar to a large tortilla or flatbread commonly used for wraps. It looks quite thin—about 1 to 2 mm in thickness—and folded over the filling twice or thrice. The pan is a typical lunchbox metal container, and the galette occupies roughly half the length and width of the container. The overall surface area of the galette unfolded is roughly 25 cm by 20 cm on visual estimation. Flatbreads of this size generally weigh between 70 and 100 grams due to their thin dough but relatively dense carbohydrate structure. Because the galette is folded, we see about 2-3 layers, but the weight remains constant relative to full unfolded size. Considering the thickness, area and typical density of such flatbread, a plausible range is 80 to 110 grams. Given the visual thickness and size, an estimate near the midpoint around 95 grams is reasonable and plausible, and the portion does not appear unusually thick or large for Swiss portion standards. The filling is not included in the weight estimate, only the galette itself. This detailed volume and density reasoning leads to the final value."

The specified food item is 'épautre cuit', which is the cooked spelt grains seen in the glass container. The container is a square glass dish, approximately 15 cm x 15 cm, judging by the typical size of the other objects partly visible. The épautre portion covers roughly one-third of the container's bottom area, with a depth visible close to 2 cm. Cooked spelt has a medium density, similar to cooked whole grains such as wheat or barley, so about 1.1 g/ml is a reasonable assumption. Multiplying area (15x15 = 225 cm²) by one-third coverage is 75 cm², and multiplying by 2 cm depth gives a volume close to 150 ml. At 1.1 g/ml, this corresponds to roughly 165 grams. Considering some air gaps and approximation of visual fill, I estimate the weight range between 150 and 180 grams. The midpoint value and best estimate is about 165 grams for the cooked épautre portion visible. This seems plausible and consistent with the visual volume and density cues, and relative portion compared to the other foods in the container."

Butter is dense with a typical density close to 0.9 g/cm³. This small rectangular piece therefore has an approximate volume of 4 cm × 2 cm × 1 cm = 8 cm³. Multiplying by the density gives about 7.2 grams. Considering some slight inaccuracies in thickness or shape, a plausible range would be 6 to 9 grams. The midpoint estimate near 7.5 grams is a reasonable, precise estimate based strictly on visible size and comparison with other items on the plate.

The specified food item is 'parmesan'. Visually, the image shows a plate with a serving of risotto aux asperges parsemé de parmesan. However, the parmesan itself is not visible as a separate identifiable portion like sprinkles or chunks; it appears to be mixed within or melted into the risotto. Given this, the parmesan weight must be estimated based on typical usage in a small plate of risotto. The risotto portion looks about 130-150 grams total. Parmesan in risotto is typically added as a grated, thin layer or mixed in, usually weighing around 5-15 grams for this portion size to add flavor without dominant appearance. Since the parmesan is not visibly distinct and the portion is moderate, a plausible weight range is 7-12 grams. Selecting a middle value gives about 10 grams. This estimation respects the visible lack of parmesan volume and typical usage in a Swiss recipe of this size."

The specified food item is 'beurre' (butter). The image shows two slices of bread on a plate. One slice is spread with a layer of Nutella, and the other slice has a visibly spread butter layer with some mélasse. The butter is spread unevenly with some patches thicker than others. The typical thickness of butter spread on bread is thin, and the visible quantity covers about 60-70% of one slice of moderate-thickness bread. A standard slice of bread from a loaf like this typically weighs around 50 grams. Butter spread thinly like this usually weighs between 5g to 10g per slice depending on the layer's thickness. Given the visible coverage and the texture spreading, a reasonable weight range is 7g to 10g for the butter on this slice. This takes into account the sparse patches where butter thickness varies. Choosing a precise estimate near the midpoint but slightly towards the higher side due to visual coverage near three-quarters, the estimated weight of butter is approximately 9 grams. This complies with plausible portion size and the visual thickness of the spread on the bread."

The specified food item is 'biscuit,' which in the image appears as broken pieces on top of a glass dessert cup containing ice cream, kiwi slices, meringue, and some red sauce. The biscuit pieces look like thin, crisp wafer-like shards rather than a dense biscuit. Their size relative to the glass rim and ice cream scoop is about 4-5 cm in diameter each, and there are 3-4 lighter fragments visible. Given the light, wafer texture and limited thickness (approx. 2-3 mm), these biscuit shards likely weigh less than 15 grams total. Considering the density and visual volume, the plausible range is between 10 g and 15 g, with 12 g being a good estimate near the midpoint. This is consistent with the size and appearance of similar dessert biscuits in Switzerland. The weight does not include other items or the glass. Therefore, an estimate of 12 grams is appropriate for the biscuit portion observed."

The food item 'glace noisette' (hazelnut ice cream) is visually identified as a single scoop or portion in a small bowl. The bowl's diameter is approximately 14-16 cm, based on typical tableware dimensions and visible table space. The ice cream portion sized here is roughly oval, about 8 cm long, 4 cm wide, and about 3 cm thick at the highest point. Ice cream has a density slightly less than water due to air content, typically about 0.5 to 0.7 g/ml. The volume estimation of this scoop is approximately 8 x 4 x 3 = 96 cm³ or ml, but since the shape is not a full cuboid and somewhat irregular, a more realistic volume estimate for the ice cream portion is around 60 to 80 ml. Using the density range, the weight would be roughly between 30 g (if airy) and 56 g (denser). Considering the texture visible in the image (creamy and dense-looking) and Swiss portion size culture, a midpoint of about 45 g is a reasonable precise estimate. The size is too large for a tiny ice cream 'taste' and too small for a big dessert serving, confirming this estimate as plausible."

The specified food item is ""huile de lin"" (linseed/flaxseed oil). In the image, the oil would be a liquid and likely not visible as a standalone portion, most probably used as a dressing or ingredient mixed with the vegetables or the galettes. There is no visible container or separate puddle of oil. Typically, oils added as dressing or for cooking in such a portion would be in the range of about 5 to 15 grams, given the surface area and typical practical use in a meal of this size. The plate is medium-sized and the other foods visible (galettes, purée, tomato, courgette, olives) suggest a single meal serving. Therefore, the oil presence is likely minimal but functional, making the estimated weight of the oil close to the middle of this typical range. The plausible range is 5-15 grams, and a midpoint of around 10 grams is a realistic and reasonable estimate."
p96w4a,oeuf,29.0,28.0,1.0,0.0034413195680550613,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/4e021399-8a90-44fe-b06c-0955cd2280f7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is ""oeuf"" (egg). In the image, the egg is a half portion, placed on the right side of the plate. The egg is hard-boiled and cut in half. A standard hard-boiled egg whole weighs about 50-60 g in total. Since only half of the egg is present, an approximate weight range is 25-30 g. This is consistent with the visual size relative to the other ingredients like the corn kernels and cherry tomatoes, and the plate size. The visible half of the egg is firm and dense, so its weight mostly corresponds to volume. Therefore, a reliable estimate for half a hard-boiled egg here is around 28 g, near the midpoint of the range. This weight fits the physical size and looks plausible from the image."

The specified food item is 'barre de chocolat kinder', which is identified visually as a single white and milk chocolate Kinder Bueno bar segment. Given the visual context, it is a single bar piece placed on a wooden table. A standard full Kinder Bueno bar (2 pieces) weighs about 43 grams, so one half (a single bar segment) weighs around 21.5 grams. The bar in the image corresponds roughly to one half segment. There are no additional bars or broken pieces, so the weight is that of one segment. This matches the visual size and shape, and the density of the bar (chocolate with creamy filling) corresponds to the known product weight. The plausible range for a single bar segment is roughly 20 to 24 grams, so a midpoint estimate of 22 grams is appropriate. This fits well with the visual size and is consistent with Swiss packaging and portion size."

The specified food item is 'barre de chocolat kinder,' which is a Kinder chocolate bar. The image shows a single small Kinder chocolate bar piece on a wooden surface. Kinder bars are known packaged chocolate confectioneries with a typical small individual bar weight. Given the visible size relative to the wood grain and common knowledge of these bars (without using general databases, but based on observable size and typical packaging style), the bar appears to be a standard small chocolate bar piece approximately 20-25 grams. The density of chocolate, combined with the size and thickness visible, fits well within that range. The internal plausible weight range is roughly 18 to 25 grams, centering the estimate near 22 grams to balance any slight variance in size or chocolate density. This is a reasonable and typical weight for a small Kinder chocolate bar segment visible here. Therefore, the best precise estimate grounded in the visual evidence is 22 grams."

The specified food item is 'crème de marrons' visible as a brown spread on a piece of bread ('pain'). The bread piece appears to be about a quarter slice of a small baguette or similar type, judging by its crust and crumb texture. The portion of bread is thin, roughly 10 cm long and around 3-4 cm wide. The spread covers most of the bread surface but is spread in a relatively thin layer, with some spots showing texture of the chestnut cream visible. Chestnut cream is fairly dense but still spreadable, with a density close to a thick jam (~1.2 g/ml). Estimating the volume of spread: about 10 cm x 4 cm surface area = 40 cm², with an average thickness of spread around 2-3 millimeters (0.2 to 0.3 cm) given the visible texture and spread distribution. That gives a volume around 40 cm² x 0.25 cm = 10 cm³ (ml). At a density of about 1.2 g/ml, this corresponds to approximately 12 grams. Considering possible slight variation in thickness and irregularities in spread, a plausible range would be 10-15 grams, with the midpoint close to 12 grams. This estimate is consistent with the visual size of the spread relative to the bread and common application thickness of chestnut cream. Therefore, the most accurate estimate is 12 grams for the crème de marrons spread on the piece of bread shown."

The specified food item is 'salade de céleri,' which is located at the bottom right of the plate as a small mound of white shredded vegetable salad. Comparing it with the other items on the plate (poulet rôti, salade de pomme de terre, and salade de carotte), the portion appears modest. The plate is a standard size of about 23 cm width, giving a good reference for scale. The shredded celery salad looks less dense than the potato salad but denser than a leafy salad. The portion is roughly 6-7 cm across, about 2-3 cm thick, and spread in a compact pile covering around 40-50 cm². Given the shredded nature and moist dressing, the density could be estimated at approximately 0.7-0.9 g/cm³. Multiplying estimated volume by density gives a weight range of about 40-60 grams. The mid-point of this range is about 50 grams, which fits well with visible portion size and typical Swiss portion sizes for this type of salad. Therefore, I estimate the weight as 50 grams."

The specified food item is 'maréchal,' which is visually identified as the small cubes of cheese on the plate. There are about 4 visible cheese cubes, each roughly 1.5 cm per side, which correspond to small cheese cubes typically served in salads. Cheese density is relatively high compared to vegetables; a cubic centimeter of cheese weighs approximately 1 g. Each cube therefore weighs about 3.5 grams (1.5x1.5x1.5 cm = 3.375 cm³) and with 4 cubes, that's approximately 13-15 grams in total. Considering slight variations in size and density, a plausible range is 12-16 grams. This is consistent with the visual size relative to the plate and other items, and normal portion sizes for small cheese toppings in salads. Therefore, the final estimate is near the midpoint, about 14 grams."

The specified food item is 'toast'. In the image, there are two slices of toast on a white plate, both spread thinly with 'fromage frais' (fresh cheese). Each toast slice is roughly square and standard size, likely around 10 cm by 10 cm. Toast bread slices typically weigh around 25-30 grams each in Swiss portions. Considering the slices' visual thickness and density, and that both slices are complete and not partially eaten, the combined weight would be in the range of about 50 to 60 grams. The cheese spread is excluded from this estimate, as it is a separate food item. Since the toast looks standard and uncut, I'll choose the midpoint near 55 grams for the two slices combined."

The specified food is 'barre de chocolat kinder', and we see a single Kinder chocolate bar in the image, lying on a wooden surface. The size can be roughly assessed by comparing it to the width of the wooden planks, which are typically around 7-10 cm wide. The bar fits comfortably in that space and is about 12-13 cm in length. A standard Kinder chocolate bar (such as Kinder Bueno or Kinder Chocolate bar) sold in Switzerland typically weighs close to 20-25 grams per bar segment when individually wrapped. Given the bar's visible size and common formatting, the weight should be close to a single bar piece, not multiple bars. Assuming this is a single standard Kinder chocolate bar piece, the typical weight is about 21 grams. The plausible weight range based on visual volume and density (chocolate) is roughly 18-24 grams; the final estimate near the midpoint is 21 grams. This matches the expected weight of a Kinder chocolate bar fitting the observed size and form in the image. Therefore, the estimate is 21 grams."
p96w4a,mélasse,6.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/b0979eb7-5126-4d9e-9058-64093ecde7e0,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'mélasse,' which visually appears as the thin, light brown spread on the upper slice of bread. The slice of bread looks like a typical French bread slice, about 1.5 cm thick, approximately 12 cm long by 6-7 cm wide. The mélasse layer is thin and spread unevenly across the bread. Given the syrupy texture and visible thin coating, the volume of mélasse is small, likely less than a teaspoon to a teaspoon, which corresponds to roughly 5 to 7 grams by volume and density typical of syrups like molasses. The bread slice itself is quite large but the mélasse is just a thin layer, so the total weight should be low. Considering the density of molasses (about 1.4 g/ml), and judging the coverage amount of approximately 4-5 ml, the weight range can be estimated from 5.5 to 7 grams. Choosing a value near the midpoint to represent a realistic spread, I estimate the weight of the mélasse present to be 6 grams. This is plausible and consistent with the visual cues and food texture."
