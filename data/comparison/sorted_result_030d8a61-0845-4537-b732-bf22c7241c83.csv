The image shows a bowl containing a mixed salad, a portion of beetroot purée, and two galettes of millet, black beans, and corn. The portion of galettes appears to be about 2 to 3 pieces, and considering generous servings of small, dense cakes, each galette is likely around 50 grams based on their size relative to the bowl. Given that the galettes are compact and dense ingredients like millet, beans, and corn typically weigh more than they look, I estimate each at approximately 50 grams. Two galettes total about 100 grams. The salad portion looks to be a handful of mixed greens, likely around 30 grams, and the beetroot purée appears to be roughly 50 grams based on volume and typical serving sizes. Summing these estimates, I arrive at a total of about 180 grams. For the specified item, the galettes, I would estimate approximately 100 grams, assuming the portion shown is typical for a meal-sized serving."

The image shows a portion of roasted vegetables, including pommes de terre (potatoes), fêta (feta), carottes (carrots), panais (parsnips), aubergines (eggplants), and racines rouges (red roots, likely beets). The pile appears to be a mixed medley with varying sizes and shapes of chopped vegetables. The quantity visible suggests a modest serving, typical for a portion per person. The potatoes and carrots are the most prominent, with the potatoes cut into roughly 2-3 cm chunks, which helps estimate volume. The parsnips are similar in size to potatoes, and the eggplants are somewhat smaller, with fewer pieces. The amount of visible pieces and their size roughly align with a total weight around 150 grams. Since this is a mixed, roasted dish with vegetables that are relatively dense, I estimate the total weight at approximately 150 grams, focusing on the panais specifically as part of the mixture."

The plate contains several items: pommes de terre duchesse, poissons panés, ketchup, and mayonnaise. Since I am asked to estimate only the weight of the poissons panés, I will focus on those. There are three fish sticks visible: one at the top, and two toward the bottom left. The fish sticks appear to be of average size, roughly comparable to standard store-bought poissons panés. In Swiss portion sizes, a typical fish fillet or fish stick weighs around 80 grams for a standard portion. Given there are three pieces of similar size, a reasonable estimate would be 3 x 80g = 240g. However, considering that some pieces might be slightly smaller or larger, I'll estimate a range around 200-270 grams. The size and visual appearance suggest that 240 grams is a good middle estimate."

The image shows a meal with three main components: grilled eggplant, scrambled eggs, and cooked lentils. I will focus on estimating the weight of the cooked eggplant, since that is the target item. The eggplant appears to be about three whole spears, each roughly 15-20 cm long and 4-5 cm wide, overlapping slightly. Based on the visual cues and comparison to typical household objects, each spear's size suggests a weight of approximately 80-100 grams, taking into account their length, width, and the cooking process which reduces moisture content and weight. Given there are three pieces, the total weight of the eggplant would be roughly 3 x 90 grams = 270 grams. Adjusting slightly for the possibility of slight variation in size and moisture loss during cooking, I estimate about 250 grams as a reasonable figure."

The image shows a small bowl filled with leafy green vegetables, likely lettuce or similar, combined with a generous amount of white sauce. The leaves are roughly chopped and have a loose, airy appearance, suggesting a light salad. The sauce seems to coat the leaves evenly and appears to be quite thick, which adds volume visually. Given the size of the bowl and the typical portion for a side salad in Switzerland, I estimate the volume to be around 150 grams. The density of fresh leafy greens is low, but the considerable amount of sauce adds weight. Based on the visual cues and typical portion sizes, I estimate the weight of the salade verte + sauce blanche to be approximately 180 grams."

The image shows a slice of tarte à la rhubarbe on a plate. The slice appears to be a standard single serving size, roughly 1/8 of a typical tart. The tart seems to have a thin crust, with a filling layer of rhubarbe pieces, which are cut into chunks. The rhubarbe chunks occupy most of the slice, and their size suggests they are typical for such a tart. Based on visual analysis and knowing that a standard homemade or bakery tart of this size usually weighs around 200-250 grams in total, a single slice typically weighs 25-30 grams. Considering the slice's size and thickness, I estimate the weight at about 27 grams."

The image shows two small tartlettes on a plate with Parisian motifs. The tartlette aux chocolats appears to be about the size of a standard mini tart, roughly 8-9 cm in length and about 3-4 cm in width, with some height from the filling and crust. Based on visual cues, it looks like a dense chocolate filling with a thin crust. Given its dimensions and density, a typical small chocolate tart of this size would weigh around 70-80 grams. The other tartlette aux fraises, although not asked to estimate, appears slightly larger and lighter due to the fruit topping and thinner crust. Therefore, for the tartlette aux chocolats, I estimate the weight to be approximately 75 grams."

The image shows a slice of bread topped with a layer of pain (bread) and a generous amount of crème de marrons (chestnut cream). The bread appears to be a standard baguette slice, approximately 7-8 cm in length and about 4-5 cm wide. The thickness of the bread slice is likely around 1 cm. The crème de marrons spread on top looks quite thick and plentiful, covering nearly the entire surface area of the bread. Given the size of the bread and the amount of cream, I estimate the total weight of this portion to be roughly in the range of 50-70 grams. Since the bread itself accounts for about 25-30 grams, and the crème de marrons appears to constitute a substantial layer, I would estimate the crème de marrons alone to weigh about 25-35 grams. Considering the generous spread, the middle of that range seems most accurate. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the crème de marrons to be approximately 30 grams."

The image shows a large plate with several food items. The sauce aux oignons appears as a small amount of brownish, translucent onion slices near the roast, occupying a very small part of the plate. This portion looks like a light drizzle or a small pile of thinly sliced onions. Given the typical density of cooked onions and their visual volume, this amount seems to weigh approximately 10-15 grams, as it appears to be a small cooked onion portion rather than a sizable heap. I will estimate it at around 12 grams to reflect a small serving typical for a condiment or garnish."

The image shows two pieces of bread ('pain'), each with different spreads on top. The bread pieces are roughly similar in size and look like standard slices, likely to be about 50 grams each based on their size and appearance relative to typical household bread. The upper piece has a light layer of beurre and mélasse, while the lower piece has a darker pâte à tartiner. Since we are only estimating the weight of one piece of pain, I will focus on a single slice. The typical weight of a standard slice of bread in Swiss portions ranges from 40 to 60 grams; given the size shown, 50 grams is a reasonable estimate, with the understanding that the spread adds minimal weight to the bread itself. Therefore, I estimate the weight of one piece of pain to be approximately 50 grams."

The image shows a single piece of brownies au chocolat noir avec noix placed on a yellow paper wrapping. The piece appears to be a standard, roughly square-shaped brownie, with a thickness of about 2 to 3 centimeters. The size of the brownie relative to the paper suggests it is a typical portion, not overly large or small. Given that most brownie portions of this size usually weigh around 50 to 70 grams, and considering the density of a cooked chocolate brownie with added nuts, I estimate the weight to be approximately 60 grams."

The image shows two chocolate bunny figures, each roughly similar in size and shape. These are typical chocolate confections, often shaped like small bunnies. Based on their size relative to the texture of the surface they are on, and assuming they are standard-sized chocolates, each bunny appears to be roughly 5 to 6 centimeters tall with a width of about 3 to 4 centimeters. These shapes are quite dense and compact, indicating a typical thickness and density for chocolate bunnies. Standard small chocolate bunny figures of this size generally weigh around 20 grams each. Since there are two bunnies, and they look like full, intact figures of standard size, I estimate each at around 20 grams, giving a total weight of approximately 40 grams for both."

The image shows two slices of 'gâche' (a type of bread or brioche) spread with a layer of chocolate spread ('pâte à tartiner au chocolat'). Each slice appears to be roughly a standard size for a typical slice of bread. Based on visual comparison with the other objects in the image, such as the glass of orange juice and keys, the slices seem to be about 8-10 cm square with a thickness of around 2-3 cm. Considering the density and typical weight of such bread slices, a standard slice of brioche or similar bread usually weighs between 50-70 grams. Since these slices are moderately thick and appear to be of good size, I estimate each slice weighs about 60 grams. The chocolate spread layer looks thin but covers the entire surface evenly, which might add approximately 5 grams per slice. Therefore, each slice with the spread is approximately 65 grams. Given the context and typical portion size, this estimate is reasonable."
