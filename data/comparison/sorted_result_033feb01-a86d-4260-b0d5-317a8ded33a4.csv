2ahgvr,salade grecque,315.0,125,190.0,7.028772753963594,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/c476a6d0-acb2-45fd-b168-84822bc98003,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I visually identify the 'salade grecque' in the rectangular plastic container. All the contents inside - cut pieces of cucumber, tomato, onion, yellow pepper, black olive, and cubes of feta cheese - correspond to a typical Greek salad. For dimension analysis, I observe that this is a small Swiss-style Tupperware container, only partially filled. The salad fills about one-third of the height and covers much of the bottom area. Comparing to the standard meal prep containers and the size of vegetables, this portion represents a moderately packed and visually dense small salad. Greek salad is somewhat dense due to heavy ingredients like cucumber and feta. I account for the depth, since the layer is about a centimeter thick, and there are no large empty spots. For Swiss context and this moderate portion, a full container would be 350-400g; this is about 1/3 of that. My estimated range is 110-140g, and since the portion sits around one-third full, I choose 125g as a precise mid-estimate."
wrah5h,"délice des dieux (biscuit, fruits rouges, séré+mascarpone)",325.0,135,190.0,7.251908396946565,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/560d1e28-3692-4e4d-bdaf-3abb5f44be7a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification. The 'délice des dieux' (biscuit, fruits rouges, séré+mascarpone) is clearly the dessert portion on the plate. It has a visible biscuit base, a middle layer with fruits rouges (raspberries, maybe some blueberries or similar), and a thick séré+mascarpone topping. Step 2: Dimension Analysis. The portion is rectangular, occupying about a third of a standard dessert plate. It appears to be about 9x9 cm (using plate size and raspberry size for scale), and roughly 3.5 cm high (with a substantial cream layer). Step 3: Density Considerations. The layers consist of (1) a dense biscuit base (typically about 1 cm thick), (2) fruit/red berry compote layer (also about 1 cm), and (3) mascarpone/séré cream (about 1.5 cm). Biscuit base and mascarpone layer are quite dense (comparable to cheesecake), while the berry layer is lighter but still significant. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration. Such a slice, in a Swiss context, is medium-sized for a plated dessert. Internal estimate: biscuit base ~40g, berry layer ~25g, cream layer ~70g, for a subtotal of about 135g. Given the full cross-validation (portion not especially large or small, nor extra heavy cream, and no hidden depth missed), the most visually grounded estimate for this single portion is 135 grams."
p8a2w5,sandwich bahn mi au bœuf,313.0,155,158.0,5.807868467410452,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/022d6625-56d2-43cd-a1e0-77ae2cf08703,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visually identify the target food. The specified item is 'sandwich bahn mi au bœuf', and there is one visibly whole bánh mì sandwich on the paper. Step 2: Dimension analysis. The sandwich appears to be made with a small Swiss-style baguette, much shorter and thinner than a standard French baguette (Swiss portions are smaller). Comparing to the parchment paper and the apparent absence of a plate, I estimate this baguette to be about 18-20 cm long and quite slender, probably 5-6 cm in width and around 4-5 cm in height/thickness. Step 3: Density consideration. The composition is classic bánh mì: baguette, visible slices of pickled daikon and cucumber, fresh herbs (cilantro), shredded carrot, and likely a modest serving of cooked beef (not heavily filled). The bread is crusty and airy, the filling includes both dense (beef) and light (vegetables, herbs) ingredients. The sandwich appears lighter than a densely filled sub, and the beef is not the predominant component visually. Step 4: Portion calibration. For a small Swiss-style bánh mì with modest beef and a good amount of vegetables, a reasonable weight range is 140-180g. This sandwich looks like a typical Swiss takeaway portion (smaller than US or Parisian versions), so I will use the lower-middle of the range. Step 5: Cross-validation. Considering that the baguette alone likely weighs around 75-80g, and with the visible modest vegetables and a probable 30-40g of beef, my total estimate is around 155 grams, reflecting a standard Swiss lunchtime sandwich portion."
6fwmw2,mélange de porc et légumes façon thaï,295.0,160,135.0,4.677040516735174,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/6fwmw2/dish_media/ec6d03db-ac9d-4ca2-92e1-96ab989361cb,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I identified the 'mélange de porc et légumes façon thaï' as the saucy mixture covering the noodles, consisting of visible pieces of pork, carrots, bell pepper, broccoli, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and a creamy sauce. The mixture extends heavily across the top of the noodles, occupying most of the upper surface of a medium-sized, deep bowl. For dimension analysis, the visible layer appears fairly thick and is not just a surface drizzle—there's clear volume and substance. The mixture is dense, composed mainly of protein and cooked vegetables, which retain weight even after cooking. Comparing to known portion sizes, a typical Swiss home-style serving of such a mixture atop noodles would be between 120g (small) and 180g (generous). This portion fully covers the noodles, with some of the sauce and chunks hanging over the sides; the bowl seems about a third full with the mixture. Choosing a mid-to-upper range for this portion, but avoiding overestimation, I estimate the weight of the 'mélange de porc et légumes façon thaï' to be 160 grams."
r3bub9,millet,201.0,120,81.0,1.9120375807398708,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/r3bub9/dish_media/caf038e8-cc51-41c3-ae34-63959a1e6ad6,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a square plate with two main food portions: a creamy meat dish on the left and a pile of millet on the right. First, I identify the millet: it is distinct from the saucy meat dish, placed as a loose mound occupying about a third of the plate area. For dimension analysis, a standard dinner plate in Switzerland is typically about 25cm wide, and the millet mound covers a section roughly 9cm by 9cm, with an uneven, loose depth. The millet is not tightly packed but not extremely fluffy either, suggesting a medium density similar to cooked couscous, which is about 1.1 g/ml. Visually, the mound seems about 1.5-2 cm deep on average. Approximating the shape to a rough cube: 9cm x 9cm x 1.5cm = ~120ml volume. Multiplying by typical cooked millet density, that's 120ml x 1.1g/ml ≈ 132g. Adjusting downward slightly since the pile is not completely level and allowing for Swiss (modest) portion size, I estimate the weight of the millet to be about 120 grams."
xjvrtk,galettes millet haricots noirs maïs,200.0,120,80.0,1.8790369935408104,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/32289b41-a85a-4563-8e38-c47e7693d2d0,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, visually identify the 'galettes millet haricots noirs maïs' in the image. They are the three orange-brown patties, visibly containing millet grains, black beans, and corn. Step 1: I locate three galettes, stacked and overlapping but separate enough to see their boundaries. Step 2: Each galette is about the size of a large cookie, approximately 6-7 cm in diameter and about 1-1.5 cm thick. Comparing to the size of the mushrooms and salad leaves next to them, each one is compact and dense. Step 3: Millet and black beans are relatively dense, similar to cooked grains and legumes, so their apparent size will underestimate the true weight. Step 4: For portion calibration, a standard homemade vegetable/legume patty this size in Switzerland typically weighs 35-45g each. For three, that produces a visual range of 105-135g. These do not look overly large or small so the portion is around the middle of the range. Step 5: Cross-check that not much is hidden under other foods; only a little overlap is present and no significant hidden volume. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the galettes millet haricots noirs maïs to be 120 grams."
p8a2w5,"dalh de lentilles corail (lentilles corail, oignon, carottes, tomates concassées, 1cs huilde d'olive, épices)",271.0,200,71.0,2.2596594245449206,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/82b53493-1c97-472b-9ec6-8cc698b8cfe4,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, the target food is 'dalh de lentilles corail (lentilles corail, oignon, carottes, tomates concassées, 1cs huilde d'olive, épices)'. In the image, the dahl is the orange-red portion on the right half of the bowl, distinct from the white rice. The dahl appears to contain visible lentils, carrots, and onions, with a thick, stew-like consistency. The bowl is filled to about 2/3 capacity, split roughly half and half between rice and dahl. The bowl itself is a standard medium-sized soup/cereal bowl (Swiss context, about 13-15 cm diameter), but not heaped. Estimating the volume, it looks like about 180-200 ml of dahl (since rice is similarly portioned and bowl is not especially deep). Cooked lentil dahl is dense, containing little air, similar to chili or thick stew; 1ml ≈ 1g for this type of dish. To avoid underestimating, I will assume depth is slightly greater than the central portion suggests, accounting for the curve of the bowl filled to the rim (as dahl can settle lower in the middle). Given that it's a substantial but not oversized serving and following Swiss norms, the dahl portion is likely between 160g (small) and 230g (large). For this bowl and visible amount, a medium-to-large Swiss portion is most precise, so I estimate the dahl at 200 grams."
p96w4a,tarte à la rhubarbe,105.0,170,65.0,0.8015267175572519,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/e0c92380-fc15-4bbe-90fb-cc2936321050,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual identification. The image shows a single, large triangular slice of tarte à la rhubarbe on a plate, with a standard table knife and fork for scale. Step 2: Dimension analysis. The slice is about one-sixth of a standard tart, judging by the curvature and surface area, and it nearly spans the plate's diameter. Comparing to the utensils, the slice is approximately 12-14 cm at its longest edge and about 8-9 cm at the base, with a visible depth of roughly 2.5 cm. Step 3: Density considerations. The tart slice consists of a pastry base, a fairly thick rhubarb custard layer, and generous chunks of rhubarb, making this a moderately dense dessert; heavier than a dry cake but lighter than a dense meat pie. Step 4: Portion size calibration. A standard whole Swiss rhubarb tart typically weighs 900-1100g. For one large slice (about 1/6th of a tart), a plausible range is 140-185g, with average density. Given the visible size and fullness of toppings, this piece should be at the medium-to-upper end of that range. Step 5: Cross-validation. No container weight is included, and depth is clearly visible. The estimation falls in line with Swiss-sized tarts (not oversized). Therefore, the weight of this slice of tarte à la rhubarbe is estimated at 170 grams."
wrah5h,sauce tomate,117.0,55,62.0,0.8519083969465648,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/8de465e6-eb71-4c8f-8cdb-f587e9c8bef8,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I need to identify the 'sauce tomate' in the image. The dish appears to be a lunchbox containing tagliatelles (pasta), omelette aux tomates (egg with tomatoes on the left), gruyère râpé (grated cheese, on top), and tomato sauce ('sauce tomate'). The tomato sauce is visibly coating the tagliatelles and mixed into some areas with cheese, with a reddish-orange appearance streaked through the noodles and slightly pooling underneath. Based on the amount visible, it looks like the sauce is lightly but evenly distributed over the pasta, not a thick or heavy layer. For Swiss portion context, sauce is typically more reserved compared to US servings. Considering the sauce is not gathered as a pool but clings thinly to the pasta, I estimate the sauce forms a moderate coating of perhaps 2 to 3 tablespoons (about 30-45g), but I need to adjust upward for the portion size and hidden sauce underneath the noodles, likely increasing this to 50-60g. Based on the coverage, bowl area (medium lunchbox), and pasta density, a reasonable estimate for the tomato sauce is 55 grams."
2ahgvr,porridge salé,48.0,110,62.0,0.3495008807985907,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a35f3211-3b33-4826-97b8-3af69655dada,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a glass jar containing porridge salé. Step 1: VISUAL IDENTIFICATION. The only food visible is the porridge salé, which occupies roughly half of the jar. Step 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS. The jar is an average small home canning jar (about 212 ml), and the porridge fills just under half of the jar, so about 100 ml. The porridge appears moderately thick and compact, with some separation indicating a cooked oat base with liquid. Step 3: DENSITY CONSIDERATIONS. Cooked porridge is dense due to its combination of oats and milk/water, typically around 1.1g/ml. Step 4: PORTION SIZE CALIBRATION. A small portion, visualized as about 100 ml, yields around 110 grams. Step 5: CROSS-VALIDATION. The visible volume, density of cooked oats, and jar size support this estimate, and I am not including the weight of the jar. Therefore, the best estimate for the weight of the porridge salé is 110 grams."
wrah5h,omelette aux tomates,209.0,150,59.0,1.4481503229594832,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/c4d2e0f7-71f7-4e23-bc37-43a0aff738da,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I will visually identify the 'omelette aux tomates': it occupies the bottom half of the plate, cut into two large triangular wedges, with visible chunks of tomato embedded throughout. The two pieces appear thick (about 1.5-2 cm) and broad, each about the size of a medium slice of bread—which provides a good reference for size. Judging by the plate size and comparing to typical Swiss home portions, this looks like a medium 2-egg omelette with a generous amount of tomato. Eggs and tomatoes both have moderate density, and the omelette here appears fluffy but still substantial rather than thin. For a 2-egg omelette with tomato, the typical raw starting weight is 2 eggs (approx. 50g each) + about 40-60g of tomato, yielding a total uncooked weight near 140-160g; after cooking, there is some moisture loss, but tomatoes retain some liquid. Given the visual thickness, size, and density, I estimate the weight of the omelette aux tomates as 150 grams."
m4egh2,sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon),98.0,43,55.0,0.6330005871990605,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/6b91ac4b-1f0f-4176-bf40-a12a6cd892e2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon)'. In the image, the sauce is visually noticeable as a creamy layer coating the pasta and as visible moistness on the mushrooms. There are also clumps of sauce adhering to several mushroom pieces scattered throughout the pasta. The sauce does not appear pooled at the bottom but is integrated into the pasta, suggesting it is not an excessive amount but enough to coat the noodles and mushrooms. Given that this is a typical Swiss meal (smaller portion), and considering visual density from the cream and distribution, a normal serving would include 2 to 3 tablespoons of sauce, likely weighing 35–50 grams. Cross-referencing with the total visible volume and the sauce coverage, and knowing that thick cream-based sauces can be denser than they look, the likely total is on the lower-middle range. Therefore, the estimated weight of 'sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon)' is 43 grams."
wrah5h,salade verte + sauce blanche,97.0,45,52.0,0.5923664122137404,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/e70834e6-948f-4497-a162-e7f604b1b041,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'salade verte + sauce blanche', which is a green salad with white dressing. Step 1: Visually, the salad is the entirety of what is in the bowl; it consists mostly of leafy greens (likely lettuce varieties), with a creamy white sauce coating and a few visible seeds. The leaves are lightly packed but not squashed. Step 2: For size reference, the bowl is placed on a standard dinner plate, so I calibrate its diameter at about 10-12 cm. The salad nearly fills the bowl to the top, but given the airy texture and visible gaps between leaves, the actual mass is less than it appears. Step 3: Lettuce is very light and voluminous, and salad dressing can add a bit of weight but is not overwhelming in visible quantity. A small handful of salad in a medium bowl like this usually weighs 25-40g plain; with sauce included, and some seeds, this amount is moderately increased. Step 4: Considering this is a Swiss-sized portion (smaller than US), the volume looks like a medium to small salad bowl, so I'll calibrate in the 35-50g range. Step 5: Given the density, visible leaf volume, and coating, the most accurate estimate is near the midpoint for this size, erring slightly higher for the sauce: 45 grams."
ppf8hc,poissons panés,132.0,80,52.0,0.8061068702290076,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/ddb88e9f-bf1c-4010-9d5a-1181e9cbe810,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual identification. The 'poissons panés' (breaded fish) are clearly visible as three rectangular, golden-brown pieces on the left side of the plate. Step 2: Dimension analysis. Comparing the pieces to the Duchess potatoes and the diameter of the plate, each breaded fish piece appears to be typical of Swiss portioned frozen fish fingers—about 7-8 cm long, 3 cm wide, and about 1 cm thick. Step 3: Density considerations. Breaded fish is moderately dense due to the fish inside and the breading outside; typical fish fingers of this size usually weigh 25-30 grams per piece. Step 4: Portion size calibration. There are three pieces, all similar in size, suggesting this is a standard small/medium plate portion. Minimum estimate for three small pieces is about 75 grams, maximum for three full-size would be 90 grams. These pieces appear to be in the middle ground. Step 5: Cross-validation. Not overcounting (exactly three pieces), no hidden layers, no triple stacking. The visual size aligns with the expectation for Swiss kids' meals or adult small portions. Thus, the most reasonable estimate for the total weight is 80 grams."
r3bub9,myrtilles,105.0,55,50.0,0.6165590135055784,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/r3bub9/dish_media/603ab0c1-fb02-43f7-be06-38103f12b019,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visually identifying the target food item, 'myrtilles' (blueberries), I can see that there is a loosely spread pile of blueberries on a flat, square plate, with none clearly hidden or layered deeply. Step 2: For dimension analysis, I note that these are typical medium-to-large blueberries (Swiss context), each approximately 1–1.3 cm in diameter, similar in size to a small marble. Step 3: Blueberries have a moderate density, with each berry typically weighing about 1.2–1.5 grams. Step 4: I count roughly 42 individual berries visible on the plate. Multiplying by an average weight of 1.3 grams per berry (for a conservative Swiss portion), gives approximately 54.6 grams. Step 5: Cross-validating: the spread is modest and not piled, fitting a small-to-medium serving. This weight aligns with the apparent quantity and density. Therefore, the most accurate estimate for the myrtilles on this plate is 55 grams."
xjvrtk,pomme,123.0,75,48.0,0.693364650616559,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/1fc4280d-6873-48b5-b707-ac4c7d54caa6,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visually identify the 'pomme' (apple). The image shows a single apple that has been sliced neatly in half, with one half prominently displayed and held in a hand. Step 2: Dimension analysis. The half apple appears roughly palm-sized, typical for a medium Swiss apple. Considering the size relative to the hand, the width is about 7-8 cm, height about 7-8 cm, and thickness about 3-4 cm. Step 3: Density considerations. Apples are dense, high-water fruits. A whole medium apple, including its core, typically weighs about 140-160g in Swiss context. The core and seeds are intact here. Step 4: Portion size calibration. Only one half of the apple is visible and considered; typically, this half would be 70-80g because the average Swiss apple is about 150g (for the whole apple), subtracting nothing since the core remains. Step 5: Cross-validation. The estimated 75g for half the apple aligns with the visual size and typical weights. Therefore, the estimated weight of the visible 'pomme' half is 75 grams."
6fwmw2,perle de blé,138.0,95,43.0,0.696887844979448,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/6fwmw2/dish_media/1da85bf5-675f-472d-8594-733069301dd5,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I identify the 'perle de blé' (wheat pearls) in the image: they are the small, round, light-colored grains making up about half the contents of the bowl, concentrated on the left side mixed with shrimp and sauce. Step 1: I visually estimate that the perle de blé occupy roughly half of a standard medium bowl. Step 2: Comparing the grains to the shrimp size and the bowl (typical Swiss portion, about 14-16cm across), I estimate the wheat pearls have a layer depth of roughly 2-2.5cm in their section, extending underneath some haricot coco and shrimp. Step 3: Perle de blé are denser than cooked rice by a little and typically heavier than they appear, especially when packed with sauce. Step 4: For a medium Swiss portion, I would expect 80-120 grams cooked perle de blé in such a serving size; since this bowl is not piled high, I opt toward the intermediate-low end. Step 5: Visually confirming the proportion of the bowl filled, accounting for mixing and spread with the sauce and not overestimating volume, my best estimate for the amount of perle de blé present is approximately 95 grams."
ppf8hc,pain,106.0,63,43.0,0.5352906635349384,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/5495e975-cddc-4f5d-b496-a3e51d50cf86,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual identification – the target food is 'pain' (bread) and there are three slices visible, each partially spread with chocolate spread. Step 2: Dimension analysis – each slice appears to be a cross section of a medium multigrain baguette or small loaf, approximately 8-10 cm long and 4-5 cm wide, and about 1.5 cm thick. Comparing to the visible texture/size of the seeds and the spreading knife lines gives further confirmation of the slice dimensions. Step 3: Density consideration – multigrain bread is moderately dense, but these slices look to have a somewhat open crumb (visible holes), so less dense than a typical sandwich loaf. A typical slice of this size and bread variety weighs about 20-25g. Step 4: Portion calibration – with three slices, and some open holes reducing weight slightly, the range is 18-25g per slice. For a conservative, Swiss portion, let's take the midpoint, about 21g per slice. 3 slices × 21g = 63g total for the bread. Step 5: Cross-validation – the slices are not very thick, and some holes reduce the total bread mass, so this estimate remains realistic. Therefore, the estimated weight of 'pain' is 63 grams."
xjvrtk,carotte,100.0,60,40.0,0.4697592483852026,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/1fa390c1-9169-42c0-abbd-3aa6e1a5c90b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I identified the grated carrot ('carotte') in the bowl; it occupies roughly one third of the upper part of the bowl, mostly on the right side. The carrot is grated and creates a textured, somewhat fluffy pile, which can make it look larger than its actual weight. For volume comparison, the carrot covers a substantial area and appears slightly piled, creating an internal depth. Based on the size of the bowl (comparable to a standard Swiss salad bowl of about 16-18 cm diameter) and visual comparison with the cucumber and tomato pieces, I estimate the grated carrot portion would come from a medium-sized carrot or a bit more. Grated carrot tends to have a density of about 45-50 grams per 100 ml tightly packed, and here the carrot is moderately packed. The volume seems about 1 to 1.5 Swiss handfuls, roughly 100-130 ml. Therefore, a reasonable estimation for the weight of the grated carrot is approximately 60 grams."
wrah5h,pain/galette,90.0,50,40.0,0.4227833235466823,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/e3bda09e-e437-4ac8-bfbf-4f282e801bfc,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification. The image shows a rectangular stainless steel container with one large wrap (galette) that appears to be cut into two pieces. The focus is only on pain/galette, so only the tortilla/wrap bread should be estimated, not the filling. Step 2: Dimension Analysis. The wrap appears to be of standard tortilla/galette size, covering most of the long side of the container. Comparing its size to typical Swiss serving wraps, the total length is about 22-24 cm, and its width is 14-16 cm, with a typical thickness for wraps. Step 3: Density Considerations. The bread is dense and compact but not as heavy as filled foods; processed wraps are standardized in weight, usually lighter than they appear but denser than sliced sandwich bread. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration. Standard galette wraps (for burritos/tacos) in Switzerland are almost always 45-60 grams each. These pieces together appear to make a single wrap, rolled and cut, so we estimate one whole galette. Step 5: Cross-Validation. No hidden sections are visible, and this matches expectations for a single full-size wrap. Standard size in Switzerland is typically 50 grams when plain. Therefore, my best estimate for the weight of the pain/galette (just the bread part) is 50 grams."
m4egh2,panais,13.0,52,39.0,0.059541984732824425,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/c31013e3-9c81-4ba6-b85b-e3c45b062457,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I need to identify the 'panais' (parsnips) in the image. The parsnip pieces are the off-white, slightly tan chunks, distinguishable from potatoes (yellow with skin), carrots (orange rounds), beets (deep red), eggplant (soft purple-gray), and feta (small white chunks). There are several parsnip pieces spread throughout the dish, with visible chunk thickness and length. Comparing to plate size and other vegetables, the visible parsnip pieces look like roughly 1/5 of the total mound of food. Taking into account the density—parsnips are similar in density to potatoes and denser than eggplant/cooked beetroot—I visually gauge all visible parsnip pieces together would weigh about as much as a small handful, likely in the 40-60g range. Given the Swiss context (modest portions) and the fact that some parsnip may be hidden beneath other vegetables, a reasonable estimate lands in the middle of the range. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of panis on this plate to be 52 grams."
r3bub9,fraises,120.0,81,39.0,0.549618320610687,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/r3bub9/dish_media/66eb357e-01df-484a-a659-067d685251c5,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I will visually identify and count the strawberry ('fraises') pieces. There are about 12 distinct pieces, consisting of halves and quarters—indicating roughly 6 whole strawberries. The pieces are small to medium-sized, fitting comfortably on a medium plate with extra space. Considering Swiss portion sizes tend to be modest and comparing the pieces to the plate, each whole strawberry would weigh around 12-15 grams. For 6 strawberries, the estimated weight would thus be in the range of 72-90 grams. Accounting for the variation in strawberry size (some seem a bit larger, others smaller), and given their density (not overly light or dense), I will select a value near the center of the range. Therefore, my best estimate for the total weight of the 'fraises' is 81 grams."
p8a2w5,banane,159.0,120,39.0,0.7282442748091603,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/30871e66-f14d-428a-8d8c-403bc6c2af75,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single whole banana ('banane') resting on a couch. To visually estimate its size, I note the standard shape and length relative to the couch's seat seam and upholstery texture. This banana appears slightly smaller and shorter than a typical US banana; remembering Swiss context, portions are often smaller. The width and curvature look average—not particularly thick or thin. A standard medium banana in Switzerland typically weighs about 120-130 grams including the peel, but given the visually modest size, I lean toward the lower end of this range. Adjusting for portion and visual context, I estimate the weight to be approximately 120 grams."
r3bub9,kiwi,118.0,80,38.0,0.526600117439812,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/r3bub9/dish_media/aba4b4e9-dcb4-47cc-b113-116786ec97b1,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single whole kiwi with its skin. There are no reference objects for exact size comparison, but the shape and visible proportions suggest a standard commercial kiwi, which in Switzerland tends to be slightly smaller than larger export varieties. Typical Swiss kiwis weigh between 70 and 90 grams when whole with skin. Given the appearance—not especially large or small—I assess this as a medium kiwi, so the weight should be somewhere in the middle of the range. Taking into account the slightly smaller Swiss context, I estimate the weight of the kiwi is approximately 80 grams."
wrah5h,avocat,78.0,40,38.0,0.3480916030534351,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/712f4686-2c54-47d3-a8f2-811e15f6e76b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification. The target food item is 'avocat' (avocado). In the image, the avocado is clearly located at the top-left quadrant, sliced into two thick wedges with some onion slices on top. Both slices look like they are from a medium-sized avocado, and there are no other obvious pieces of avocado mixed with the other vegetables. Step 2: Dimension Analysis. Both avocado slices together make up about 1/4 to 1/3 of a whole avocado when compared to the other foods and the standard size of a lunchbox compartment. The slices are thick, about 1.5 cm in depth, with a combined length of around 8-9 cm. Step 3: Density Considerations. Avocado is a dense and creamy fruit, and appears heavier than it looks. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration. A full medium Swiss avocado typically weighs 180g with skin and pit, or about 120g edible portion. Since we see about 1/4 to 1/3 of a whole, that's between 30g and 40g. These are generous slices, but not more than a third. Step 5: Cross-Validation. Comparing the avocado volume to the other foods (especially the cubes of tofu for reference), my estimate is toward the higher end for 1/4 to 1/3 of a medium avocado. Therefore, the estimated weight of 'avocat' is approximately 40 grams."
xjvrtk,épautre cuit,160.0,125,35.0,0.6576629477392836,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/02911570-1e99-4b2c-9ad0-469321a8a342,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I need to visually identify the 'épautre cuit' (cooked spelt) in the image. The épautre cuit appears in the top left section of the square glass container, clearly separated from the scrambled eggs (top right) and roasted eggplant (bottom). Step 1: The épautre cuit fills about one third of the visible area of the container. Step 2: For dimension analysis, the glass box appears to be a standard Swiss lunchbox, roughly 13x13 cm, and is filled to a medium-depth (I estimate around 3 cm deep, not fully compacted). The épautre layer looks slightly loose but substantial, and I can see some grains layered underneath at the sides, suggesting there might be a bit more depth than is directly apparent. Step 3: Spelt is a dense, cooked whole grain and maintains a moderate weight per visual volume, similar to cooked barley. Step 4: Portion calibration — in a Swiss context, a standard cooked grain serving in a lunchbox is usually 80–120g, but this is a generously filled segment, above the smallest portion but not overflowing, so I’d set a range of 100-140g. Since the épautre takes up around a third of a full lunchbox and appears about medium-full, I will estimate towards the mid-high of that range. Step 5: Cross-validating—grains are sometimes underestimated, but based on the visible volume and density, my final estimate for the cooked spelt is 125 grams."
p96w4a,riz basmati,111.0,145,34.0,0.4432178508514386,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/7f4eeb93-0192-4be4-a9fe-ae6803bb1441,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I locate the riz basmati on the plate: it is the large mound of white rice in the lower center and left part of the plate. The rice is not compacted, but loosely piled, with a fluffy texture characteristic of cooked basmati rice. The portion is visually compared to the other foods on the plate and to the standard 24-26cm Swiss dinner plate, suggesting a medium portion size. The rice pile covers approximately a third of the plate, with a moderate height (not a flat layer—there appears to be at least 2-3cm depth). Cooked rice is denser than it looks, commonly underestimated. A standard Swiss portion of cooked basmati rice typically ranges from 100g (small) to 180g (large); based on the size here, this portion is between a medium and generous serving, but not overflowing. Accounting for the depth and surface area, I estimate the weight of the rice to be approximately 145 grams."

First, I will identify and visually separate the 'riz' (rice) from the other foods on the plate. The rice is the white, fluffy component sitting under the ratatouille (red vegetable stew) and next to the eggs. There are no obstructions, but some rice is covered by the ratatouille, so I must estimate the total volume. Next, I compare the rice's portion size to the eggs and plate size: this appears to be a medium-sized dinner plate. The visible rice portion looks like roughly a piled segment taking up approximately 1/4 of the plate, with additional rice under the ratatouille. The mound of rice is thicker than a mere surface layer, with height comparable to the ratatouille heap, suggesting significant depth/density. Considering the density of cooked white rice (relatively dense and compact), a standard Swiss portion for rice is about 120g (for a small portion) to 160g (medium) or even 180g (large). Given the visual volume, accounting for hidden rice beneath the sauce and the mound By cross-referencing against standard objects (like the large fried eggs and general plate size), I'd classify this as a medium-to-large portion. Accounting conservatively for hidden rice, I estimate the weight to be about 150 grams."
wrah5h,soufflé au fromage,158.0,125,33.0,0.6123311802701116,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/8a56b91d-8126-42ef-8395-9d7084cc4b44,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I need to visually identify the 'soufflé au fromage' on the plate. It is the puffy, golden-brown, slightly browned portion on the right side of the plate. The soufflé is distinct from the ratatouille (colorful vegetable mix, top left) and the rice (white, bottom left). Next, I'll analyze the size by comparing the soufflé to the rice and the overall plate size. The plate appears to be a standard dinner plate (about 25 cm across). The soufflé portion is irregular in shape and has visible height: it is partly airy with a crust, and some denser volume underneath, taking up roughly a quarter of the plate. The visible portion includes both crust and fluffy interior with evident thickness (about 3-5 cm high, possibly more at the right edge), and it looks like roughly a large serving scoop or two. Soufflé is quite light for its size due to its airy structure and egg/cheese composition, so I need to avoid overestimating. Based on the visual size and airiness, a portion this size (Swiss context: moderate, not overly generous) would typically weigh in the range of 110-140g. Given the apparent volume (fairly large for soufflé but not a double portion) and its airy structure, I will select a point toward the middle of the range, accounting for both crust and interior. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'soufflé au fromage' to be 125 grams."
wrah5h,pomme,138.0,105,33.0,0.5348209042865532,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/6b584efc-e8bb-46a4-8a19-5e1cc53e7527,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I visually identify the 'pomme' (apple) slices in the image. There are four distinct pieces of apple in the container. Judging by their size relative to the small rectangular container, each piece seems to be a wedge from a medium apple, which typically yields 6-8 wedges in total. These look like substantial wedges, suggesting they represent around half to two-thirds of an average Swiss apple. An average medium apple in Switzerland weighs about 150-170 grams whole (including skin and core). Since these are just the flesh and some skin, and the core appears to be partly present in one piece, I'll estimate that these pieces account for about 60-70% of the full apple's weight. That would make the total weight approximately in the range of 90-120 grams. Considering the visible amount and density, I estimate the weight of the apple pieces to be 105 grams."

The image shows two half-slices of bread on a small to medium Swiss-style plate. Both pieces appear to be from a round, rustic loaf, cut into thick chunks—each about the size of a small to medium bread roll cut in half. Comparing their size to the butter knife, each half-slice is approximately 7-8 cm in diameter and about 3 cm thick. At a conservative Swiss standard, these are not oversized, and the crust is visible but not excessive. The crumb has a soft, airy texture but enough density to be substantial. A typical slice of this kind of bread weighs about 30-35g per half (60-70g total for a standard whole round slice, which matches Swiss nutritional databases for pain mi-blanc or pain de campagne). Given both halves are included and look to be from the same slice, I estimate the total weight of 'pain' (bread only, not spreads) at 65 grams."

First, the target food item is 'gaufre'. In the image, there is one full rectangular waffle visible on the plate, and it appears whole with no pieces missing. For visual scale, the plate is of standard size, and the waffle nearly fills its center, indicating it's a single serving and not an oversized portion. European/Swiss waffles are typically a bit smaller and less dense than classic Belgian or American waffles, but still substantial. Standard homemade or bakery waffles of this kind usually weigh between 65g and 90g per piece, with thickness factored in (this waffle is about 2-2.5cm thick). Since the waffle is not extra large or extra thin and taking into consideration the Swiss context (slightly smaller/lighter portions), the most reasonable estimate for this visually confirmed single waffle is at the lower-middle end of that range. Therefore, my estimate for the weight of the 'gaufre' is 75 grams."

The target food item is 'pomme' (apple). In the image, a single apple is held in a hand. Step 1: Visual identification confirms only one whole apple is present, with no portions cut off. Step 2: For dimension analysis, the apple fits comfortably in an adult hand, appearing smaller than large supermarket apples. In the Swiss context, apples given for snacks are often small to medium, typically 6-7 cm in diameter. Step 3: Apple is a moderately dense fruit (close to water, about 0.85-0.9 g/ml). Step 4: Portion size calibration: small-to-medium, especially since it does not overwhelm the palm or spill over the fingers, so we take the lower to middle portion of typical apple weights. Average medium apple is 150-180g, but this looks smaller. Step 5: Cross-validation: no hidden portions, no core removed. Given all evidence, I estimate the weight at about 120 grams."

First, I visually locate the quinoa, which is the grain covering approximately half of the surface area in the bowl. The quinoa is spread relatively thickly and occupies the lower left to top right corner, with a clear pile that fills the bowl's bottom layer and rises up at least a centimeter, possibly more where it's piled. Comparing to the asparagus spears and the salmon piece, the bowl looks to be a medium size (Swiss portion context). I estimate the diameter of this type of bowl to be about 15 cm. If spread evenly to about 1-1.5 cm thick, that corresponds to a volume for cooked quinoa of roughly 200-230 ml (since it also settles around the vegetables). Cooked quinoa is dense and weighs about 120 grams per 100 ml (or around 120g per 2/3 cup). Considering the visible quantity looks a little less than 2 standard Swiss cooked rice portions (one is 150g), I estimate the weight to be between 160 and 200 grams. Judging from the fullness and layering, I will select a final estimate of 180 grams."
p96w4a,gâteau au fromage blanc,62.0,90,28.0,0.20387551379917793,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/94d47a3d-d621-4678-8108-0e196b8af271,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I need to visually identify the 'gâteau au fromage blanc', which is the cheesecake-like slice on the upper portion of the plate. I observe that the slice is a standard wedge, roughly 1/8th to 1/10th of a round cake, with moderate thickness. The piece is about 4.5-5 cm along the crust edge, and around 2-3 cm thick. Given the plate’s known size (Swiss plate, likely about 22-24 cm diameter), this wedge occupies a modest area, suggesting a small to medium Swiss portion. From density considerations, cheesecake (fromage blanc-based) is moist and denser than a sponge cake but lighter than a baked cheesecake. In Swiss context, small slices from an average 22 cm cake weigh about 70–110g. Given the visible slice size, thickness, and lack of heavy crust, this is not an oversized serving. To calibrate: minimum for such a slice is 70g (very thin), maximum 110g (thicker, taller slice). This appears close to the mid-range; to reflect the visual evidence I estimate the portion at 90 grams."
wrah5h,caviar d'aubergines,69.0,42,27.0,0.2187903699354081,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/69327bb9-2361-4486-bea2-300691e60d0a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I visually identify the caviar d'aubergines, which is the chunky spread on top of the bread, looking creamy and like mashed eggplant with some texture. The entire amount is on a single slice of rustic bread, and none appears hidden. For dimension analysis, the spread covers most of the surface of the bread, reaching close to the edges, and appears to be applied in a relatively thick layer—about 1–1.5 cm thick, covering roughly 8x5 cm in area, judging by the average Swiss slice of bread. Using visual reference for spreads of this density (similar to baba ganoush or eggplant dip), the density is moderate—wetter and heavier than hummus but lighter than pâté; about 1g/cm³ is reasonable. Calculating approximate volume (8cm x 5cm x 1cm = 40cm³, slightly mounded so may approach 45-50cm³) yields about 45-50 grams, but spreads tend to flatten out visually, so to avoid overestimation and considering this is a single, moderate portion typical for Switzerland, I select 42 grams as a precise, evidence-based estimate."
p96w4a,tomate,96.0,70,26.0,0.2931297709923664,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/7004d086-abf6-4e9f-a945-0d22f3a60a84,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I locate the 'tomate' in the image, which are the red, chopped pieces throughout the salad. Counting visible tomato pieces, there appear to be roughly 10-12 medium-sized chunks distributed across the top and some are likely underneath. For portion dimension analysis, the tomato chunks collectively fill about 1/3 of the medium bowl, which is a common Swiss salad portion size. Given the bowl's reference size (standard, roughly 12cm diameter), this equates to roughly the yield from half a medium tomato (about 60g) or slightly more. Tomatoes are moderately dense and somewhat juicy, so their apparent volume is close to their true weight. Given these visual cues and the portion calibration, I place the range at 60-80g, and select the upper middle: about 70 grams, since the distribution is quite generous but not filling the bowl entirely."

First, I visually identify the 'pâtes' (pasta) as the penne and fusilli forming the base layer in the bowl, topped with a fresh tomato-based sauce. Next, analyzing the portion: the pasta fills the center of a standard shallow soup/pasta bowl, with its outline visible under the sauce. Pasta is semi-stacked, not completely flat, and there is visible empty space around the heap, suggesting a moderate Swiss portion. In terms of depth, considering the central pile and a slightly thinner edge, I estimate about a double-layer height, appearing roughly as a medium serving. Pasta is a dense, cooked food, usually heavier than it looks, and Swiss portions are typically more conservative than American ones. Comparing with common measured servings (Swiss restaurant or home context for pasta), a visible portion of this size typically weighs 120-140g for a main, less if it's a sidedish. Since the plate is not fully covered and there is considerable open white space, but the pasta is still moderately heaped, I will select a value at the lower-middle end of a standard main portion range. My estimate for the weight of the pâtes is 125 grams."

First, I visually identify the 'filet de canard' on the plate: it consists of two medium-sized slices of duck breast, each with visible skin. They are located at the top center of the plate, darker on top, with a noticeable fat layer. Next, I assess dimensions using the sausage and pasta as size references. Each slice is about 2/3 the length of the sausage (which is about 10-12 cm long), and both slices are thick (around 1.5-2 cm). Individual slices are around 7x4x2 cm and 6x4x2 cm respectively. Duck breast is a dense meat, so the weight per volume is relatively high (comparable to chicken breast, about 1.0-1.1g/cm³, but usually fattier). For both pieces together, visual volume is about 100-110 cm³ (estimating 7x4x2 + 6x4x2 = 56 + 48 = 104 cm³). Assuming 1.05g/cm³, the estimated total weight is around 110g. Considering Swiss/European portion context (not oversized), and the plate arrangement indicates this is a moderate to slightly small serving, so I select a final estimate at the lower-to-mid end of the weight range. Adjusting slightly down for any trimming, my precise estimate is 105 grams."

The target food item is 'œuf au plat' (fried egg). Visually, there are two fried eggs on the plate, each with a clearly defined yolk and a surrounding cooked white. Both eggs are whole, with slight browning around the edges but intact. Comparing their size to the other items on the plate (particularly the beetroot slices and the sardines), each egg appears to be a standard medium-sized Swiss egg. A typical medium fried egg without shell weighs about 50-55 grams. With two eggs, the total would be 100-110 grams. Taking into account the slight loss from browning/crispy edges, I estimate towards the lower end. Therefore, the weight for both œuf au plat is approximately 104 grams."

The target item is 'mousse au chocolat'. Visually, the dessert is a single individual serving presented on a small dessert plate, with a fork next to it for size reference. The mousse is cylindrical, about 6-7 cm in diameter and roughly 4-5 cm in height, with a decorative chocolate piece on top. Comparing to the fork, which is standard dessert size (~16 cm long), the mousse portion is moderate and visually dense, most likely layered with mousse, maybe a thin cake layer at the bottom. Mousse is aerated but still contains significant chocolate and cream, making it denser than just whipped cream. Given Swiss serving sizes (smaller than US), and factoring in the height and diameter, the estimated range is typically 80-120 grams for such patisserie mousse cakes. This one appears to be on the medium side. Cross-validating with standard patisserie data and the visual reference with the fork, a reasonable estimate for the mousse au chocolat is 100 grams."

First, visually identify the 'fromage pate molle.' In the image, we see two distinct cheese portions at the bottom: one is white and appears creamy with a wedge-like structure (which is most likely the 'fromage de chèvre'), while the other piece next to it is softer, irregular, and appears more creamy—this is likely the 'fromage pate molle.' There is one piece of this soft cheese visible. To estimate its weight, I compare its size to the known size of standard cheese wedges and the other items in the container. The container is a typical rectangular lunch box, and the cheese wedge appears to be about 2.5-3 cm wide, 3 cm long, and 1.5-2 cm high. 'Fromage pate molle' (such as Brie or Camembert) is dense but can be slightly lighter due to internal moisture. A piece of this size typically weighs between 18 and 28 grams. Given its compact size and Swiss portion context (smaller than US), I estimate, conservatively, that this specific piece weighs about 22 grams."

First, visually identify the 'saucisse'. It is the single, grilled sausage located on the left side of the plate, next to the duck filets. There is only one sausage, and its size can be compared to the spiral pasta and pieces of duck for scale. The sausage appears to be slightly shorter than the width of the plate's inner circle, and it is of medium thickness. For reference, a typical Swiss grilled sausage of this size (slightly smaller than the typical bratwurst) generally weighs between 40g and 60g, with this specific sausage at the lower end of a standard serving. Taking into account Swiss portion sizes (smaller than US), the sausage appears to weigh around 50g. This takes into account its visible thickness and length, and the fact that it does not look especially large or especially thin."

The target food item is 'boeuf' (beef). On the plate, there are four visually distinct items: a cluster of lettuce (salade), a grilled sausage piece (saucisse), a skewer with grilled chicken (poulet), and a skewer with dark grilled meat, which based on typical dish composition and color, is the beef skewer. For visual identification, the beef skewer is located at the top right, consisting of 4-5 compact grilled chunks. Comparing to the fingers holding the plate, each beef chunk is about the size of a thumbtip, forming a row about 9-10 cm long. Considering the usual density of cooked beef (very dense), and referencing Swiss BBQ skewers which are generally modest in size, each chunk would weigh roughly 12-15 grams. 5 chunks × 13 grams average = 65 grams total. Rechecking visual bulk and considering slight marinade moisture and cut size, 65 grams is well within the standard range for a small Swiss brochette. Therefore, my final estimate is 65 grams."

First, visually identify the 'tartelettes aux chocolats' on the plate: there are two distinct tart halves, one topped with strawberries (tartelettes aux fraises) and one with a dark, glossy chocolate topping and chocolate decorations (tartelettes aux chocolats). Only the chocolate tartlette half is relevant. Assessing portion size, this is not a whole tartelette but precisely half of one, as each tart is cut in two. A standard individual tartelette in Switzerland is usually 7-8 cm in diameter and weighs about 70-80 grams when whole, including pastry shell, ganache, and decorations. This chocolate one appears dense with ganache, nuts/flakes at the edge, and a thick chocolate layer—denser than fruit tarts. Since only half is present, the estimate must be split accordingly. A whole would be in the 75 g range, so half would be 37.5-40 g, but the chocolate layer is substantial, and some edge decorations increase density. Adjusting slightly upward within the plausible half-range, the best estimate for the visible tartelette aux chocolats half is 40 grams."

First, I visually identify the 'chips' in the image: these are light, airy animal-shaped chips (commonly puffed or extruded crisps), served in a small white bowl. I count roughly 18-22 pieces visible, noting that some chips overlay others, but the pile is not particularly deep. Compared to the bowl size (which is a small to medium bowl, likely 12-14 cm in diameter, typical for a single snack portion in Switzerland), the chips fill the bottom in one layer, with minimal overlapping. Considering their type and density: puffed chips are very light and voluminous, weighing very little per piece (typical serving for shaped puffed chips fills a small bowl like this is about 8-12g). Calibrating for Swiss portion context (on the smaller side), these portions rarely exceed 10 grams for a home snack. Cross-validating, the typical weight for a similar visible quantity in such a bowl is 8-12g. I select a middle estimate, favoring accuracy for volume and density."

First, I locate the 'croissants au jambon' on the plate. There are two small croissants, clearly distinct from the other items, and they appear to be miniature, likely appetizer-sized, not full-size bakery croissants. Next, I compare their size to the other foods and the knife for reference: each is about the size of a golf ball, and noticeably smaller than a standard croissant. Judging by the volume and considering that they contain both pastry and ham (which is denser than the pastry alone), each mini croissant likely weighs approximately 25-30g. Since there are two, the combined weight range would be 50-60g. These are Swiss-size portions (not oversized), so I select a balanced estimate for both: 27g each × 2 = 54g total. Thus, my final estimation for the 'croissants au jambon' is 54 grams."

Step 1: Visual identification. The image shows two slices of bread ('pain'), each cut from a baguette or similar loaf and spread with chocolate spread. Both slices are fully visible and appear to be the lengthwise halves of a medium piece of baguette. Step 2: Dimension analysis. Each slice is around 15-17 cm long and 4-5 cm at its widest, with visible crumb thickness suggesting a cut of about 2-2.5 cm thick. Step 3: Density considerations. French baguette is lighter than sandwich bread but still dense, with a light airy texture inside. Standard density is about 60 g for a portion this size per slice. Step 4: Portion size calibration. For two halves (equivalent to one cut piece from a section of baguette, not a full-length baguette portion), the total weight should be in the range of 45-65 g depending on the loaf. Swiss portions tend to be on the smaller side. Given the airiness of the crumb and their medium cut, these two halves likely total to around 55 g. Step 5: Cross-validation. This is a common size for a half baguette serving in Switzerland and is reasonable as the slices do not appear especially thick or large."

The target food is 'céréales'. The image shows a small to medium-sized bowl containing cereals mixed with milk. To visually identify only the cereals, I note the following: the cereals are granola-type clusters and flakes, partially submerged in milk, covering the entire surface of the milk but forming only a single, thin layer. The bowl appears to be roughly 12-14 cm in diameter and there is just enough cereal to slightly rise above the milk in a sparse-to-moderate scattering. Typically, a Swiss portion for such a breakfast is conservative, and the visual evidence suggests much less than a full bowl (no significant depth or heaping). For density, cereals like these are fairly light, and the visible amount is consistent with a small handful. A standard weight for a small, non-heaped serving of cereal is around 25-30g. Given the visible surface coverage and the limited depth, I estimate the total cereal content at the lower end of this range. I also avoid overestimation by not including the milk or accounting for any hidden bulk (none visible)."

First, I will visually identify the confiture de coing (quince jam) on the bread. Both slices clearly have a visible yellowish, translucent jelly layer spread on top. To assess the amount, I note that the jam is not evenly spread but appears in generous dollops rather than a thin layer; some areas are thicker. Now, regarding the dimensions: each bread slice is approximately 10-12cm long which is typical for Swiss bread, and both slices are nearly fully covered with jam on the upper surface. Comparing to the known area of a slice of rustic bread and considering the thickness of the jam (an average of 2mm, slightly chunkier and prominent in some places), I estimate each slice has around 15-18g of jam. Together, this results in a total range of 30-36g. Given the portion size is moderate and not too thick, I select the value towards the median, so the final estimate for confiture de coing is 33 grams."

First, I locate the target food item: 'myrtilles' (blueberries). In the image, the blueberries are grouped at the bottom right of the plate, next to the raspberries. Counting carefully, I see 5 distinct blueberries. For visual estimation, I compare their size to the raspberries, which are slightly larger. These appear to be standard-size blueberries (roughly 1-1.5cm in diameter). In terms of average raw weight, a single blueberry typically weighs about 1.5–2 grams. Given these are medium-sized and look plump, I'll use the higher end of 2 grams per berry. 5 blueberries × 2g each = 10g. Adjusting for possible variation in moisture and slight size difference, but being conservative, I estimate the weight of the blueberries (myrtilles) to be 10 grams."

First, I need to visually identify the 'gâche' in the image. Gâche is a type of brioche-like bread, and in this image, there are two slices on the table, each with chocolate spread ('pâte à tartiner au chocolat') on top. Only the bread is being estimated, not the spread. Step 1: There are 2 slices present. Step 2: For dimension analysis, each slice is roughly square shaped and appears slightly thicker than regular toast, about the size of a typical palm. Based on the nearby glass and keys for reference, each slice seems to be about 11x11 cm and about 1.5-2 cm thick. Step 3: Gâche is quite dense and buttery, similar to brioche, so it will be heavier than standard white toast. A typical thick brioche slice of this size weighs about 35-40 grams per slice in Swiss context (smaller than some French or US versions, but still substantial). Step 4: There are two slices, both appear full-sized, so that's 35-40g per slice x 2 = 70-80g. Step 5: Double-checking for hidden food or underestimated thickness, the slices are not extremely thick, so the estimate should stay mid-range. Therefore, the estimated weight for the gâche (bread only, both slices) is about 76 grams."

First, I visually locate the orange: it consists of three peeled segments arranged centrally on the plate. Each segment is of medium size, typical of a Swiss orange (smaller than US varieties), and they are all intact with no visible loss of flesh. For dimension analysis, I compare the orange pieces to the plate and nearby fruits. Each segment appears to be approximately 1/8 of a medium orange, so three segments is roughly 3/8 of a whole orange. The density of orange segments is moderate, and they look fresh and juicy. A whole medium orange (Swiss context) generally weighs around 130-140g peeled, so 3/8 of this would be about 49-53g. Cross-checking with the visible flesh volume and comparing to the apple and kiwi, these segments are not unusually thick or small, supporting a typical proportionate estimate. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of orange present to be 52 grams."

First, I visually identify the target food as a single chocolate chip cookie. The cookie is photographed alone on a countertop, with none of it hidden or broken off. For dimension analysis, I note the cookie appears homemade and is relatively thick with a rough, craggy texture. Compared to the granite background, it appears to be about 8-10 cm in diameter and about 1.5-2 cm thick, suggesting a substantial volume. In terms of density, cookies are relatively dense due to their ingredients (flour, butter, sugar, chocolate), especially thick ones like this. For portion calibration, Swiss portions are often a bit smaller, but this cookie looks like a typical bakery-style American cookie, not a miniature; nevertheless, it doesn't look oversized. Based on standard weights of similar thick chocolate chunk cookies, which generally range 45-70 grams depending on exact size and thickness, and factoring in this one's medium-to-large size for a single, I estimate its weight at 60 grams."

The target food item is 'pâte à tartiner au chocolat', i.e., chocolate spread. First, I locate the chocolate spread: it is visible on top of three slices of butter braid bread (tresse au beurre), fully spread in a thick but not excessive layer. I need to ignore the bread and estimate only the chocolate spread. Step 1: There are three slices, each with a fairly even and moderately thick layer of spread. Step 2: Each slice appears to be roughly 11 x 5 cm in size, and the spread covers almost the whole surface of each. The thickness seems to be about 1.5-2 mm, thicker in some spots, but not an excessive pile-up. Step 3: Chocolate spread is dense; typically, 'pâte à tartiner' weighs about 5-8g per thinly spread toast (10g median), or higher with thicker application. Given the generous but not extreme layer, a Swiss context, and careful upper-bound avoidance, I estimate closer to 11g per slice. Step 4: 3 slices x 11g = 33g total. Step 5: Verify – does 33g of Nutella or similar look like this? Yes: typical serving visual guides suggest this is realistic for moderate, visible but not over-thick spreads on 3 mid-size slices. Therefore, the estimated weight of the chocolate spread is 33 grams."

First, I identify the mozzarella: it is located in the upper section of the rectangular container and is cut into irregular chunks. Step 1: Visual identification shows about 7-8 medium to large chunks, stacked closely. Step 2: Comparing their size to the tomato slices and the container (which appears to be a standard Swiss single-portion meal box, roughly 15 x 10 cm), each piece looks to be about 3-5 cm wide and 1.5-2 cm thick on average. Arranged together, the mozzarella occupies roughly one third of the container area, with some height. Step 3: Mozzarella is a dense, moist cheese and typically quite heavy for its volume (approx. 120-130g per half ball or 125g per ball). Step 4: Visually, the quantity here does not make up a full ball and seems slightly less than a standard 125g portion, probably closer to half to three-quarters of a standard mozzarella ball. Estimating a range: minimum 60g (if some is hidden or pieces are flat), maximum 90g (if the chunks are piled and thicker), with the visible evidence matching the medium portion around 75g. Step 5: Double-checking, the amount of mozzarella here would be typical for a small salad or bowl portion. Therefore, my final estimate is 75 grams."

The image shows a single peeled carrot ('carotte pelée') placed on a countertop. First, I visually confirm that there is only one carrot and it is fully peeled, with no visible green top or root. Comparing its size to the typical texture and background granularity of the counter, the carrot appears to be of average length (roughly 14-16 cm) and moderately thick (around 3 cm in diameter at its thickest point). Peeled carrots lose only a small part of their weight compared to whole carrots. For Swiss portions, carrots are typically smaller than those seen in the US. The density of a raw carrot is fairly high (~0.9-1g/cm³). For this size, standard Swiss peeled carrots would weigh between 90 and 120 grams. Given the visible size, this carrot fits the profile of a medium portion, so I estimate its weight to be 105 grams."

First, I locate the 'œuf' (egg) on the plate. The image clearly shows one fried egg at the bottom of the plate, with an intact yolk and a fairly standard white spread. Visually, it does not appear to be an unusually large or small egg and is cooked in a typical way. Comparing it to the potato cubes and zucchini slices, the egg appears to be a typical medium egg – Swiss medium eggs generally weigh around 53-60g raw including the shell. When fried, the water loss is minor, and no shell is included, so the net edible weight for a fried medium egg is approximately 48-52g. This egg does not appear to be missing significant portions and there are no indications of an atypical thickness or double yolk. In Swiss portion context, it fits the average home-cooked size. Thus, the best estimate based on appearance and reference is 50 grams."

First, I visually identify the 'brownies chocolat noir noix' as a single piece of brownie on a yellow napkin. There are visible pieces of walnut embedded, and the brownie is intact aside from some crumbs. For dimensions, the brownie appears rectangular, roughly the size of a typical Swiss-cut homemade piece, about 5-6 cm in length, 4-5 cm in width, and around 2-2.5 cm in height. Brownies are dense due to a high content of chocolate, butter, and nuts, so the apparent volume likely underestimates the actual weight. For a piece of this size, and using the Swiss context (smaller portions), a dense brownie this size typically weighs between 50 and 70 grams. Given its thickness and visible density, I will select the middle-upper end of the range but remain conservative: 63 grams."

First, I visually identify the 'asperges' (asparagus) in the image. There are several clear pieces of green asparagus mixed into the rice salad, distinguishable by their color and typical long, slender shape. Counting methodically, there are about 4 to 5 visible segments, each around 4-6 cm in length, and some pieces may be partially hidden under the rice. Asparagus is denser than leafy greens but still relatively light and absorbs some water during cooking; each visible segment could weigh about 7-10 grams. Considering their size and possible hidden portions, the total bulk of asparagus on the plate seems to comprise a small handful. For a salad portion of this type, and given the Swiss context (not overly large), I'd estimate a range of about 25-40 grams. Since asparagus is distributed across the dish, and accounting for potential hidden segments, I will select 33 grams as a visually justified, conservative medium estimate."

First, identify the target food: 'salade' (salad). The salad is clearly visible on the left side of the plate, consisting of loose green lettuce leaves, with possible seeds or a light vinaigrette. Count the visible volume: this is a single-layer pile, loose, taking up about a third of a dinner plate. Compare to the plate (medium–large, Swiss standard): the salad portion covers an area roughly the size of a cupped adult hand or a fist. Assess depth and hidden volume: the layer is fluffy, but not deeply piled and not compressed. Lettuce is very light and voluminous; 1 packed cup of loose leaf lettuce is about 20-25g, but a loose handful/fluffy serving can be less. This serving Looks to be about 1.5-2 loose cups, but not packed or tightly compacted, and there is some dressing visible adding a bit of weight. Portion size calibration: typical Swiss side salad is often 30–50g visually; this is a medium portion closer to 40g. Cross-validate: weight seems appropriate for the fluffy, loose serving (avoid underestimating by remembering density is mostly water, but portion here is not large). Final estimated weight: 40 grams."

The image shows a single feuilleté sauce tomate (puff pastry with tomato sauce) on a wooden surface. Step 1: Visual identification – there is only one piece, clearly visible, with no other items or partial pieces present. Step 2: Dimension analysis – based on the wood grain and the apparent size of the pastry, it looks small, typical of an appetizer or apéritif feuilleté; likely about 4-5 cm in length and about 2-3 cm in diameter. The pastry appears puffy but not very thick through the center. Step 3: Density considerations – puff pastry is light and airy, but the addition of tomato sauce adds a bit of weight. Such a feuilleté is less dense than bread, more dense than chips. Step 4: Portion size calibration – a standard Swiss apéritif feuilleté of this size generally weighs between 11 and 16 grams (based on bakery listings and comparative context); this one leans on the smaller side, so I select towards the middle-lower end. Step 5: Cross-validation – there's only one piece, visible in full, and no significant hidden volume. This looks right for a single, small, tomato-filled feuilleté. Therefore, I estimate the weight at 13 grams."

First, visually identify the 'pain' (bread) on the plate: it is located at the bottom center of the image and appears as a single chunk of a baguette (French bread). In terms of dimensions, the piece is roughly the size of two large bites, corresponding to about a 5-6 cm segment of a typical Swiss baguette, with part of the interior crumb exposed. Swiss baguette is known for being slightly smaller/lighter than standard French baguette. Comparing with the avocado and plate size for scale, this matches about 1/7 or 1/8 of a standard baguette. Densely packed interior, crusty outside, it's a medium-density carb food. Standard weight for a full (Swiss) baguette is around 250g; thus, this chunk would weigh between 30g (very small) and 45g (larger chunk). Given the size and airiness, and referencing the portion trends in Switzerland, I estimate the weight of this chunk of bread to be 37 grams."

Lettuce is very light and airy, often leading to overestimation if one judges only by volume. Comparing the bowl to the nearby tortilla wrap, it is a standard single-serving salad bowl. In the Swiss context, a typical serving of green salad in such a bowl is between 30g (light) and 60g (very full and compressed); this looks solid but not pressed down tightly. Taking into account the visible depth, moderate packing, and the natural bulkiness of lettuce, the most reasonable estimate for this portion is around 45 grams."

The target food item is 'fraises' (strawberries). Step 1: Visual Identification – The bowl contains several pieces of strawberries that have been cut, likely into halves or quarters. There is no other food visible, only strawberries and no sugar visible. Step 2: Dimension Analysis – The bowl appears to be medium-sized (about 15cm diameter), and the strawberries fill the bottom layer with some overlapping and stacking in the center. The pieces cover most of the base and form a shallow mound, suggesting a modest but not small portion. Comparing with the bowl size and typical strawberry pieces, the total volume seems equivalent to about 8-10 medium strawberries. Step 3: Density Considerations – Strawberries are less dense than cooked grains but have significant water weight. One medium strawberry (whole) typically weighs about 12-15g. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration – Estimating at 8-10 whole strawberries gives a range of 96g (8x12g) to 150g (10x15g). Given that the bowl is not mounded high and using Swiss portion logic (slightly smaller standard), it's reasonable to select a moderate figure near the middle of this range. Step 5: Cross-Validation – The portion looks substantial but not excessive, and the estimate should err on the visually grounded side. Therefore, the weight of the fraises is estimated to be 125 grams."

The specified item is 'yaourt nature'. In the image, there is one plastic yogurt pot, fully filled, placed next to an apple for scale. The standard Swiss yogurt pot commonly holds 125 grams of yogurt, which aligns with the visual evidence: the pot is filled nearly to the top with no indication of missing product. There are no extra toppings or mix-ins, just plain yogurt. I will not include the weight of the container. This is a classic processed food portion, and the visual matches the standard single-serve plain yogurt pot size of 125 grams."

The image shows two whole strawberries ('fraise') lying on a wooden surface. Each strawberry appears to be of small to medium size, as is typical for Swiss portions, and there are no reference items for exact scaling, but their proportions suggest a smaller variety, possibly 3-4 cm long each. A typical small-medium strawberry weighs about 12-15 grams. For two strawberries of this size, the combined weight is likely between 24 and 30 grams. Given that these do not appear unusually large, I estimate towards the lower-middle end for accuracy and conservativeness."

First, visually identify the 'brochette de boeuf' on the plate: it is the skewer with three pieces of grilled beef located at the top of the plate. Counting the visible pieces, there are clearly three fairly large, cube-shaped pieces on the skewer. Comparing these to the slice of baguette and the mergez sausage on the same plate, each beef cube is about 3 cm per side and looks dense and cooked through (not overly shrunk by cooking). For beef, a cube of 3x3x3 cm weighs approximately 25-30 grams due to its high density. With three such pieces, the total estimated raw weight would be about 75-90 grams, but as it is cooked, some water content is lost. In Swiss portion context (typically conservative), and based on visual volume confirmation, I estimate each cube at about 23 grams (total 69 grams), slightly adjusting downwards to account for the cooking shrinkage which makes them denser. Therefore, the best estimation for the 'brochette de boeuf' is 69 grams."

First, I locate the 'sauce oignons' on the image. The sauce consists of visible cooked onions layered on top of the slice of roast ('rôti'), with a reddish-brown color and slightly glossy appearance. It sits mainly on top of the meat and a little to the side, without spreading much onto the plate or salads. For dimension analysis, the onions cover an area approximately corresponding to the size of two stacked Swiss franc coins, with a moderate thickness (about 1-2 cm), and are visibly piled up, indicating some depth. The density of cooked onions is moderate: they retain some volume and moisture, but lose a significant amount of mass when cooked. As sauce, the onion component is generally heavier than it looks for its volume. I estimate the total visible sauce to be between 18 and 28 grams. Given this is a typical Swiss portion, and the sauce is limited, I select a mid-range value, accounting for both the onions and the saucy part. My estimate for the onion sauce ('sauce oignons') is 23 grams."

Step 2: Count – There are 5 individual Blévita crackers visibly stacked. Step 3: Dimension Analysis – Each cracker appears to be of standard Blévita size: approximately 6 cm x 4 cm, and about 2 mm thick. Step 4: Density & Reference – Blévita crackers are fairly dense for their size. A standard Blévita graines de courges cracker weighs about 6.5 grams (Swiss standard product), and this estimation fits the shape and thickness seen. Step 5: Multiply – 5 crackers × 6.5 grams each = 32.5 grams total. Round slightly to account for potential crumb loss or minor size variations. Therefore, the estimated total weight is 33 grams."

First, I identify the 'crème de marrons' as the glossy brown spread on top of the bread. Visually, it evenly covers the upper surface of two small slices of rustic bread. The layer appears relatively thin but is not transparent, indicating a true spread rather than a light smear. Next, I compare the slices with standard bread dimensions for the Swiss context—the slice size is about half a regular tartine (likely 6-7 cm wide each). Estimating coverage area to be about 12 x 7 cm total, and the spread thickness about 2 mm. Crème de marrons is dense, about 1.1 g/cm³. Calculating the approximate volume: 12 cm x 7 cm x 0.2 cm = 16.8 cm³. Multiplying by density gives about 18.5 grams. Considering possible uneven spread and slight excess on the edges, the total is likely between 15-22 grams. For this medium portion, my best estimate is 19 grams."

First, I will locate the 'fraise' (strawberries) in the image. The strawberries are cut into slices and are placed in a visible layer at the bottom and sides of the bowl under the vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. I estimate there are approximately 12-16 visible strawberry slices, and likely more slices hidden beneath the ice cream scoop. Each slice corresponds to about a half or a third of a medium strawberry, and given the density and visual space they occupy (covering the base of a small dessert bowl 1 to 2 layers thick), I estimate there to be about 6-8 whole strawberries in total. A medium Swiss strawberry weighs about 12-15 grams, so for 7 strawberries, this yields 84-105 grams. Adjusting for sliced presentation, layering, and possible slight overestimation of depth, I conservatively estimate the total weight of the strawberries (fraise) as 92 grams."

First, I need to locate the 'sauce à salade' (salad dressing) in the image. The plate shows a mixed cold rice salad with various ingredients. The salad appears lightly coated, with a slight sheen on many ingredients, suggesting that a vinaigrette or light oil-based dressing has been distributed over the whole salad. There is no visible pool of dressing nor dense accumulation, and the salad does not look heavily dressed but rather lightly coated, which is typical in Swiss salads. Considering the total volume of salad on the plate (roughly filling most of a standard dinner plate, which usually holds around 350-400g of mixed food) and given that salad dressings are generally added at about 1 to 2 tablespoons per plate (15-30g), and this one appears on the lighter side, I estimate the weight of the visible salad dressing coating the whole plate to be about 18 grams."

First, visually identify the 'tomate' in the image: it is the pile of sliced fresh tomato placed to the right side of the glass container. Let's count the slices: there are 5 fully visible slices, and one partial (at the bottom). Each slice appears fairly thick and uniform. Comparing the slices to the size of the grains of blé and the container itself (this looks like a Swiss-style square glass lunch box, approximately 12x12 cm), the tomato slices seem to come from a medium-sized tomato. The tomato pieces are stacked closely together, with the visible volume suggesting about one whole tomato (not a large one). A typical medium Swiss tomato weighs between 90g and 110g when whole. Adjusting slightly downward for the core cut out (which is missing), the total visible edible slices are likely in the 85g to 100g range. Based on the compactness and thickness of each slice, and the overall portion size seen, I estimate the weight of the tomato slices to be 95 grams."

Step 1: Visual identification. The target food item is 'noix de cajou' (cashew nuts), which are clearly visible in the palm of a hand. Step 2: Dimension analysis. I observe 12 individual cashew nuts in the hand. Each cashew nut appears to be of average size; cashews typically weigh about 1.2-1.5 grams per nut. The hand size suggests these are standard cashews, not jumbo. Step 3: Density considerations. Cashews are a dense, processed nut, so their size corresponds closely to their weight — no fluff or air gaps. Step 4: Portion size calibration. With 12 pieces, multiplying the average individual weight (assuming 1.3 grams per nut for a Swiss portion) gives a range of 14.4 to 18 grams. For this moderately filled handful, I select a midpoint: 16 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation. The quantity matches a typical small Swiss handful snack portion, and the estimation aligns with visual evidence and density."

First, I identify the haricots rouges (red kidney beans) on the plate—they are on the left side of the image, distinctively dark red and oval-shaped. The portion occupies roughly a quarter of the plate and is arranged in a small mound. Using the fork and pasta as size references, the visible quantity appears to be a moderate single Swiss portion, not heaped. Cooked red beans are dense and can be underestimated in weight; a standard serving size is often about 80-120g in Swiss contexts. Given the coverage, mound height, and moderate density, I estimate the beans to be toward the middle of this range, about 95 grams."

The target food is 'pâte à tartiner au chocolat.' Visually, the image shows two slices of pain au céréales, each spread with a layer of chocolate spread. Step 1: Identification—the chocolate spread is visible across the entire surface of both slices, more concentrated in some areas but not excessively thick overall. Step 2: For dimension, each slice is about the length of a typical Swiss demi-baguette wedge, approximately 15–18cm each and 4–5cm wide at their widest. The spread appears as a moderate, uneven layer, not piled up, following the bread's surface texture, and filling many of the air holes but not overflowing them. Step 3: Density—chocolate spreads are dense; a thin layer can add up quickly in weight. Step 4: Portion calibration—estimating coverage, the amount spread looks to be roughly 3–4g per slice for a conservative thin layer, but with some areas thicker, so the average is likely a bit higher—let's say 6–8g per slice. Both slices together likely have around 14–16g of spread. To cross-validate, a typical breakfast serving is 10–15g for two pieces at this thickness. I will refine my estimate to 15 grams for the visible pâte à tartiner au chocolat."

First, I need to locate the parmesan in the image. The parmesan is sprinkled on top of the spaghetti on the left side of the plate. The parmesan is a grated cheese with a fine texture, spread mainly in the center of the pasta. Step 2: For dimension analysis, I observe that the mound of parmesan is not overly thick but forms a clearly visible layer, mostly concentrated in the center (not much spread to the plate's edges), with a few scattered shavings. Comparing it to the standard size of the spaghetti mound and noting the concentration, the quantity looks like the result of a standard tablespoon sprinkle, reaching about a 5-6 cm diameter area and a thin layer. Step 3: Parmesan is a dense food; despite its light appearance when grated, the actual weight adds up quickly. Step 4: Portion size calibration: In a Swiss context, cheese is usually used conservatively; this portion would classify as a moderate sprinkle, not an overloaded one. Cross-validation: Common underestimation of grated cheese happens because it looks light and fluffy; however, the density is high. Standard grated parmesan servings in Switzerland are around 5-10g for a moderate layer. Given this portion looks like a single, generous sprinkle, the best estimate is 7 grams."

First, I visually identify the 'graine de tournesol' (sunflower seeds) on the image. These seeds are sprinkled predominantly over the green salad portion of the plate, distributed in a scattered but not overly thick layer. There appear to be some concentrated clusters and a lighter scattering elsewhere. For dimension analysis, the sunflower seeds are small, around 1-1.5 cm in length each; there are many visible, but none piled very thickly, and the actual coverage across the salad suggests a modest handful. Comparing to the size of the egg and the salad leaves, the serving looks like a typical sprinkle for texture, not a bulk topping. In density considerations, sunflower seeds are dense (similar to nuts), so a small amount by volume is heavier than it appears. A standard Swiss portion, when sprinkled on a salad as this, usually ranges from 10 to 20 grams. Visually, this looks like a small handful — not overly generous. For calibration, I'd classify this as a small-to-medium portion based on the sparse coverage and comparing with typical restaurant salads. Cross-validating, I note that people sometimes underestimate small seeds, but in this case, the layer is visibly thin and doesn't build up to a pile. Given all of this, the best estimate for the visible portion is 13 grams."

Step 1: Visually identifying the oignons nouveaux (spring onions), I see thin, white and light green round slices sprinkled on the tomato and mozzarella section of the plate, with a few more possibly scattered over the salad. Step 2: There are about 8-10 small rings visible on the left half of the plate, with no significant bulk elsewhere. Each slice looks roughly 2-3mm thick, and there is no large visible chunk remaining—no big portion of whole stalks. Step 3: Spring onions are very light in weight due to high water content and low density. These visible slices likely come from less than a full stalk, possibly just from the white and light green portion; the dark green leafy part, which could add extra weight, does not appear present here. Step 4: For Swiss context, a single full spring onion (including green part) is about 12-15g; here, the total sliced amount visible corresponds visually to about 1/3 of a stalk, possibly less, and only the white and light green part. That would be around 4-5g at most. Step 5: For cross-validation: it's common to overestimate the weight of such garnish portions, but here all slices are visible; volume is thin, and density is low. Final estimate: 4 grams."

First, I visually identify the target food: 'gyozas végétariens (3 pièces)'. In the image, there are exactly three visible vegetarian gyozas arranged on a standard-sized plate. Each gyoza appears to be medium-sized, with a typical 'crescent' shape, and they look well-filled but not overly large. Based on the plate as a reference (which is standard dinner plate size), the gyozas seem to be about 7-8 cm each in length and roughly 2.5-3 cm thick at the thickest point. Vegetarian gyozas are typically less dense than meat versions, but still substantial due to vegetable filling and dough. The average weight for one standard vegetarian gyoza (Swiss/European portion size) is generally 18-22g. With three gyozas and considering they do not appear oversized or unusually small, I estimate the total weight as 20g x 3 = 60g. This is consistent with known portion sizes and the visual evidence, and ensures I'm not underestimating the filling or overcounting dough weight. Therefore, my final estimate is 60 grams for the three vegetarian gyozas."

First, I locate fromage (etivaz) on the plate. Among the cheeses, Etivaz is a hard Swiss cheese almost always cut in a rectangular stick or block shape. On the plate, in the top left next to the bread is a rectangular, pale yellow wedge: this visually matches how Etivaz is typically served. The slice is about 8–9 cm long, 1.5 cm wide, and about 1 cm thick, based on comparison with the size of the bread and the fork/knife in the background. Dense cheese like Etivaz is about 1.1 g/cm³, so I calculate the volume: 9 cm × 1.5 cm × 1 cm = 13.5 cm³, yielding approximately 15 grams (considering possible rounding on the thickness, which might reach 1.2 cm at the thick end). Given that this is a classic Swiss portion and not oversized, I select a weight near the middle of a 12–17g range, so the best estimate is 15 grams."

Step 1: The target food is 'churros.' In the image, there are two churros visible on a dark background. Both churros appear to be of standard length, neither broken nor missing visible pieces. Step 2: For dimension analysis, each churro is roughly the length of a standard utensil (probably around 15-18 cm), and each is about 1.5-2 cm in diameter. There are no reference objects in the image, but visually, they seem to align with typical Swiss/European churros, which are generally thinner and slightly shorter than typical US fair churros. Step 3: Considering density, churros are fried dough pastry, not heavy like bread, but definitely denser than something like a puff pastry. Step 4: A standard thin churro of this size typically weighs about 18-22 grams each; given these two look standard in both length and diameter (not extra-large, not mini), I'd set the range for one churro from 18g to 22g. Two churros together: 36g to 44g. Both look similar in size. Step 5: Cross-validation - visually this matches the Swiss portion context, and there is no hidden depth or layering, so no under- or over-estimation errors. Selecting a midpoint estimate given no unusual features and a standard portion, I estimate the total weight of the visible churros to be 40 grams."

First, I locate the target food 'pâtes' (pasta) in the image. The pasta is on the right half of the meal box, topped with tomato sauce and a generous layer of grated Parmesan. Visually, the pasta portion appears to fill about half of a standard metal bento lunch box. Using the visible spirals (fusilli), I can see that the layer is not just superficial; it appears to be about 2-3 cm deep and densely packed. Comparing the size of the pasta portion to the other items (chicken fillets and green beans), this looks like a substantial but not oversized serving, appropriate for a Swiss portion (smaller than US sizes). For a packed lunch, such a volume is typically 130-170g cooked weight. Given the fullness and accounting for a small reduction from the added sauce and cheese volume, I estimate the pasta alone to be at the mid-high end of that range. Therefore, my estimate for the cooked pasta in the image is 150 grams."

The target food item is 'cornet glace noisette' (hazelnut ice cream cone). Step 1: Visually, the image shows a hand holding a classic waffle cone with a single scoop of hazelnut ice cream. Step 2: Comparing the scoop size to the fingers, the ice cream occupies the top of the cone and forms a single rounded ball of approximately 5-6 cm in diameter. The cone is of standard Swiss portion size, not oversized. Step 3: For density, ice cream is semi-dense (heavier than whipped foods, lighter than water); standard single scoop is about 60-70g, and a typical restaurant waffle cone is about 15g. Step 4: Portion size calibration—this is clearly a small/medium Swiss-style serving. Adding the scoop of ice cream (about 65g) plus cone (15g), avoiding adding any container or wrapper weight. Step 5: Cross-validation—nothing is hidden from view, and the estimate stays within standard Swiss servings, no visual evidence for under/overestimation. Therefore, the estimated total weight for 'cornet glace noisette' (scoop plus cone) is 80 grams."

First, I locate the parmesan on the plate. The parmesan is the whitish, grated powdery portion located in the center of the plate, between the scrambled eggs and the tomato slices. It appears as a loose, fluffy mound, and is lighter in color and finer in texture than the eggs. For dimension analysis, the pile of parmesan is relatively small on the plate, about the size of a large tablespoon (or roughly the palm of a small hand), and is considerably smaller than the egg or vegetable portions. Grated parmesan is very light and airy, so it occupies more volume per gram than dense foods. For density, grated parmesan cheese is known to weigh about 5 grams per loosely packed tablespoon. The visible portion looks like about 2-2.5 tablespoons, slightly heaped. For portion size calibration, that means a range of about 10-13 grams. Since the mound is on the fluffier side but not overflowing, I'll select the middle of this range for a Swiss context (where portions are conservative). Double-checking, the visual size seems consistent with this range, and there are no other hidden piles of parmesan elsewhere. Thus, I estimate the parmesan at 12 grams."

The image shows a bowl containing a mixture of blanc battu (strained yogurt), flocons d'avoine (oats), chia seeds, and possibly a swirl of honey. Visually, the black chia seeds are dispersed throughout the mixture but not in overwhelming quantity. For seed additions to yogurt mixes in Switzerland, a standard portion is typically one teaspoon (about 4-5g), up to a tablespoon (about 10-12g) for visible texture without dominating the dish. Here, the seeds are visible throughout, suggesting at least a teaspoon, but not so many that the mixture looks heavily packed. Taking into account the volume of the mixture (about 250-300g total in a standard Swiss bowl) and the density of chia seeds (very dense, so even a small amount looks like a lot), the most visually justified estimate is around one heaped teaspoon to a bit more. I estimate the total weight of 'graines de chia' in this bowl to be approximately 6 grams."
ppf8hc,chocolat noir crémant,21.0,20,1.0,0.0024662360540223137,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/8bfe28c5-50fd-4c8b-b169-254186b0524b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two pieces of Cailler 'chocolat noir crémant'. These bars are distinctively shaped, and the Cailler logo is clearly visible, confirming the product. Visually, each segment corresponds to a standard chocolate bar piece from the Cailler 'tablette crémant', which is well-known in Switzerland. A typical Cailler Cremant 100g bar has 10 equally sized pieces, which means one piece is about 10g. There are two pieces in the image, so together they should weigh approximately 20g. The pieces are unbroken, and no additional chocolate is visible outside these two. Since these are dense (solid chocolate) and the Swiss portion is standard (not oversized), the estimate is precise. Therefore, the combined weight of the two pieces is estimated to be 20 grams."
2ahgvr,moutarde,7.0,6,1.0,0.0008220786846741045,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a2d48966-aa71-4479-8b0f-d28dbf8ffab6,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I locate the moutarde (mustard) in the image. This is a challenging visual task as mustard is usually used as a condiment and is likely inside the pita sandwich, not directly visible. However, given the context, the mention of 'pain pita, jambon, moutarde' and visible lettuce, I deduce the mustard would be spread on the inner surface of the pita or on the ham. For visual estimation, I'll consider the proportion typical for a Swiss-style sandwich: a modest squeeze as opposed to a heavy layer. Comparing to the pita's size (approx. 12 cm in diameter), a standard serving of spread mustard inside a sandwich is usually between 5–10g, with Swiss portions on the lower end. The pita is not overflowing, implying a conservative spread. Taking all this into account (mainly hidden, standard thin layer, and Swiss portion context), the weight of moutarde is likely around 6 grams."
2ahgvr,mayonnaise thomy,21.0,22,1.0,0.0024662360540223137,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/b24759a6-90ea-4f9e-a1ad-d52af234de62,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'mayonnaise thomy.' In the image, there is a single dollop of mayonnaise placed at the upper left of the plate, next to the white asparagus. Visually, this dollop appears to be about the size of a heaped tablespoon, which is consistent with a common serving of mayonnaise. Comparing its volume to the asparagus spears—each roughly finger-sized—it looks like a rounded, moderately generous portion but not excessively large. A typical heaped tablespoon of mayonnaise weighs about 20-25 grams. Given the Swiss portion context (smaller portions), and the fact that it doesn't seem overly large, I lean toward a slightly smaller end of this typical range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of 'mayonnaise thomy' in this image to be approximately 22 grams."
2ahgvr,toast,55.0,54,1.0,0.0064591896652965355,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/feb15752-d5e3-4f73-8eeb-9fb560cc6f6b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual identification. The target food item is 'toast', and there are two standard slices of bread, each toasted, visible on the plate. Step 2: Dimension analysis. The toast pieces have a standard size typical for commercial sandwich bread in Switzerland—roughly 10cm x 10cm each, with average thickness, compared to the butter knife for scale. Step 3: Density considerations. Toast loses some moisture compared to fresh bread, but the weight remains close to original; commercial toasted bread slices in Switzerland usually weigh 25-28g each after toasting. Step 4: Portion size calibration. There are two slices—no visible stacking or additional pieces, both entirely visible, suggesting a typical portion size. Step 5: Cross-validation. No part of the toast is hidden, and comparing to the plate/knife confirms the estimation is plausible. Allowing for bread being slightly lighter post-toasting but sticking to Swiss norms, the total estimated weight for both slices is about 54 grams."
ppf8hc,brochettes de poulet,46.0,45,1.0,0.00540223135642983,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/3c9a53ea-be1d-4421-a631-450c4263e07a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, visually identify the 'brochettes de poulet' on the plate. The brochette de poulet is the chicken skewer located above the chips and next to the corn and pepper, with visible grill marks and a moderately thick piece of chicken on a wooden skewer. Step 2: Analyze its size using the standard plate as reference and comparing to neighboring items. The brochette is not particularly large: the chicken portion stretches about two-thirds across the width of the plate, roughly 10-12 cm long, with a width of about 2.5-3 cm and moderate thickness (about 2 cm). Step 3: Chicken is a dense protein, so the pieces may appear smaller than their actual weight. For a skewer this size (closer to a small or medium Swiss portion, less than typical American barbecue size), standard estimates for cooked chicken skewers suggest about 35-45g for a small, 45-60g for a medium, and 60-80g for a large. Accounting for visual evidence and Swiss portion context, I observe this is closer to the lower end of a medium-sized skewer. Step 4: Calibrate portion size – since the skewer is on the smaller side, I select 45g as the most reasonable estimate. Step 5: Final review confirms I have only included the food and not the stick, and have considered the density and all visible chicken. Therefore, my estimate is 45 grams."
6fwmw2,salade de céleri,49.0,50,1.0,0.005754550792718732,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/6fwmw2/dish_media/1a96e805-fc15-4295-90a7-73a41fcb683f,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I need to visually identify the 'salade de céleri' on the plate. There are four distinct food items: the top left is poulet rôti (roast chicken), the bottom left is potato salad (salade de pomme de terre), the top right is shredded carrot salad (salade de carotte), and the bottom right is a small mound of finely shredded, pale root vegetable, which matches the appearance of céleri rémoulade (celery root salad). The celery root salad portion is compact and shaped into a mound about 6cm wide, 5cm deep, and with some height, looking slightly denser than the carrot but fluffier than the potato salad. Celery root salad tends to be moist but not as heavy as potato salad. For a Swiss lunch portion, a scoop that size typically weighs between 40g (small) and 60g (large). Comparing visually with the other items, it is a little less in volume than the potato salad and significantly less than the carrot salad. Based on visual cues, accounting for some depth and density but acknowledging the fluffiness, I estimate the weight at 50 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification. The target food item is 'banane'. In the image, there is a banana cut in half lengthwise and placed on the left side of the plate. Step 2: Dimension Analysis. The banana half takes up almost the entire height of the plate and looks like a typical medium banana split in half. Comparing to standard plates, this half appears to be about 10-12 cm in length and retains the full width of the banana. Step 3: Density Considerations. Bananas are dense fruits, and the skin seems to have been removed so only the edible portion is shown. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration. Since only half of a regular banana is present (with a typical medium banana in Switzerland weighing about 120g), half of that would be around 60g. Step 5: Cross-Validation. The size matches a standard half-banana, and the visual density supports the estimate. No other pieces or hidden portions are present."
8japfq,oeuf au plat,54.0,53,1.0,0.006341749853200235,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/0bd218b2-a4c6-4605-8737-2055d3040f25,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification. The 'oeuf au plat' (fried egg) is clearly visible on the lower right side of the plate, with a distinct yolk and spread-out white. There is one fried egg, fully visible, with the yolk intact, and the white seems to have a natural spread from cooking. Step 2: Dimension Analysis. Comparing to the fork and the brioche, the egg is about standard size for a medium egg when cooked sunny side up—with whites that have spread to a typical diameter on a large plate. The yolk is slightly off center, orangey and well present, the whites take up more space (as usual when cooked). Step 3: Density Considerations. Cooked eggs retain nearly their full raw weight, with only a very minimal water loss from frying. The density of cooked egg is high, and the visual spread matches what is expected for one medium egg. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration. A medium Swiss egg (without shell) weighs about 54-58 grams raw; after frying, the weight slightly decreases, typically to about 50-55 grams due to water loss. The portion here is a standard, single, unbroken egg, so the standard cooked weight range applies. Step 5: Cross-validation. There's no visible portion missing, burning, or unusually thick or thin white/yolk. This is a classic single fried egg, so my estimate is 53 grams, matching the usual post-cooking yield for a medium Swiss egg."

First, identifying the target food item: 'oeufs' (eggs). In the image, there are two whole, peeled hard-boiled eggs clearly visible on the plate. No eggs are cut or missing; both appear to be standard medium-size eggs, consistent with Swiss (not US) portion sizes. Standard medium hard-boiled eggs in Switzerland typically weigh about 53-55 grams each including the yolk and egg white, after peeling. Since there are no shell remnants and both eggs are intact, I will multiply the average weight by two: 2 eggs × 54 grams = 108 grams. This accounts for actual visible egg weight, excluding any non-edible parts."
xjvrtk,poire,200.0,200,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/050419f6-32ae-4276-9993-de18feaccbd1,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single pear ('poire') being held in a hand. Step 1, visual identification: there is only one pear, and it appears whole with skin intact. Step 2, dimension analysis: the pear is fairly large, filling the palm of an adult hand and extending from the base of the fingers to above the hand, which typically suggests a size of about 12-14cm length and approximately 7-8cm at the widest girth. Comparing to the visible hand and reference objects in the background (watch, plate), its girth is consistent with a large, typical European pear. Step 3, density considerations: pears are relatively dense fruits, more so than apples but less dense than bananas, and the skin is included as it's fully visible. Step 4, portion size calibration: the pear looks larger than average for Swiss portions, suggesting a weight toward the upper end of standard pear ranges (usually 140–220g). Step 5, cross-validation: there are no hidden or missing parts of the fruit, and the size fits well with what is typically seen for large Comice or Conférence pears. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this pear to be approximately 200 grams."

First, I locate the séré maigre (Swiss-style low-fat quark/yogurt), which is the white creamy substance visible in the bowl. It is separated clearly from the chopped kiwi pieces. For dimension analysis, the bowl appears to be a small-medium Swiss breakfast bowl. Comparing to the spoon, the séré maigre fills about half the bowl in height and takes up roughly half of the inner surface area (the other half being kiwi). Considering the thickness and density (séré maigre is dense, thicker than yogurt), the visible quantity corresponds to a modest serving. Swiss portions tend to be smaller than U.S. ones. Standard portions for plain quark or yogurt range from 120-180g per bowl; here we have slightly less than a full bowl, approximately half. I visually estimate 60-70% of a typical 150g Swiss bowl, thus ranging about 90-110g. This aligns with the space occupancy and the density observed. Taking the middle of that range, and accounting for the depth of the bowl (not just the surface area), a cautious and evidence-based estimate for the séré maigre is 100 grams."

First, I identify that the target food item is 'chocolat' and there are two small chocolate rabbits visible in the image. Both figures are fully visible and appear solid (not hollow). For size calibration, I use the texture of the table and the visible weave of the placemat at the back to estimate relative size; these figures seem to be around 4 cm tall and 2.5 cm wide each, which matches standard mini solid chocolate bunny confections often seen around Easter. These typically weigh between 10-15g each if solid. Given the density of milk chocolate (which is high, around 1.2-1.3g/cm³), and the non-hollow visual appearance, the total weight is likely closer to 25-30g for both together. Because Swiss portions are modest and these are not oversized, I'll estimate 13g per bunny, yielding 26g in total. This fits the visual cues and density calibration."

Step 1: Visual identification. The image shows a hand holding four round crackers stacked slightly overlapping, making all four clearly visible. Step 2: Dimension analysis. Each cracker is about the size of the palm's width (excluding the thumb), suggesting a typical Swiss-sized round cracker of about 5-6 cm diameter and relatively thin (approx. 3-4 mm). Step 3: Density considerations. Crackers are low-density but not airy; similar products typically weigh between 3-5g each depending on thickness. Step 4: Portion size calibration. With 4 pieces, and comparing their appearance to standard European crackers (like Tuc or table crackers), a conservative estimate would place each around 4g per cracker. This results in a total range of 12g (for very thin) to 20g (for very thick), but visually they appear closer to the middle of this range. Step 5: Cross-validation. Counting is correct (4 crackers), there is no substantial hidden volume, and the hand reference checks out for size. I avoid overcounting and underestimating based on their size and apparent thickness."
