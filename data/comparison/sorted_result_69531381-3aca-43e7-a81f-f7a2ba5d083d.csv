The image shows a pizza with toppings of mushrooms (champignons), olives, and zucchini (courgettes). The pizza is cut into five slices, with four slices visible on the plate. The pizza appears to be a thin-crust type, and the toppings are evenly distributed. Based on the size of the slices and the visible thickness of the crust and toppings, I estimate the total weight of the pizza to be approximately 400 grams. Since four slices are visible and appear to represent about 80% of the pizza, the weight of the visible portion is approximately 320 grams. This includes the crust, cheese, and toppings. The estimation is based on the visual evidence of the pizza's size, thickness, and density."

The poivron (red bell pepper) is visible in the image as thinly sliced pieces placed near the chicken. The slices are relatively thin and spread out, but they appear to be from a single medium-sized bell pepper. Considering the typical weight of a medium bell pepper and the fact that these slices represent only part of the whole pepper, I estimate the weight of the visible poivron slices to be approximately 50 grams."

The jar contains a mixture of ingredients, including chia seeds, which are visible as small black dots distributed throughout the mixture. Chia seeds are dense and small, and their weight can be estimated based on their volume. In this case, the chia seeds appear to be evenly distributed throughout the mixture, suggesting they are a minor component. Given the size of the jar (approximately 250-300 ml capacity) and the typical proportion of chia seeds in such mixtures (around 10-15 grams for a jar of this size), I estimate the weight of the chia seeds to be around 12 grams."
