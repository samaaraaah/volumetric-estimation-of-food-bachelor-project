wrah5h,pâtes,123.0,315.0,192.0,2.911242603550296,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1550c506-8c95-461f-b658-8f427dc2a0af,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'pâtes' (pasta). The pasta is served as fusilli on a standard-sized dinner plate. The plate is about 26-28 cm in diameter based on typical tableware scale and relative size of the fork and knife nearby. The pasta portion occupies roughly one-third of the plate area. Each fusilli piece is about 2.5 cm long and about 0.7 cm in diameter. The pasta appears fully cooked, so it is hydrated and denser than dry pasta. The pasta portion thickness looks about 1.5 to 2 cm, judging by the piled depth and considering the shape of the fusilli. Estimating the volume roughly as an irregular pile covering about 22 cm (length) by 8 cm (width) by 1.8 cm (height) gives approximately 317 cm³ of pasta. Cooked pasta has a density near 1 g/cm³ (close to water). Therefore, the pasta weight estimated from volume is about 315 grams. Cross-checking relative volume compared with the kidney beans and green beans portions, the pasta mass is plausibly higher because pasta is dense and occupies more volume in the plate. Hence, a precise estimate is 315 grams of cooked pasta on the plate."
xjvrtk,tomates cerises,500.0,320.0,180.0,11.094674556213018,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/5ccbcf64-3631-48df-9e8a-85fb33dbf912,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a bunch of cherry tomatoes in a small cardboard container placed on a striped cloth with a book nearby. Each cherry tomato appears to be about 2.5 to 3 cm in diameter; cherry tomatoes typically are small and fairly dense. The cluster contains approximately 18 tomatoes visible. Using the size comparison with the container and the book page width, the tomatoes are dimensionally consistent with normal cherry tomatoes. A single cherry tomato of this size generally weighs about 15-20 grams. Given the freshness and firmness implied by the glossy skin, I'll use 18 grams per tomato as a mid-range estimate. Multiplying 18 tomatoes by 18 grams yields 324 grams total. This volume and weight make sense given the visual packing in the container and relative scale to the book and cloth. Therefore, the estimated total weight of these cherry tomatoes is approximately 320 grams."
xjvrtk,courgette et oignons,300.0,130.0,170.0,6.28698224852071,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'courgette et oignons,' which is the cooked mixture of zucchini and onions visible on the left side of the glass container. The container is a standard rectangular glass meal prep box, which helps give scale. The courgette and onions fill approximately half of the container volume on that side. Looking at the size of the pieces, the courgettes are sliced into medium chunks about 2-3 cm long, mixed with thin slices of onions. The density is moderate since cooked vegetable mixtures like this contain water and some cooking oil but are not dense like grains or patties. The thickness of the layer is roughly equal to the depth of the container, estimated around 3-4 cm. Considering the area it occupies and the overall depth, the volume is roughly 140-160 ml. Considering the density of cooked zucchini and onions, close to 0.8 to 0.9 g/ml, the weight is estimated around 120-140 grams. Cross referencing with the millet patties on the right, which are denser and roughly 40-50 grams each, and there are five patties, total around 200-250 grams, the vegetable mix looks proportionally lighter but substantial in portion. Therefore, a precise estimate is approximately 130 grams for the courgette et oignons portion in the glass container."
2ahgvr,colrave crue,118.0,280.0,162.0,2.356508875739645,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/3718d88c-ba98-4da1-84dc-7d5ad0a4df92,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows peeled and sliced kohlrabi (colrave crue) on a standard rectangular plastic tray lid commonly used for food packaging. The pieces vary in size but generally measure around 4-6 cm in length, 3-4 cm in width, and approximately 1.5-2 cm in thickness. Kohlrabi has a dense, crisp texture, similar to a cabbage or turnip. Evaluating the pieces collectively, there are about 15-18 chunks stacked but spread in a single, moderate layer. The tray is about 20 cm long and 10 cm wide, and the kohlrabi slices cover most of the tray surface with some overlap, suggesting a volume roughly around 400-450 cm³. Given the density of kohlrabi is approximately 0.6-0.7 g/cm³ (lighter than water but denser than leafy greens), multiplying the volume by density yields 240-315 g. Considering the visual fullness and lightweight appearance, an estimate near the middle at 280 g seems reasonable and well supported by volume and density cues."
xjvrtk,épautre cuit,160.0,310.0,150.0,2.9585798816568047,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/02911570-1e99-4b2c-9ad0-469321a8a342,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'épautre cuit' (cooked spelt), which occupies the left side of the container. The container is a rectangular glass dish, approximately 15 cm by 15 cm based on commonly used dish sizes and visual comparison to the food volume. The depth visible suggests the épautre layer is about 2.5 cm thick, slightly less deep than the aubergine slices piled beside it. The spelt grains are loose and not densely packed, appearing as cooked grains with some moisture, which indicates moderate density similar to cooked wheat grains (approximately 1.1 g/cm3). The volume of the cooked spelt can be estimated roughly as 15 cm x 7.5 cm (half the width) x 2.5 cm = 281.25 cm3. Multiplying volume by estimated density 1.1 g/cm3 gives approximately 309 grams. This seems reasonable given the portion size relative to the scrambled eggs and aubergine in the dish. It is consistent with the realistic serving size of cooked grains in a single meal portion seen here. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'épautre cuit' is about 310 grams."
8japfq,"pizza champignons, olives, courgettes",183.0,320.0,137.0,3.0906065088757395,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/9ac9736b-e0d1-4862-9981-1f47f8109d18,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'pizza champignons, olives, courgettes', which is clearly the entire pizza on the plate. The pizza is cut into five uneven slices, with three still mostly intact and two smaller ones. The pizza diameter is approximately the size of the plate, estimated around 24-26 cm based on common plate sizes and the appearance of crust thickness. The crust is moderately thick and well-baked, contributing some weight but not overly dense. The toppings include visible slices of mushrooms, black olives, and courgette slices, distributed evenly but not overly piled. The cheese and sauce layer appears moderately thick, adding some density. Estimating typical cooked pizza dough density and toppings volume: a pizza of this size commonly weighs roughly 250-350 grams. Since the pizza is partially eaten, and all parts on the plate constitute the food item, I estimate the total pizza weight on the plate (which is the entire pizza present) as about 320 grams. This value aligns with the visual volume, density, and size references from the plate and cutlery shadows. Thus, the estimate is precise and plausible given the visible context."
p96w4a,tartine mélasse + beurre,39.0,170.0,131.0,0.6298076923076923,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/c9db26cc-13d6-4355-97a6-2355ea46cf42,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item to estimate is 'tartine mélasse + beurre,' which corresponds to the lower piece of bread on the plate. The slice of bread appears to be a fairly thick, artisanal slice about 12 cm in length and about 5 cm wide at the center, with a visible crumb structure that indicates moderate density. The thickness of the slice is about 2.5 cm, as judged from the crust edge and overall volume. Bread of this type typically weighs about 2.2 grams per cubic centimeter due to its dense crumb and crust. Calculating the volume roughly as a half ellipse (length 12 cm, width 5 cm) times thickness 2.5 cm gives about: 12 * 5 * 2.5 * 0.5 = 75 cubic cm. Multiplying by density (2.2 g/cm3) yields approximately 165 grams for the bread slice alone. The tartine is lightly but evenly spread with butter and molasses. Butter layer, judging by the visible patches and shine, is thin, roughly 2-3 grams. The molasses layer is a light drizzle, also thinly spread, likely about 3 grams. So total spread weight is roughly 5 grams. Adding these, the total estimated weight of the tartine mélasse + beurre is about 170 grams. This estimate is plausible relative to the visual size compared with the tartine confiture fraise + beurre (similar slice size), and the plate size is a standard dessert plate (approx. 20 cm diameter). The volume and weight align well, and no overestimation of thickness or spread density was made."
xjvrtk,"galettes millet, haricots noirs, maïs",200.0,80.0,120.0,2.9585798816568047,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/59e31b5a-2c5c-48e7-b889-58ed408a3a0a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food items are galettes millet, haricots noirs, and maïs, which appear to be combined into the four millet patties visible on the right part of the bowl. Visually, each galette is roughly 6-7 cm in diameter and about 0.7 cm thick (slightly rough texture on the surface suggests density). They appear cooked and browned on the outside but not overly thick. The patties contain visible black beans (haricots noirs) and corn (maïs), which are dense ingredients, contributing to the overall weight. The shape is fairly flat but dense. Comparing the patties to the tomato and onion salad on the left, each patty is clearly a solid, compact piece rather than a loose pile, supporting the density assumption. Given the diameter and thickness, each patty's volume is approximately (using a cylinder approximation) π * (3 cm)^2 * 0.7 cm ≈ 20 cm³. For a moderately dense cooked legume and grain patty, a density near 1 g/cm³ is reasonable, so each patty would be about 20 grams. There are four patties in total, so total weight is about 80 grams. This fits the plate size and portion scale relative to the salad volume. Therefore, the best estimate for the combined weight of the galettes millet, haricots noirs, maïs is 80 grams."
p8a2w5,pillons de poulet,112.0,225.0,113.0,1.5601577909270217,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/bdb25c53-2eb7-4a81-b33e-6d28997d0183,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'pillons de poulet' (chicken drumettes). There are five drumettes visible on the plate. Each drumette is approximately 6-7 cm long and about 3-4 cm wide at the thickest part. Comparing their size to the bread slices on the plate, each piece is smaller than a slice of bread but appears dense and well-cooked. Chicken drumettes typically have a dense muscle mass. By visual volume and recognizing the standard size of such pieces, each likely weighs around 45-50 grams. Multiplying by five pieces results in a total weight estimate around 225 grams. This accounts for visible size, density, and the arrangement of pieces on the plate, which does not suggest extra hidden portions."
ppf8hc,poulet,98.0,210.0,112.0,1.3530571992110454,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/9c8fc2f7-062d-4701-885c-184a8d501c5b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'poulet' (chicken). The chicken piece appears as a large, boneless portion on the plate, roughly about 12 cm long and 7 cm wide based on comparison to the item next to it (frites/french fries). The chicken piece is moderately thick, about 2-3 cm, as inferred from the visible side and sauce pooling around the base. The plate's structure and fries size provide good scale - fries are about 7-8 cm long on average. The chicken piece is dense meat, and its volume can be approximated by length x width x thickness: 12 cm x 7 cm x 2.5 cm = 210 cubic cm. Cooked chicken breast density is close to 1 g/cm³, slightly less due to cooking moisture loss, but given the visible juices, assume near 1 g/cm³. Therefore, estimated weight is about 210 grams. This also aligns visually with the portion size compared to typical chicken breast sizes served in Switzerland. The estimate fits well in context: larger than salad and eggs portions, somewhat smaller but comparable to fries portion weight. Hence, the most reasonable estimation for the weight of the poulet on this plate is approximately 210 grams."
p96w4a,asperges,73.0,180.0,107.0,0.9628944773175543,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/0513b8db-8592-4ef7-aacf-c117d4030b25,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'asperges' (asparagus). Visually, there are approximately 8 asparagus spears on the plate. Each spear appears to be about 15-18 cm long, with an average thickness typical for asparagus (around 1-1.2 cm diameter). Using the plate diameter as a reference — a standard plate is about 25-27 cm across — the asparagus length estimation holds. The asparagus are mostly whole and laid out flat, allowing for a good volume estimate. Asparagus is mostly water with a density close to 1g/cm³ but slightly less dense than water. An average spear of this size weighs about 20-25 grams. Multiplying by 8 spears gives an estimated total weight of approximately 160-200 grams. Given the spears are not overly thick and some may be slightly thinner, choosing a median value around 180 grams is reasonable. Considering the visual portion and the density, 180 grams is a precise estimate for the asparagus portion shown."
m4egh2,oeufs brouillés,145.0,250.0,105.0,1.8768491124260356,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/9631ea21-d42e-4129-bd57-c4a1aa521e20,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is ""oeufs brouillés"" (scrambled eggs) on the plate. Visually, the scrambled eggs occupy roughly a quarter of the plate. The plate diameter appears to be a standard size of about 24 cm (inferred from the wooden table and familiar portion sizes of gnocchi and cauliflower). The scrambled eggs portion consists of loosely piled soft curds about 4-5 cm thick at the thickest point. The volume is therefore about 1/4 of the plate area times 4 cm thickness. The area of the plate is about π * (12 cm)^2 = ~452 cm²; 1/4 of that is ~113 cm². Multiplying by approximate thickness (4 cm) gives a volume of about 450 cm³. Scrambled eggs have a density close to 0.9 g/cm³ (eggs are dense but fluffy due to air incorporation). Thus, 450 cm³ * 0.9 g/cm³ equals about 405 grams, but this seems visually large given the size relative to other foods. Adjusting down to approximately 3 cm thickness (more realistic for portion) results in 113 * 3 = 339 cm³, and weight around 305 grams. Considering the eggs are loosely piled, with some air gaps, the realistic estimate should be about 250 grams. This matches the size relative to gnocchi (which appear dense and measurable) and cauliflower pieces. Hence, I estimate the scrambled eggs (oeufs brouillés) portion to weigh around 250 grams."
ppf8hc,spaghetti,217.0,320.0,103.0,2.755300788954635,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/7c7d7932-0ffe-47e1-83e9-2289044511e5,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'spaghetti'. The spaghetti is on a black plate, and comparing it to the diameter of the plate and the knife handle nearby, the portion covers a substantial part of the plate's center. The spaghetti is cooked, appearing loosely piled with some space between strands. The plate's diameter is approximately 22-24 cm (typical size). The spaghetti mound looks to be about 15 cm in diameter, with an average thickness of about 3-4 cm based on the height of the pile relative to the plate’s edge and shadows. Given that cooked spaghetti density is relatively high but the strands are loosely packed, the volume is roughly 15 cm x 15 cm x 3.5 cm = about 787.5 cubic cm. Considering cooked spaghetti has a density near 1 g/cm^3, but the loose packing reduces effective density slightly. Accounting for this, a reasonable density adjustment would be 0.9 g/cm^3. This leads to an estimated weight around 709 grams. However, this seems very high for this amount visually. Reevaluating, the pile is fluffy and has considerable air space, so the actual mass may be closer to about half the raw volumetric calculation, thus closer to 350-400 grams. Also, observing the pesto and gruyère presence which adds minor weight, but focusing only on spaghetti, and given the typical portion sizes and the actual visual volume, it is safer to estimate around 320 grams for the spaghetti itself. This estimation fits the visual scale with the fork/knife handle and plate size and the loose pasta density. Therefore, I confidently estimate the spaghetti portion to weigh about 320 grams."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,320.0,97.0,4.986316568047338,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'salade de tomates', which is visually identifiable as sliced tomatoes arranged on a medium-sized plate. The plate is typical dinner plate size, around 25 cm in diameter, allowing a good size comparison. The tomato slices are thick, roughly 1.5 cm, and there are about 12 to 15 slices visible, arranged in a single layer covering most of the plate surface. A medium tomato weighs roughly 150 to 180 grams. Given the number of slices and volume, it seems equivalent to about two medium tomatoes. Tomato density is quite high as they are dense with water content. Olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and flaxseeds are thinly drizzled or sprinkled on top and add negligible weight compared to the tomatoes themselves. Therefore, the total weight of the tomato slices visible in the salad should approximate 300 to 350 grams. Considering the whole visible portion and some small pieces not fully visible, a precise estimate is about 320 grams to represent the 'salade de tomates' itself without added weight from dressing or seeds."

The specified food is 'salade de carotte, mais, tomates', which is the salad portion on the plate. It appears as a mixed salad of shredded carrot, corn kernels, halved cherry tomatoes, and some leafy spinach. The salad is placed on a blue plate along with two pizza slices to provide size context. The plate diameter is roughly about 25 cm based on typical plate sizes and relative pizza slice size. The salad occupies a roughly circular area approximately 8 cm across. The salad is a loose composition, not heaped, with visible fluffy texture and moist content, suggesting moderate density. The height/thickness of the salad is about 1.5 cm judging by shadows and how much it rises above the plate. The salad is well mixed and the carrot and corn pieces are small and dense; carrots shredded are compact but light, corn is denser, tomatoes add some volume but are lighter. Considering density, roughly 0.5 g/cm3 is a reasonable approximation for this type of salad mixture. Calculating volume: area = π * (4 cm)^2 = ~50 cm2; multiplied by 1.5 cm height = 75 cm3 volume roughly. Density at 0.5 g/cm3 yields about 37.5 grams. To verify, the salad portion visually occupies about 1/4 of a pizza slice's volume or less, consistent with a small portion around 35-40 grams. This is plausible given the size and volume relative to pizza slices and plate. Hence, the estimated weight is 38 grams."
wrah5h,"légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)",198.0,105.0,93.0,2.2699704142011834,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/5e117510-fc82-4a06-a502-12983d55aac5,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)'. Visually, the sautéed vegetables occupy roughly a third of the plate area. The plate diameter appears standard, about 22 cm approximately, based on the glass and tablecloth pattern as references. The vegetables form a somewhat dense pile consisting mainly of sliced carrots and leek pieces, cooked and slightly glossy from oil. The pile's thickness is moderate, estimated around 2-3 cm, judging by shadows and the height compared to the fish piece next to them. Considering the density of cooked carrots and leek (both fairly water-rich but denser than leafy vegetables), an average density around 0.7 grams per cm3 is reasonable. Estimating the volume roughly as a segment about 10 cm by 6 cm by 2.5 cm gives 150 cubic cm. Multiplying volume by density: 150 cm3 * 0.7 g/cm3 = 105 grams. This aligns well with expected portion size for cooked mixed vegetables on a meal plate. Cross-checked with the size and mass of fish and rice on the plate, this weight is plausible. Therefore, the estimated weight for the 'légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)' is about 105 grams."
wrah5h,pâtes,148.0,240.0,92.0,1.6785009861932938,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/115dbd14-27ca-4200-a232-fa9f3eb9bad7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'pâtes' (pasta). From the image, the pasta is spiral-shaped and occupies roughly the right half of the rectangular metal container. The container's width is about twice the length of a grilled chicken strip on the left side, which measures roughly 12-13 cm in length based on visual comparison to a standard plastic tray base visible at the bottom. The pasta pile reaches a thickness of about 2-3 cm, verified by shadow and edge visibility against the container. The portion is dense as cooked pasta absorbs water but still has substantial mass. The spiral pasta shape increases volume slightly but does not hugely affect density compared to flat pasta. The pasta is topped with tomato sauce and sprinkled with grated parmesan, but we exclude these from the pasta's weight estimation. Comparing to the known average chicken slice size and green beans beside it, the pasta portion covers a reasonable half of the container's floor area and about half the container's volume when accounting for the pasta pile height. Volume estimation for pasta is approximately 12 cm (width) x 9 cm (length) x 2.5 cm (height) = 270 cm³. Cooked pasta density is about 0.92 g/cm³ roughly. Multiplying volume by density gives approximately 270 * 0.92 = 248 grams. Considering some irregularities, some small air gaps between spirals, and sauce presence, a small reduction is reasonable. Thus, the pasta weight is estimated close to 240 grams."
8japfq,pomme,213.0,130.0,83.0,2.179363905325444,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/124b4ec0-4fda-4c14-aee4-e31ac6a94b5c,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item to estimate is 'pomme' (apple). The apple visible in the image appears to be a small to medium-sized apple, judging by its size relative to the croissant next to it and the wooden table pattern. Typical apples vary in weight greatly depending on size, but this one is somewhat compact and shorter compared to larger apples often seen. The croissant is fairly large, roughly 15 cm long, so the apple is substantially smaller in comparison and slightly wider than half the croissant's length. Considering the apple's shape (short and stout) and size relative to this croissant, the apple likely weighs less than a typical large apple. A typical small to medium apple weighs around 150 grams, and this appears to be on the smaller side. Therefore, a precise estimate for this apple is approximately 130 grams, as it looks compact and dense but not very large. This estimation aligns with the visual cues and the relative size ratio between the croissant and the apple. Thus, the estimated weight is 130 grams."
r3bub9,raviolis a la courge,143.0,220.0,77.0,1.357371794871795,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/r3bub9/dish_media/17c1535c-dc84-4dbb-9668-1d3f9a4a135d,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'raviolis a la courge' on the plate. Visually, there are 7 visible ravioli pieces spread on the plate. Each ravioli appears roughly square, about 4.5 cm per side, and about 1.2 cm thick (estimated by comparing to the cherry tomatoes nearby which are about 2.5 cm diameter). The ravioli are quite flat but filled, so the volume is moderate. Fresh ravioli dough is dense, and the squash filling adds some moisture and density. Using approximate volume: 4.5 cm x 4.5 cm x 1.2 cm = 24.3 cm³ per ravioli. Fresh pasta with filling generally weighs about 1.3 g/cm³; therefore, each ravioli weighs approximately 31.6 g. Multiplying by 7 ravioli: 31.6 g x 7 = 221 g. This is consistent with the moderate portion size observed compared to the plate size and the other foods present. The other items and the plate dimensions validate this as a plausible total weight. Therefore, the estimated total weight of the raviolis a la courge on this plate is about 220 grams."
p8a2w5,sauce bolognese,136.0,63.0,73.0,1.2238658777120315,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/abad1443-f704-4eb9-9657-7a67252ff801,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'sauce bolognese,' which is the reddish sauce visible on top of the pasta. The sauce covers a central portion of the pasta, roughly a rectangle about 12 cm long and 6 cm wide, with an average thickness that can be estimated around 0.8 cm based on the visible depth and spread. There is some overlap with cheese on top, but the cheese is fairly grated and porous, not dense enough to drastically obscure the sauce volume. The sauce looks dense and chunky but not overly watery. The plate appears to be a standard medium-sized dinner plate roughly 25 cm across, helping confirm size. Given the volume estimate: 12 cm x 6 cm x 0.8 cm = 57.6 cm3. The density of bolognese sauce is relatively close to water but somewhat thicker, roughly around 1.1 g/cm3, so the estimated weight is 57.6 x 1.1 = approximately 63 grams. Considering some sauce may be partially mixed with the pasta and some cheese interspersed, the actual sauce visible alone is about 60-65 grams. This estimate is consistent with the portion size relative to the pasta and cheese, and the overall plate context makes this weight plausible."

The specified food item is 'croissants au jambon.' In the image, there are two small croissants, darker golden-brown in color, located at the upper left side of the plate. They are visibly smaller than a typical large croissant but appear to be filled with ham (presumed due to the item name and visible texture showing some density typical of ham croissants). The croissants are slightly bigger than the radishes and roughly half the size of the baguette pieces on the plate. Each croissant is approximately 7-8 cm in length and 4-5 cm in width, with a thickness of around 3-4 cm based on shadow and appearance comparison to the knife and fork nearby. Ham filling is dense, adding slightly to weight beyond a plain croissant. A typical small ham croissant of this size would weigh less than a large one but more than a plain bread roll of the same size, so around 50-60 grams each seems plausible. For two croissants, this approximates 100-120 grams total. Given visual density and size, 110 grams is a reasonable precise estimation. This fits well when balancing with the other plate items that include similarly sized pieces of bread, slices of meat, cheese, and vegetable sticks."

The food item specified is 'fraises' (strawberries). In the image, there are three strawberries placed in a small green bowl. The bowl's diameter appears to be about 10-12 cm based on relative size to typical wood floor floorboards. The strawberries are relatively large, roughly 5-6 cm in length each, with average width about 3-4 cm and a thickness around 3 cm. Strawberries' density is mostly water, so their weight can be approximated from their apparent volume. Calculating volume roughly as ellipsoids (length × width × thickness × 0.52), each strawberry is about 5 x 3.5 x 3 cm × 0.52 = approximately 27 cm³. Given the density of strawberries close to water (~1 g/cm³), each strawberry weighs about 27 grams. There are three strawberries, but sizes vary: two large, one smaller. Estimating the smaller one at around 20 grams, and the two larger ones around 27 and 28 grams, total weight is approximately 75 grams. This is plausible given the bowl size and the visible volume of strawberries with their stems. Therefore, the estimated total weight is 75 grams."

The specified food item is 'poire' (pear). The image shows approximately six irregular pieces of pear inside a plastic container. The container's volume marker indicates 0.52 liters, helping us gauge size. Each pear piece is relatively large, with thickness around 2-3 cm and length about 6-8 cm, based on the container size and cross-sectional dimensions. Pears typically have a density around 0.6-0.7 g/cm³. Visually, these pieces combined fill about a quarter of the container volume, estimating roughly 150-200 ml of pear volume. Multiplying by density, the weight is approximately in the 100-140 gram range. Accounting for the exact visible volume and typical pear density, a precise estimation is about 120 grams total for all pear pieces combined. This matches well with the portion size and relative volume observed in the container compared to the container dimensions and pear piece sizes."

The food item specified is 'pain/galette,' which visually corresponds to the two rolled flatbreads (like tortilla wraps) visible in the metal container. From the image, the container appears to be a standard metal lunch box, roughly mid-size. The flatbread pieces are folded and cover about two-thirds of the container's length. Each flatbread seems to be around 20-22 cm in length and about 10 cm wide, based on the container size and visible surface area. The thickness of the flatbreads is thin (around 2-3 mm) with some folding and layering, indicating they are somewhat flexible and soft. Such flatbreads typically weigh less than thicker breads but more than very thin wraps. Estimating the density and thickness visually, each flatbread (fully unfolded) of this size and thinness usually weighs around 70-90 grams. Since there are two pieces, and one is partially eaten (about 70-80% remaining), I estimate approximately 80 grams for the intact piece and about 55-60 grams for the partial piece. This totals around 135-140 grams. Considering the visual volume, size relative to the container, and the density of this kind of bread, I estimate the total 'pain/galette' weight in the image to be about 140 grams, which is reasonable and consistent with the relative scale of the container and other contents. This avoids overestimation due to the bread's thinness and visible fold patterns."

The specified food item is 'salade verte' on a dinner plate containing several foods. The green salad is positioned near the bottom right of the plate, composed mostly of iceberg or similar leafy lettuce with some dressing. To estimate weight, I compare the salad portion relative to the other items on the plate. The plate diameter is standard about 25 cm. The salad occupies roughly a quarter of the plate area but is quite thin and leafy. Lettuce has low density and is mostly air. The salad pieces appear about 2-3 cm thick. Using relative size of the fork handle (visible) as reference, the volume is approximately 180-220 cm³. Given that lettuce density including dressing averages roughly 0.3-0.4 g/cm³, multiplying volume by density yields about 60-80 grams. Compared to other items, this is a reasonable mid-sized salad portion matching the visible volume. Therefore, a precise estimate for the salade verte is 70 grams."

The specified food item is 'riz complet.' Observing the image, we see a portion of brown rice on the plate, roughly piled beside the salmon and salad. The rice portion covers an area approximately 10 cm by 7 cm on the plate with a modest height, appearing somewhat fluffy but clearly cooked and dense. Using the plate diameter as reference (a standard plate is about 25 cm in diameter), the rice portion is about one-third the diameter in length and less wide. The pile height is modest, estimating about 1.5-2 cm thick. The density of cooked brown rice is about 1.1 g/cm3 approximately. Estimating volume: length (10 cm) x width (7 cm) x height (1.7 cm avg) = 119 cm3. Multiplying density: 119 cm3 x 1.1 g/cm3 = approximately 131 g. Visually, this amount matches a moderate portion of cooked rice, aligning with the rest of the meal size. Therefore, the estimated weight is around 130 grams."

The specified food item is 'viande' (meat). Visually locating the viande on the plate, it is the cooked ground meat patty located at the bottom left of the plate. The size can be compared to the potatoes and the plate diameter, which is a standard dinner plate of approximately 25-27 cm diameter. The meat piece spans about 8-10 cm in length and about 5-6 cm in width, with a thickness of roughly 1.5-2 cm based on shadow and texture cues. The meat has a dense texture typical of cooked ground meat, indicating a density around 1 g/cm³. Estimating its volume: length (9 cm) x width (5.5 cm) x thickness (1.75 cm) = approximately 86 cm³. Given the density close to water (1 g/cm³), the weight is roughly equal to the volume in grams, about 85-90 grams. Comparing to the potatoes (each about 50-70 grams) and the overall plate composition confirms the result is plausible for a moderate serving of meat. Therefore, the estimated weight for the viande is 88 grams, a precise and visually supported estimate."

The salade consists of green leafy lettuce, shredded carrot strips, and visible chunks of avocado, all lightly coated with olive oil and vinegar. The volume of the salad on the plate appears moderate, occupying nearly half the plate surface, similar in size to both fried eggs combined. Considering the density of lettuce (light), carrots (moderate), and avocado (dense), the avocado pieces are sparsely distributed but contribute significantly to the weight. The salad has visible oily dressing which adds some weight but minimally. Comparing to the eggs and the piece of bread (about the size of a small baguette end piece), the salad likely weighs more than a light leafy salad alone but less than a dense cooked vegetable serving. Given these factors, the estimated weight for this composite salad with mixed ingredients and dressing is about 120 grams."

The specified food is 'tiramisu.' In the image, the tiramisu is the left portion on the black plate. Comparing it with the 'forêt noir' cake slice on the right side of the plate, we see that the tiramisu piece is larger in volume with visible layers of soaked sponge and creamy mascarpone. The plate appears to be a dessert or small appetizer plate, approximately 20 cm in diameter. The tiramisu piece is about 8 cm long, 4 cm wide, and roughly 3.5 cm thick. Considering the creamy, moist texture of tiramisu and its relatively dense mascarpone and soaked ladyfingers, typical density is higher than a light cake but less dense than dry bread. Using volume estimation 8 x 4 x 3.5 = 112 cm³. Assuming a density around 1 g/cm³ due to the moisture content, the weight estimate is approximately 110-115 g. The visible portion size and density compared to the forêt noir slice make this plausible. Therefore, the best precise estimate for the tiramisu weight is 113 grams."

The specified food item is 'oeufs' (eggs). In the image, there is one fried egg placed on top of the pasta. The egg is cooked with the yolk partially intact and some spread out egg white. By comparing the egg size to the fusilli pasta below, and the plate edges, the egg is a standard medium to large sized egg. A typical medium fried egg weighs about 50 grams when cooked, accounting for some moisture loss but including both white and yolk as visible in the image. The egg's shape and spread on the plate look consistent with a single egg size without additional portions. Thus, considering the visual size and the density of cooked eggs, the estimated weight is 50 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread (pain) on a standard dessert plate. The plate's diameter is approximately 20-22 cm based on typical plate sizes. Each slice occupies a little less than half of the plate's diameter in length, estimating about 12-14 cm long, and approximately 7-8 cm wide. The bread is moderately thick with a crust and a light, airy crumb visible. Given the size and thickness visible, and comparing to typical fresh bread slices of similar dimensions, each slice likely weighs between 40 and 50 grams. Since both slices appear similar in size and there are two slices, the combined weight of the 'pain' (bread) is around 85 grams. This estimate is grounded in visual size relative to the plate, the thickness visible, and typical density of fresh bread."

The specified food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries), which are mixed visibly within a bowl of cereal, yogurt, and other ingredients. The bowl diameter appears to be around 15-18 cm, a typical medium-sized breakfast bowl. The blueberries are scattered throughout the bowl and are medium-sized, about 1.5-2 cm in diameter each, with approximately 20-25 visible berries evenly mixed in the cereal and yogurt mixture. Blueberries have a density close to water but slightly less due to air pockets inside, approximately 0.95 g/cm³. Each berry's volume (assuming rough sphere, diameter ~1.8 cm) is about 3 cm³, giving a weight of about 2.85 grams per berry. Multiplying by 22 berries gives approximately 63 grams. Considering some portion may be hidden or submerged and to allow for some variation in berry size, a slightly rounded estimate is 60 grams. This fits plausibly with the bowl size and volume of the other ingredients; it is a realistic amount for a single serving mixed in a yogurt and cereal bowl."

The image shows a slice of strawberry tart on a standard-sized dessert plate. The diameter of a typical dessert plate is about 20 cm. The tart slice covers roughly a quarter of the plate's diameter, estimating about 10 cm by 5 cm in surface area. The thickness of the tart is about 3 cm, as judged by the height of the cream and fruit layer relative to the plate rim and the visible crust thickness. The tart has a base crust that looks crumbly and relatively thin (~0.5 cm), a creamy filling (~2 cm), and a topping of several halved strawberries and some red berries. Strawberries are relatively dense; these appear fresh and juicy but not overly heavy. The cream layer adds significant volume but less density. Considering density variations, a berry tart slice of this size typically weighs between 120-150 grams. Given the observed thickness, density, and volume, an estimate near 130 grams is reasonable. The crumbs around the plate are minimal and do not add significant weight. This estimate aligns well with the size of the plate and the tart slice relative to other cutlery visible in the background for scale. Therefore, the estimated weight of this 'tarte aux fraises' slice is 130 grams."

The specified item is 'légumes (courgette, oignon, 1 cs d'huile d'olive)' which visually corresponds to the cooked mixture of sliced zucchini and onions on the left side of the plate. The vegetables are sautéed, showing moderate moisture and oil content from the indicated 1 tablespoon of olive oil. The plate diameter is typical around 25 cm; the vegetable portion covers roughly a quarter of the plate surface in a somewhat shallow layer. The zucchini slices average about 5 cm in length and around 0.5 cm thickness; onions appear in thin strips intermixed similarly. Volume wise, this looks like about 150-180 ml of cooked vegetables. Knowing that cooked zucchini and onion have densities near 0.8 to 1 g/ml due to water content and sautéed oil, this equates roughly to 130-160 grams. Considering the presence of olive oil adds some mass but is minimal, and the portion is not heaped, a precise estimate is about 150 grams for the combined vegetables. This estimate is consistent with relative portion sizes on the plate compared to the rice (about 160-180 g) and the fried egg (about 50 g)."

The specified food is 'tomme fleurette'. On the plate, the tomme fleurette can be identified as the two white-brined cheese pieces with creamy yellow interiors on the lower right side of the plate. They appear to be small triangular slices roughly 4 cm in width and about 1.5 cm in thickness. Judging from the fork and knife size, each slice is approximately the size of a large bite of cheese. Tomme cheese generally has a semi-soft texture and moderate density. Each slice appears to be about 20 to 25 grams by volume considering the thickness and density. There are two such pieces visible, so total weight is around 45 grams. This fits logically given the plate size, the presence of other cheeses, and typical serving sizes for cheese tastings. Therefore, estimating the total weight of the tomme fleurette on the plate as approximately 45 grams is reasonable and well supported by visual cues."

The specified food item is 'muesli nature'. The muesli is served in a small round bowl to the right in the image. This bowl’s diameter appears to be around 10 cm based on the size comparison with the white dish containing yogurt on the left, which has handles and is roughly 15 cm wide from handle to handle. The muesli inside the bowl is not densely packed but loosely piled, consisting of relatively large clusters. Visual estimation shows the bowl is filled to about 80% height. Assuming a typical bowl height of about 5 cm, the muesli fill height is roughly 4 cm. The clusters have a light, airy structure so density is low compared to fully compacted foods. Considering this, the actual volume of the muesli is around 314 cm² (area of bowl base ~pi * radius² = 3.14 * 5² = 78.5 cm²) multiplied by 4 cm height = approx 314 cm³ volume. Given muesli's approximate density about 0.3 g/cm³ due to clusters having air gaps, the estimated weight becomes 314 cm³ * 0.3 g/cm³ = approx 94 g. The appearance of the pile and bowl size support this estimate; it is roughly a small bowl serving, not heaped. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'muesli nature' is about 95 grams."

The container appears to be a standard meal prep style container approximately 18 cm long and 12 cm wide. The tomato pieces are thin slices with an average thickness of about 0.5 cm, loosely arranged without stacking. Visually, this portion looks like one medium tomato cut into slices. Taking the length and width of the container as reference, the tomato slices cover an area about 7 cm by 5 cm roughly. Given the average density of fresh tomato (~0.95 g/cm3) and factoring in the water content and the loose stacking, the volume can be estimated to approximately 20-25 cm3. Multiplying volume by density gives a weight estimate in the range of 20-25 grams. This aligns well with a modest portion of tomato slices seen here, neither too sparse nor dense."

The dish is served in a decorative bowl about 18 cm in diameter, based on the visible hand and fingers holding it, which provides the scale. The galettes millet haricots noirs maïs are the three dense, round, grain-based patties on the right-center of the bowl. Each galette appears roughly 6 cm in diameter and about 1.5 to 2 cm thick, resembling a compact patty made mainly from millet, black beans, and corn bits. The texture is dense but crumbly. Using the visual size comparison to the mushrooms on the left (which are sliced and usually about 2-3 cm pieces) and the leafy greens (lettuce leaves are common and large), each galette likely weighs approximately 70 to 80 grams because of the solid grain and bean content. Three galettes together would total around 210 to 240 grams. Considering potential slight overestimation and the compactness, I place the total weight of the three galettes at 225 grams. This estimate excludes other food items and container weight, strictly applying observed size, density cues, and relative scale to the bowl and other ingredients."

Visually analyzing the apple in the image, it appears to be a small to medium-sized variety, based on its comparison to the texture and grain of the surface it is on (a table) with no other immediate size references like a hand or cutlery. It's roughly spherical but has some irregularities, with an estimated diameter about 6 to 7 cm. Given the apple's apparent size and typical density, an apple of this size usually weighs around 120 grams, which is consistent with the visible volume and common apple weight distribution. Since this apple looks somewhat smaller and more compressed than an average large apple, estimating the weight slightly under a medium-sized apple is reasonable. Overall, based on what is visible without assumptions beyond the size cues, 120 grams is a precise and plausible estimate."

The salad portion occupies a small area, about 5 cm by 4 cm, and is relatively thin, approximately 1 to 1.5 cm thick as judged by the slight shadow and leaf layering. The salad appears to be composed mainly of leafy greens and some chopped vegetables which have low density. Leafy greens have low density and a small volume typically corresponds to a light weight. Based on the visible volume and density, a typical salad portion of this size would roughly weigh around 35 to 45 grams. Given the careful observation of size, thickness, and type of ingredients, the best estimate is approximately 40 grams."

The image shows a stack of four Blevita crackers, identifiable by their size, color, and the embossed brand name. Each cracker is roughly rectangular, with visible small perforations and a relatively thin profile. Based on visual comparison to the wooden table grain and the thickness inferred from the stacked height, each cracker appears typical in size for Blevita crackers, approximately 5 cm by 7 cm and about 0.3 cm thick. Blevita crackers are relatively dense but light due to their dry, crisp texture. A typical single Blevita cracker weighs about 10 grams. Since there are four crackers stacked here, the total weight is approximately 4 times 10 grams, equaling 40 grams. This matches the visual impression of the stack thickness and the known individual cracker density. Therefore, the best estimate for the total weight of these four Blevita crackers is 40 grams."

The specified food is 'beurre' (butter). There are four slices of bread on the plate, each with a visible spread of butter underneath the strawberry jam. The butter layer on each slice seems moderate - not a thin smear but also not very thick. Typically, a thin to moderate spread covers a slice with roughly 5 to 7 grams of butter. Considering the edges and some patches where butter is less thick, I estimate about 6 grams per slice. Multiplying for 4 slices gives roughly 24 grams of butter in total. Cross-referencing this with the size of the bread slices (approximately 10 cm long each), and comparing with the volume of jam and fruit, this estimate seems consistent and plausible. Therefore, the total butter weight is about 24 grams."

The specified food item is ""galettes millet haricots noirs maïs."" These are on the right side of the glass container, shaped into 5 small patties. Each galette is roughly circular, about 6 cm in diameter, and approximately 1.5 cm thick, based on comparison with the sliced courgette and onions on the left side and the size of the glass container, which is a standard meal prep size (about 15 cm by 15 cm). The galettes appear dense given the millet and beans, with a moderately compact structure rather than airy. Considering density comparable to cooked grains with added beans and corn, I estimate about 35 grams per patty, with 5 patties visible. Multiplying 35g by 5 equals 175 grams total. This aligns well with the container size and the volume occupied by the galettes. The consistency and texture visible do not suggest overly dry or fluffy, supporting this moderate density estimate. Thus, the total weight estimate for the ""galettes millet haricots noirs maïs"" is 175 grams."

The specified food item is 'maréchal', which visually corresponds to the cheese cubes on the plate. There are four small cubes, each approximately 2 cm per side, judging by the size relative to the cucumber slices (roughly 6 cm diameter) and the eggs. Each cube appears solid and dense, typical of semi-hard cheese. Cheese density is about 1.1 g/cm³. Volume per cube is roughly 2 cm × 2 cm × 2 cm = 8 cm³. Weight per cube is therefore around 8 cm³ × 1.1 g/cm³ = 8.8 g. For four cubes, total weight is approximately 35 g. This estimate is supported by the individual cube size and visual scaling with other food items on the plate. Hence, 35 grams is a precise and plausible estimate."

The specified food item is 'hummous,' located at the bottom left of the plate. The portion of hummous looks like a small scoop, approximately 5 cm wide, 3 cm deep, and about 1.5 cm thick. Using the plate's edge as a reference, which is roughly 23 cm in diameter, and comparing the hummous to the other items (e.g., the olives and strawberries), this seems to be a small serving. Hummous density is relatively thick and dense, similar to a soft paste. Estimating volume roughly as an oval scoop of about 5 x 3 x 1.5 cm gives approximately 22.5 cm^3. Hummous density is close to about 1 g/cm^3, so the weight in grams would be around 20 to 25 grams. Given the visual fullness and texture, a precise estimate would be about 23 grams. This fits the overall plate portion context without overestimating."

The specified food item is ""chips vaya beans,"" visible in the image as a pile of thin, flat, fried or baked crisps that appear slightly translucent with green and dark spots, likely indicating pieces of beans or flavoring. These chips are placed on a standard small to medium-sized decorative plate. By using the plate diameter, typically about 20-22 cm, as a size reference, the chips cover a central area approximately 12-14 cm across, piled to a modest height not exceeding 2-3 cm. Each chip is relatively thin and lightweight. The pile contains roughly 15-20 chips, many overlapping. Considering the airiness and density, these chips resemble bean crisps that are less dense than corn chips but still reasonably substantial. Estimating an average individual chip weight around 2-3 grams based on size (approximately 6-7 cm per chip with variable breakage) and adding them up leads to a total weight estimate around 40-50 grams. The visual volume and density align with that range, and the portion seems plausible given the plate size and chip type. Therefore, a precise estimate for the weight of the ""chips vaya beans"" is 45 grams."

The specified food item is 'barre de chocolat kinder,' which visually corresponds to the chocolate bar in the image. This bar matches the Kinder Bueno white variant, identifiable by its white chocolate coating with brown powder stripes and the shape with 5 segments. The chocolate bar is placed on a wooden surface with visible grain and slats, helping to estimate size. Each segment appears about 2 cm wide, and the entire bar is roughly 10 cm long and about 1.5 cm thick. Given these dimensions, the volume and density, and recognizing standard packaging, a single Kinder Bueno white bar (one full bar) typically weighs approximately 39 grams. Despite multiple mentions of the item in the list, the image shows only one bar, so the weight estimate is for this single visible bar. Thus, based on visual scale and known product weight, the estimated weight is 39 grams."

The specified food item is 'pain' (bread). There are two pieces of bread on the plate, each spread with different toppings (beurre, mélasse, confiture). The bread slices appear to be artisanal with a crusty edge and an open crumb structure. The plate is a common size (about 25-27 cm in diameter), which helps to scale the pieces. Each bread piece is about 7 cm long and 5 cm wide with an approximate thickness of 2 cm. The density of bread is lower than dense foods, with noticeable air pockets. Considering its volume (7x5x2 = 70 cm³ per piece) and the typical density of crusty bread around 0.25 to 0.3 g/cm³, each piece would weigh roughly 18 to 21 grams. Together the two pieces likely weigh around 40 grams. Since the task is to estimate weight of 'pain' and both slices are bread, the total bread weight is around 40 grams. This is reasonable considering the size compared to the knife handle and plate size, and fits the visible portion and bread type without overestimation."

The specified food item is 'pousses de graines' (sprouts). In the image, they are the collection of small sprouted seeds located primarily in the left-center part of the bowl, mixed lightly among spinach leaves and cherry tomato halves. To estimate the weight, let's first assess the volume. The sprouts cover roughly a 7 cm by 5 cm area in the bowl, with an average height of about 1-1.5 cm, inferred from their typical sprout length and visible layering. This suggests a volume around 35-52.5 cm³. Sprouts are low density with some moisture content. Typically, the density of sprouted seeds is approximately 0.3 to 0.4 grams per cm³ due to air gaps and water content. Multiplying volume by density: 40 cm³ (approximate middle volume) * 0.35 g/cm³ results in about 14 grams. Cross-checking with the size of spinach leaves and cherry tomatoes confirms this is a modest layer of sprouts, supporting the estimate. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'pousses de graines' in the bowl is about 14 grams."

The specified food item is 'tarte à la rhubarbe,' which is a slice of rhubarb tart. Visually, the tart slice is on a standard-sized dessert plate, near a knife and fork. The tart slice occupies roughly one-fourth of a typical round tart, estimating a diameter of about 25 cm for the whole tart, so the slice length is around 12 cm. The thickness of the tart appears to be about 1.5 to 2 cm, judged by the side view relative to the fork's thickness. The tart filling consists mainly of rhubarb pieces embedded in a custard or cream base, resting on a pastry crust. Rhubarb is not very dense but does add weight; the custard and pastry crust add some density too. Considering the visible amount of fruit pieces - numerous small chunks - the tart slice is moderately dense overall. Given these observations and the size proportions, it is reasonable to estimate the weight of the tart slice as about 120 grams, since a full tart typically ranges from 400 to 500 grams total and the slice is about one quarter. Cross-checking with the fork and knife sizes confirms this is a plausible estimate. Therefore, 120 grams is a precise and conservative estimate of the weight of this tarte à la rhubarbe slice."

The specified food item is 'sauce vinaigrette'. In the image, the vinaigrette is visible as a small amount of oil-based dressing mostly on top of the grated carrots and pieces of tofu to the left and center of the container. There is no separate container or pool of the sauce; it is lightly distributed. The visible vinaigrette volume is inferred to be quite small, likely a thin drizzle rather than a poured portion. Compared to other foods in this container, such as quinoa (dense and filling about a third of the container), tofu chunks, and fresh chopped fruits and vegetables, the vinaigrette appears minimal in volume. Given the shallow layer and typical density of vinaigrette (roughly 0.9 g/ml for oil-based dressings), the volume is estimated at approximately 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) but visually it seems closer to about 15 ml considering light coverage. This corresponds approximately to 13 to 14 grams of vinaigrette. Considering the limited visible quantity and spread, a more precise estimate is about 13 grams. This is plausible relative to the portion size visible and in line with typical light dressing use in a mixed dish of this size."

The image shows two slices of bread with spreads: one slice has confiture (jam) and butter, and the other slice has Nutella and butter. We are estimating the weight of beurre (butter) only. The butter portion is thinly spread on both slices, covering roughly around half to two-thirds of each slice's surface. The bread slices appear to be about standard rustic French bread, roughly 12 cm wide and 8-9 cm tall, with an average thickness of about 1.5 cm. Butter spread thickness is thin, approximately 1 to 2 mm. Butter's density is about 0.911 g/cm³. Calculating approximate volume for butter: each slice has around 70 cm² surface covered by butter (half of the 150 cm² slice surface), multiplied by 0.15 cm thickness gives about 10.5 cm³ per slice. For two slices, total volume is about 21 cm³. Weight = volume × density = 21 cm³ × 0.911 g/cm³ = ~19.1 g. Given the spread is slightly uneven and thin, rounding to about 18 g total butter weight spread over the bread is reasonable. This accounts for visible coverage and thickness rather than assuming standard pats or pieces. No other butter is visible elsewhere. Therefore, the estimated weight of butter (beurre) on the bread is approximately 18 grams."

The specified food item is 'pain' (bread). Visually, the bread piece is on a standard-sized dessert plate with colorful fish pattern, likely about 20-22 cm in diameter. The bread piece covers about one-fourth of the plate's width. From this, the bread slice is approximately 9 cm long and 5 cm wide, with a height around 3 cm, visible from the crumb and crust thickness. The bread appears artisan style, somewhat dense but still aerated with visible air pockets, typical of French or Swiss country bread. Bread density is around 0.25 to 0.3 g/cm3 for this type. Volume is roughly estimated as length x width x height = 9 cm x 5 cm x 3 cm = 135 cm3. Multiplying by density 0.28 g/cm3 yields about 38 grams. Estimating bread weight from visual cues and size of the piece, about 35-40 grams is reasonable, so 38 grams is a precise estimate. This aligns with the size relative to the plate and crumb structure without overestimating thickness or density."

The mayonnaise portion is the small dollop placed on the left side of the plate. It appears to be a thick, creamy white sauce, with a height and spread dimension roughly equivalent to a tablespoon-sized dollop. Using the fork (standard fork tine length about 1.5 cm) near the top of the plate as a size reference, the mayonnaise mound is about 4-5 cm in its longest dimension and moderately thick (about 1.5-2 cm). Mayonnaise is dense but light in volume, with a typical density of about 0.9 g/cm³. Estimating the volume as an irregular blob roughly 4 cm x 3 cm x 1.5 cm gives approximately 18 cm³ in volume. Multiplying by its density (0.9 g/cm³) yields about 16 grams. Cross-referencing this with standard dollops of mayonnaise used in meals, this estimation fits well. The portion looks modest, neither an excessively large pile nor a slight smear. Thus, the estimated weight of the mayonnaise on the plate is around 16 grams."

The specified food item is a 'branche de chocolat,' which visually appears as a single chocolate stick with a textured surface, likely from nuts or crispy inclusions. The chocolate stick is about the length of a finger, estimated at roughly 10 cm long, about 2-2.5 cm in diameter, and has a dense, compact structure typical of chocolate confections with inclusions. By using the wooden surface grain and texture for scale, the size is consistent with a mid-sized chocolate bar or candy stick. Such a chocolate item typically weighs between 30 to 50 grams, depending on density and inclusions. Given the visible thickness and textured surface, a precise estimate would lean towards the middle range. Therefore, a reasonable and visually grounded estimation for this chocolate stick is approximately 40 grams."

The galettes (patties) of millet, corn, and black beans are located in the middle-bottom part of the container. They appear to be small, round, and relatively flat patties about 5 cm in diameter and roughly 1 to 1.5 cm thick. Each galette looks compact and dense due to the grains and beans components. There are two galettes visible. By comparing the size of the galettes to the container and the adjacent food items (the soft cheese pieces and the shredded salad), we can infer their approximate volume. Given the density of cooked millet, corn and beans, similar patties this size typically weigh around 40-50 grams each, as they are firm and contain dense legumes and grains. Two patties together would then weigh approximately 80-100 grams. Visually, these patties fill less than a third of the container base area, and their height is modest. Estimating each galette at about 45 grams is a balanced approach, leading to approximately 90 grams total. This estimate is plausible relative to the container size and the volume of other foods present."

The specified food is 'salade'. Visually, the salad occupies about half the plate, composed mainly of green leafy lettuce with some sunflower seeds. The plate size is standard, around 24-26 cm diameter, implied by the fork size on the right. The salad is loosely piled, so its density is low due to the volume of leaves and air space. The sunflower seeds add minor weight but are sparse. Compared to the risotto portion, which is dense and compact, the salad appears lighter. Estimating the salad pile volume roughly as a half circle about 12 cm diameter and about 1.5-2 cm thickness due to the leafy texture, the approximate volume is around 170-220 cm3. Since leaf lettuce is about 0.15-0.2 g/cm3 in density, this yields approximately 25-44 grams. Adding the weight contribution from seeds (~5 grams) and dressing (if any, minimal) slightly increases weight. Given this, a precise estimation of the salad's weight aligns around 40 grams. This is plausible relative to plate size and comparing the visible food portions, and consistent with leafy salad portions served in Switzerland."

The specified food item to estimate is 'carottes' (carrots). In the image, the carrots are visible as thin slices mixed with the other ingredients in a white bowl. Compared to the pasta and aubergines, the carrot pieces are relatively thin and flat. The bowl’s diameter seems to be about 18-20 cm based on the size of the lid and table surface visible. The carrots appear to be about half a centimeter thick in slices, and only a few slices are visible spread across the bowl, mainly on the right side with a piece on top. Given the sparse distribution and the thin slicing, I estimate the total volume of visible carrots to be small. Relative to the other ingredients, the carrots occupy roughly 10-15% of the bowl's visible content by volume. Carrots have a density close to 0.7 g/cm³. Given the bowl’s depth (~4-5 cm) and carrot spread, I estimate approximately 25-30 grams of carrots. This seems plausible relative to the pasta and aubergines portion sizes. Thus, the most accurate estimation based on visible size, thickness, and density is 28 grams."

The specified food item is ""pain"" (bread). In the image, there are three slices of bread on a plate, with some butter ('beurre') and strawberry jam ('confiture fraise') spread on top. Using the plate diameter as a reference, which is likely around 24 cm, each slice of bread measures approximately 10-12 cm in length and about 6-7 cm in width. The bread appears to be a typical artisanal dense loaf with some seed inclusions, with a visible crust and soft crumb. Thickness of each slice varies from about 1.5 to 2 cm. Bread density for this type of bread is typically around 250-300 g per 1000 cm3. Calculating approximate volume: length (11 cm) × width (7 cm) × thickness (1.8 cm) = about 139 cm3 per slice. Multiplied by density (around 0.27 g/cm3), gives approximately 37.5 grams per slice. There are three slices visible, but one is small crust piece and likely excluded as it was broken off; the two main full slices plus one smaller half-slice amount to roughly 2.5 slices in total volume. Thus, total bread weight is approximately 37.5 g × 2.5 = 94 grams, rounded to nearest whole number. This aligns well with visual and volume cues and does not overestimate the size relative to the plate and spread items. Therefore, the estimated weight of the bread slices visible is about 94 grams."

The waffle seems rectangular, about 10 cm by 7 cm, and relatively thin, around 1.5 cm thick. The texture and lightness suggests a typical homemade or store-bought waffle, which is not very dense but has some density due to cooked batter. Comparing the waffle size to the plate and the apple compote spread on top, the waffle's volume is roughly 10 x 7 x 1.5 cm = 105 cm³. Typical waffle density is around 0.3 to 0.4 g/cm³ given its aerated structure. Using 0.35 g/cm³ as a mid value, the waffle would weigh roughly 105 * 0.35 = 36.75 grams. This seems reasonable relative to the size and the plate. The apple compote is not included in this weight as per instructions. Therefore, the waffle weighs about 37 grams."

The item to estimate is 'branche de chocolat,' which is visible in the image as a chocolate bar held between fingers. The bar appears to be finger-sized, with a length roughly similar to the width of three fingers and thickness corresponding to a typical crunchy chocolate bar with small embedded nuts or crisps. The hand holding it provides a good size reference: an adult finger has an average width of about 1.8 to 2 cm. The chocolate bar is about 10-12 cm long, about 2.5 cm wide, and roughly 1 cm thick. It looks dense, made of chocolate with some inclusions, so the density is relatively high. Given these dimensions, a solid chocolate bar of this size and density would weigh around 30-40 grams. Considering it is a 'branche,' a crunchy chocolate stick, not a large solid block, 35 grams is a realistic estimate for this portion size visible in hand. This estimate aligns with typical commercial single-serving chocolate sticks. Hence, the estimated weight of the 'branche de chocolat' is 35 grams."

The specified food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries). The blueberries are contained in a small bowl held in one hand. The bowl is roughly the size of the palm, which gives a diameter around 9-10 cm and a depth around 4-5 cm. The blueberries appear to be medium-sized, each about 1.2-1.5 cm in diameter. The bowl is almost full, so the volume is nearly fully occupied by berries. Blueberries are dense but contain significant water content, so they have a density near about 0.7-0.8 g/ml. Visual count suggests around 50-60 berries in the bowl. Given the size and density, the total weight can be estimated by volume: a 10 cm diameter bowl filled approximately 4-5 cm deep gives a volume about 314 ml (πr²h with r=5 cm, h=4 cm). Multiplying by density roughly 0.75 g/ml gives around 235 g. Considering some empty space between berries, we reduce by about 20%, resulting in circa 190 grams. This aligns with typical volume and size observed. Therefore, an estimate of approximately 190 grams for the blueberries in this bowl is reasonable and consistent with the visible cues."

Each piece of toast is roughly square, approximately 9 cm by 9 cm based on plate size comparison and typical bread slice dimensions. The thickness of each slice appears standard for pre-sliced bread, about 1.5 cm thick. Toast density is close to that of bread, which is moderately light but denser than airy items. Each slice looks fully toasted but not overly thick or dense. The two slices together roughly correspond to two small sandwich bread slices. A typical slice of standard bread weighs about 30-35 grams. Two slices together would be approximately 60-70 grams. No significant additional toppings (other than fromage frais spread) affect the 'toast' weight itself. The fromage frais spread weight is excluded as instructed. Hence, a precise estimate for the 'toast' (two slices) is about 65 grams. This aligns well visually and proportionally with the plate and knife size without over or underestimation."

Visually, there are about seven whole raspberries visible, each approximately 2.5 to 3 cm in length and about 2 cm in diameter. Comparing their size to the strawberries and the slice of bread, the raspberries seem like typical medium-sized raspberries. The average weight of a medium raspberry is around 4 to 5 grams. Calculating per piece, about 4.5 grams times 7 raspberries gives approximately 31.5 grams. Considering slight variations in size and possible compression, an estimate close to 30 grams is reasonable. This weight is consistent with the size of the fruits relative to the bread slice and strawberries on the plate, which are also medium-sized."

The food item to estimate is ""graine de chia"" (chia seeds). From the image, the chia seeds are integrated within a mixture in the jar that contains yogurt, oats, oat bran, honey, almond puree, and visible chia seeds. The jar is about the size of a small to medium glass jar, approximately 8 cm in diameter and 8-9 cm in height, filled almost completely with the mixture. Chia seeds appear as small black dots dispersed throughout the mixture. The chia seeds do not form a separate pile, but are mixed evenly with the other ingredients. Chia seeds are dense but typically only make up a small fraction of the mixture volume compared to yogurt and oats. Judging visually, the chia seeds likely compose about 5-7% of the total volume of the mixture. Assuming a total mixture weight of about 250 grams (common for this jar size filled with yogurt and thick ingredients), 5-7% chia seeds by weight corresponds roughly to 12-18 grams. Also, the top visible cluster of chia seems slightly denser around the honey and almond puree, though this doesn’t significantly increase total chia weight. Given these observations, I estimate the chia seeds weight to be approximately 15 grams. This estimate fits plausibly with the visible density and distribution in the jar relative to volume and other ingredients' expected densities."
p96w4a,mélasse,6.0,15.0,9.0,0.006656804733727811,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/b0979eb7-5126-4d9e-9058-64093ecde7e0,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'mélasse', which is clearly visible on the slice of bread in the top part of the plate. The slice of bread looks to be a typical size of about 12 cm in length and 6 cm in width, with a thickness around 2 cm. The mélasse appears to be spread thinly across roughly half the slice of bread. Considering the spread is semi-liquid and glossy, the thickness is quite thin, around 1-2 mm. Given that molasses (mélasse) is dense and sticky, weighing approximately 1.4 grams per ml, the volume here can be estimated roughly by multiplying the area (~72 cm² for half the bread slice) by the thickness (0.15 cm average). That results in roughly 10.8 cm³, which corresponds to about 15 grams of mélasse (since 1 cm³ equals 1 ml approximately). This estimate aligns with the portion visibly spread across the bread, neither too thick nor overly thin, and is consistent with a lightly spread layer of molasses used for breakfast. The bread slice size and spread thickness align well with this quantity, and this estimate is plausible given the overall scene and food context."
xjvrtk,séré maigre,145.0,136.0,9.0,0.16087278106508876,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/6d7c5913-406a-449c-a95d-dae1cff11f27,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'séré maigre', which is a type of low-fat fresh cheese similar to quark or cottage cheese. In the image, the mixture in the bowl contains séré maigre combined with graines de chia (chia seeds) and purée de noisettes (hazelnut puree). We need to estimate the weight of the 'séré maigre' portion specifically. Visually, the entire content of the bowl appears as a uniform creamy mixture with chia seeds dispersed throughout and some smooth texture indicating incorporation of hazelnut puree. The bowl size compared to the spoon handle suggests a medium-small bowl approximately 12-14 cm in diameter and about 5-6 cm deep. The mixture fills the bowl to roughly 2/3 depth. Based on the spoon size and visible texture, the approximate volume of the mixture is about 200 ml. The density of séré maigre is close to that of yogurt or soft cheese, about 1.0 to 1.1 g/ml, but here it is mixed with purée de noisettes (which is denser and fattier) and chia seeds (which are minor by volume but dense). Visually, the visible grains from chia seeds are well dispersed but overall the texture looks fluffy and creamy. Given the composition, the séré maigre likely constitutes roughly 60-70% of the total mixture by weight because purée de noisettes is thick and the rest are fine seeds. Estimating the total mix weighs about 210 grams (200 ml volume multiplied roughly by a density near 1.05), then 65% of this weight is séré maigre, equaling approximately 136 grams. This accounts for the physical volume observed, density differences, and proportion of ingredients based on appearance. This estimation aligns well with typical homemade mixes of this size in similar bowls."

The specified food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries). In the image, the blueberries are on the left side of the small plate, alongside strawberries and raspberries. The plate diameter seems to be around 15 cm (typical small dessert plate). Each blueberry has a diameter of about 1.5-2 cm based on visual comparison to the strawberries (which are about 4-5 cm in length). There are approximately 15 visible blueberries clustered together. Assuming an average blueberry weighs about 1.5 grams given their size and density (based on the visual scale and typical fruit density), the total weight is approximately 15 blueberries * 1.5 g = 22.5 g. This estimate fits well with the visual volume these blueberries occupy relative to the other fruits on the plate and the plate size. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'myrtilles' on the plate is about 22 grams."

The specified food item is 'poivron' (bell pepper), which is visible in the image as sliced red strips placed near the center of the plate. To estimate the weight, I compare the size of the poivron slices to nearby items. The slices are roughly half the length of the chicken pieces, which are about bite-sized chunks approximately 4-5 cm in length. The poivron slices are thin and appear lightly cooked, indicating relatively low density. The total volume of poivron slices corresponds to about a small handful. Considering their thinness and density, a reasonable estimate is that the poivron weighs around 50 grams. This is plausible given the plate size and portion sizes of other foods. The poivron is not piled high, so no upward adjustment is needed."

The specified food item is 'pain' (bread). In the image, there is a single slice of brown bread placed on a small black plate alongside two portions of tomato omelette. To estimate the bread's weight, I use the following visual cues: the bread slice nearly covers one half of the plate and is comparable in size to the two omelette portions. The bread slice is about 12 cm wide and 10 cm tall, with an average thickness of roughly 1.5 cm visible from its edges. The bread is artisanal or whole grain, with a porous but dense crumb. Estimating the bread's volume: approximately 12 cm x 10 cm x 1.5 cm = 180 cm³. Bread density typically ranges from 0.25 to 0.35 g/cm³; whole grain bread is usually denser, so we can take about 0.3 g/cm³ as a reliable estimate. Multiplying volume by density: 180 cm³ x 0.3 g/cm³ = 54 grams. This weight is reasonable given the bread slice's size relative to the plate and food portions. Therefore, the estimated weight of the bread slice shown in the image is about 54 grams."

The specified food item is 'salade de céleri,' which is the small mound of shredded white vegetable at the bottom right of the plate. Visually, it occupies roughly a similar surface area as the shredded carrot salad but is more compact and dense. The plate is a standard square plate approximately 25 cm wide. Using the potato salad slices (bottom left) and pieces of roasted chicken (top left) as size references, each portion seems moderate in size. The celery salad pile is roughly 7 cm by 5 cm in surface area and about 1.5-2 cm in height. The shredded texture suggests moderate density but less than cooked meat. Considering these dimensions, the estimated volume is about 50-70 cm³. Given the density of shredded celery mixed with dressing, a peak density of about 0.7 g/cm³ is reasonable. Thus, 60 cm³ × 0.7 g/cm³ = 42 grams. This aligns visually with the small portion size relative to the other foods. Therefore, an estimate around 40-45 g is accurate and plausible."

The specified food item is 'yaourt nature'. Observing the image, the yogurt is in a common single-serving plastic container, which is typical for plain yogurt portions in Switzerland and Europe. These cups usually contain around 125 grams of yogurt. The yogurt appears nearly full, with a smooth surface and no visible reduction in content. There is no indication that this yogurt is a larger or smaller size than standard. Unlike the apple, which size we consider for scale, the yogurt container is smaller in height, about half the height of the apple, supporting the idea it is a standard 125g cup. Given this, the weight estimate for the 'yaourt nature' here is confidently 125 grams."

The specified food item is pizza, of which there is a single visible small slice on the plate. The slice appears to be about one-eighth of a standard 25 cm diameter pizza, estimated by comparing the size of the slice to the plate diameter (which is typically about 25 cm). The slice has a thick crust, tomato sauce, cheese, and several visible mushrooms as toppings. The crust thickness is about 1.5 cm, and the slice length is around 8 cm with a width at the crust of about 7 cm, tapering towards the tip. Considering the density and toppings, the volume can be roughly estimated as length x average width x thickness = 8 cm x 5 cm (average width) x 1.5 cm = 60 cubic cm. Cooked pizza dough and toppings have a typical density around 0.8 g/cm3. Multiplying 60 cubic cm by 0.8 g/cm3 results in approximately 48 grams. Given visible toppings and the thickness, slight rounding upwards to account for cheese and mushrooms is reasonable, resulting in a final estimate around 50 grams. This aligns with the visual cues on the plate and relative size to the fork and plate. Therefore, the estimated weight of this pizza slice is 50 grams."

The food item specified is 'beurre' (butter), visible on two slices of bread on a white plate. Each slice has a visible butter spread: on one slice mixed with 'mélasse', and on the other slice with Nutella. The butter layer is thin, unevenly spread, and covers roughly 40-50% of each slice's surface area. The bread slices appear to be standard rustic slices roughly 12 cm long and 6-7 cm wide with moderate thickness. A thin butter layer on one slice of this size usually weighs about 5-7 grams. Since there is butter on two slices with similar thin coverage, the total butter weight is approximately 10-14 grams. Considering the spread is light and not thick, a precise estimate would be around 12 grams total butter on both slices combined. This figure is consistent and plausible given the visible spread and the size of the bread slices on the plate relative to their visible surroundings. Therefore, the estimated weight of the specified food item 'beurre' is 12 grams."

The image shows exactly one Kinder chocolate bar, visually confirmed by its distinctive segmented shape and white and milk chocolate pattern. The bar is positioned on a wooden surface, allowing us to compare its size relative to the wood grain and the typical width of a wooden plank. The bar appears to be around 10 cm long and about 2 cm wide, similar to the size of a standard Kinder Chocolate bar. Since the item is a processed and packaged chocolate bar of a known type, it is appropriate to rely on known standard weight for this product. A standard Kinder Chocolate bar weighs approximately 15 grams. Given the visible size and no signs of missing pieces, the entire bar weighs around 15 grams. This estimate is consistent with the visual scale and the known product packaging. Therefore, the estimated weight for the ""barre de chocolat kinder"" shown here is 15 grams."

The specified food item is 'carotte'. Visually, the carrots are sliced into rounds of approximately 1.5 cm thickness each. There are 13 visible carrot pieces on the plate. The average diameter of a carrot slice looks about 3.5 cm. Carrots have a density close to water (about 1 g/cm³) due to their high water content. Approximating each carrot slice as a cylinder: volume per slice = π × radius² × height = 3.14 × (1.75 cm)² × 1.5 cm ≈ 14.4 cm³. Since density ~1 g/cm³, each slice weighs about 14.4 g. Multiplying by 13 slices gives about 187 g. Cross-referencing with the plate size and comparison to the adjacent quinoa bulgur mix volume, this estimate fits reasonably well, as the carrots take roughly the same area or slightly more. Therefore, 187 g is a precise and plausible estimate."

The specified food item is 'pain bis' which is the bread. There are two slices of brown bread visible, roughly hand-sized. Comparing the bread slice to the hand holding it, the width is about 8-9 cm, length about 12-14 cm, with a typical thickness for a standard sliced loaf of about 1.2 cm. The bread has visible porous texture indicating a whole grain density, which is lighter than denser white bread, but still moderately dense. Typically, bread of this size weighs roughly between 30 and 45 grams per slice. Given the thickness and visual density, and that the slices are medium thickness (not too thin or thick), I estimate each slice is about 40 grams. Since both slices are shown and presumably forming the sandwich, but only one slice is specified, I will report the weight of one slice. Therefore, estimated weight for one 'pain bis' slice is approximately 40 grams. This is plausible as it matches visual size relative to the hand and other objects (the cornichons and cheese slices) in the image."

The specified food item is ""pain"", which is a slice of bread. The image shows a single slice of white bread on a large white plate. The bread slice has a typical size for sandwich or table bread, approximately 10 cm in diameter (slightly round slice). The thickness appears standard, about 1.5 to 2 cm, judging by the edge of the crust and the crumb visible. Bread density is moderate; typical white bread density is roughly 0.25 grams per cubic centimeter. Calculating approximate volume: assuming a circular slice of 10 cm diameter and 1.7 cm thickness, the volume is about π * (5 cm)^2 * 1.7 cm = about 134 cm³. Multiplying by bread density: 134 cm³ * 0.25 g/cm³ = 33.5 grams. This aligns well with typical single slice bread weights, which usually range around 30-40 grams depending on thickness and density. Since the slice is not visibly very thick or dense (no heavy grain), 33 grams is a precise and reasonable estimate. Therefore, the weight of the ""pain"" (bread) slice in the image is 33 grams."
2ahgvr,crème de marrons,13.0,8.0,5.0,0.008012820512820512,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/6b1cc73c-e22b-4132-970e-e37910b8b407,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The food item to estimate is 'crème de marrons' (chestnut cream) spread on a piece of bread ('pain'). By observing the image, the piece of bread is relatively small, roughly the size of a thumb or slightly larger, about 7-8 cm in length and approximately 3-4 cm wide at its widest part. The thickness of the bread slice is about 1.5-2 cm. The bread seems light and airy, typical for this type of sliced bread. The 'crème de marrons' layer is spread in a fairly thin but visually even layer, approximately 2-3 millimeters thick, covering the surface in a single layer without thick dollops. Estimating the approximate volume of the chestnut cream: Bread surface area ~ 7 cm x 3.5 cm = 24.5 cm²; Thickness of spread = 0.25 cm; Volume ~ 24.5 cm² x 0.25 cm = 6.1 cm³. Chestnut cream is dense but soft, with a density close to a jam or thick syrup, roughly around 1.3 g/cm³. Multiplying volume by density: 6.1 cm³ x 1.3 g/cm³ = approximately 7.9 grams. Checking for plausibility, a thin spread of sweet chestnut cream on a small piece of bread logically falls under 10 grams. Thus, the best estimate for the weight of 'crème de marrons' visible here is about 8 grams."

The specified food item is 'salami,' which is located on the right side of the plate as several small slices. Each slice appears to be about 2.5 to 3 cm in diameter and roughly 2-3 mm thick, judging by comparison to the radishes (which are roughly 3-4 cm in diameter) and the bread slice. There are six visible slices, including some broken pieces. Salami is a dense, cured meat product with visible pieces of fat, so its density is higher than vegetables but slightly less than lean meat. Each slice looks thin and relatively small in volume. Estimating the volume per slice roughly as a cylinder (diameter 2.7 cm, thickness 0.25 cm), the volume per slice is about 1.43 cm³. Considering the density of cured salami is approximately 1.2 g/cm³, each slice weighs about 1.7 grams. Multiplying by six slices, total weight is about 10 grams. This estimate is consistent with the visual portion relative to the rest of the plate: the salami pile is small and occupies little space compared to the bread and ham. There is limited thickness and no stacking, confirming a light portion. Therefore, 10 grams is a precise and plausible weight estimate for the salami portion shown."

The specified food item is 'oeuf' (egg). In the image, there is one half of a boiled egg visible on the plate. The egg half shows a somewhat firm yolk and white. A standard medium boiled egg in Switzerland typically weighs around 50 grams whole. Since only half an egg is present, the weight should be about half of that. Comparing the egg half to nearby items such as the cherry tomatoes and pieces of peach, the size is consistent with a single medium egg cut in half. No evidence suggests the egg is larger or smaller than average. Therefore, the weight of the visible half egg should be approximately 25 grams. This estimation is plausible given the overall plate size and distribution of food items."

Each tomato quarter is roughly 3-4 cm long, and they look fresh and juicy with visible seeds and some internal pulp. Using the plate diameter (approximately 25 cm) as a scale reference, these pieces are moderately sized. Typical fresh tomato density is close to water, about 1 g/cm3. Each quarter likely weighs around 15-20 grams, estimated by visual comparison of volume. Total for the two pieces is therefore about 30-35 grams. Considering moisture and some slight variance, a precise estimate is 32 grams. This fits well visually relative to the other ingredients on the wrap, and the total tomato portion looks small but sufficient to cover part of the wrap surface in two pieces. No excess or hidden tomato mass is visible."

The specified food item is 'salade de pâtes.' The pasta salad is located at the bottom left part of the plate, characterized by spiral pasta mixed with visible pieces of vegetables like corn, tomatoes, and green pepper. The plate appears to be a standard main course plate, roughly 25-27 cm in diameter. Using the plate rim and the size of the other items (a sausage and duck filet) for scale, the pasta salad portion takes up approximately a quarter of the plate's central area. The pasta pieces appear to be closely packed but not overly dense, with some air gaps due to the chopped vegetables. Visually, the volume corresponds roughly to a small medium-sized portion. Each spiral pasta piece seems to be about 1.5-2 cm in length and about 0.5-0.7 cm in diameter. The overall pile is roughly 6 cm wide, 5 cm long, and about 1.5 cm thick. This gives a volume around 45 cubic cm approximately. Cooked pasta density is about 1 g per cm^3 approximately, and the presence of mixed vegetables slightly lowers the density but since the vegetables are small chopped pieces mixed in, the net density remains close to that of cooked pasta. Comparing to the sausage at about 80-100 g and the duck filet portions around 50-80 g each, the pasta salad portion appears to weigh less than the sausage but more than a small vegetable side. Based on these observations, a precise estimation for this portion of 'salade de pâtes' is around 70 grams."

The image shows a small piece of demi croissant with visible butter and apricot jam. The demi croissant piece appears to be about half or slightly less than half of a typical half-croissant size, judging by the crumbs on the plate and the overall size relative to the plate rim. A typical demi croissant weighs roughly 25-30 grams. Since this piece is roughly half of a demi croissant, the weight of the pastry alone is approximately 12-15 grams. Adding the thin layers of butter and apricot jam, which likely add about 3-5 grams combined, the total weight should be around 15-20 grams. To be precise, given the small size and light spreads, an estimate of 17 grams is reasonable and consistent with the visual cues in the image and the plate size."

The specified food item is ""graines de chia"" (chia seeds), which are visibly mixed into a bowl containing blanc battu, flocons d'avoine, and miel. The bowl is a standard small to medium-sized white ceramic bowl, roughly 14-16 cm in diameter, and the mixture fills about half the interior depth. The chia seeds are dispersed throughout the mixture, appearing as small black dots with modest density. Visual volume of the chia seeds alone is only a fraction of the mixture because they are mixed with white dense blanc battu and oat flakes. From visual clues, the chia seeds make up roughly about 5-10% of the total mixture by volume. The bowl contains approximately 150-180 g of the whole mixture based on size comparison with the bowl and typical contents density. Chia seeds are very dense and small, so even a thin scattered layer contributes a meaningful yet small weight. Estimating the total volume and proportion helps to approximate chia seeds weight at about 8-12 g. Taking a balanced midpoint due to distribution and visible seed density, we estimate around 10 grams of chia seeds are present in the bowl."
m4egh2,biscuit,8.0,10.0,2.0,0.0019723865877712033,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/5350f0cd-e92a-44fc-9770-13b4bcca327e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'biscuit,' which is visible as the thin, irregularly shaped pieces placed on top of the ice cream in the glass. To estimate its weight, I first note the relative size: the biscuit pieces are about the width of the ice cream scoop, approximately 5-6 cm long and about 3-4 cm wide at their widest, but quite thin, around 2-3 mm thickness. Considering the biscuit's composition, which appears light and crunchy (possibly a wafer or crisp cookie), it will have a low density compared to denser baked goods. The biscuit covers a small surface area and is somewhat broken or fragmented, suggesting a volume of roughly 25-30 cm³ in total. Given the low density and thinness, a reasonable density estimate would be around 0.3 to 0.5 grams per cm³. Multiplying volume by density leads to an estimated weight of approximately 7 to 12 grams. Cross-checking with the overall dessert size and comparison to the ice cream scoops and meringue piece supports this low single-digit to low double-digit gram estimate. Therefore, the biscuit weight is most reasonably estimated around 10 grams."
xjvrtk,glace noisette,48.0,50.0,2.0,0.011834319526627219,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/76d985ce-8fcc-4832-b51f-25c40d637743,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'glace noisette' (hazelnut ice cream). It is served as a single scoop or a portion in a small bowl. The bowl has a diameter of roughly 12 to 15 cm, based on standard bowl sizes and the visible table surface around. The ice cream portion covers about one third to half the bowl’s bottom surface and has a moderate height of about 3 to 4 cm. Considering the texture and shadows, the ice cream is dense and compact but slightly aerated, typical for hazelnut ice cream. Comparing with the bowl size, the volume of ice cream looks approximately 75 to 90 milliliters. Given ice cream density is roughly 0.55 to 0.65 g/ml depending on air incorporation and fat content, we can estimate weight. Using a median density of 0.6 g/ml for hazelnut ice cream, the weight would be about 75 ml x 0.6 g/ml = 45 g to 90 ml x 0.6 g/ml = 54 g. Visual cues do not suggest a larger or smaller portion, and this estimate fits the scene logically (not overly large or small portion). Therefore, a precise estimate for this glace noisette portion is about 50 grams."
p96w4a,flocon d'avoines,13.0,15.0,2.0,0.003205128205128205,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/c0fc63a2-21db-448b-875a-c736a595bd0a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a white bowl with two types of seeds or grains measured out side by side. The specified food item is 'flocon d'avoines' (oat flakes), the lighter colored flakes on the right side of the bowl. The bowl's diameter appears to be a standard small cereal bowl size, likely around 15 cm across. The oat flakes occupy roughly half the bottom surface of the bowl, spread in a relatively thin, loose layer with some rough volume. The flakes are quite small and thin, but their volume is somewhat compact, with little air space compared to bulkier foods like leafy greens. The depth of the oat flakes appears around 3-4 mm on average based on the visible thickness and shadow. Comparing the flakes to the adjacent flax seeds on the left, which are smaller and denser, the flakes have a larger apparent volume but lower density. Given these observations and typical densities of dry oat flakes as visually confirmed, the amount in the bowl is approximately around 15 grams. This aligns with a volume estimate of roughly 15-18 milliliters and typical oat flake density near 0.6-0.7 g/ml. This estimate fits plausibly with the bowl size and flake spread, without overestimating thickness or density."
2ahgvr,salade de pâtes,112.0,110.0,2.0,0.027613412228796843,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a1dcaa3e-bad0-4d16-a8e3-c6217544e407,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small amount of pasta salad remaining on a plate. The plate is a regular-sized dinner plate, approximately 25 cm in diameter, which helps gauge the size of the food portion. The pasta pieces (penne) are about 3-4 cm each. There are roughly about 15 penne pieces visible plus some small pieces broken or partially hidden, scattered around. The salad also contains small pieces of corn and halved cherry tomatoes, which suggests some volume expansion but low density additions. The pasta appears lightly coated with dressing or seasoning, not heavily sauced, so density is moderately packed. Observing the visible portion, it looks like roughly a small snack or side portion rather than a full serving. The total volume of the pasta pieces roughly amounts to about 60-70 milliliters. Given cooked pasta density is about 160 g per 100 ml (less dense than raw dry pasta due to cooking water absorption), this would weigh around 100 to 110 grams. Considering the small volume but presence of corn and tomatoes adds a bit more weight, estimated total weight rounds to about 110 g. This is a plausible estimate relative to the plate size and food appearance. Therefore, the weight of the salad de pâtes shown is about 110 grams."
8japfq,épinards frais,52.0,50.0,2.0,0.01282051282051282,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/b233fd7c-865a-4287-818f-8d4fe868585e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'épinards frais' (fresh spinach). The spinach leaves are visible as a fresh leafy green bed beneath the tomatoes, sprouts, and falafels in the bowl. The bowl appears medium-sized and is filled around halfway with the spinach leaves, which are flat and not densely packed. Comparing to the tomatoes cerises (cherry tomatoes), which are roughly 3-4 cm long, and the falafels, roughly 3 cm in diameter each, the spinach covers a surface of about 12 cm by 12 cm and appears approximately 1-2 cm thick given the visible layering and the partial overlap beneath other items. Fresh spinach has a low density but with undisturbed leaves, a rough volume estimate is about 150-200 cm³. Given the typical density of fresh spinach at about 0.2 to 0.3 grams per cm³, the weight would be around 30-60 grams. Because the leaves seem moderately dense and not too compressed, a middle estimate around 50 grams is reasonable and consistent with the volume observed and portion size relative to other foods in the bowl."
wrah5h,mozzarella,54.0,53.0,1.0,0.006656804733727811,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1550c506-8c95-461f-b658-8f427dc2a0af,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'mozzarella'. Visually, the mozzarella is a single dollop placed on top of the pasta on a standard-sized dinner plate. The plate diameter can be roughly estimated to be about 25-28 cm based on the fork and knife, which are standard utensils approximately 18-20 cm long, placed next to the plate. The pasta portion alongside the mozzarella appears to take roughly a third of the plate's diameter in width, confirming the plate size. The mozzarella portion is about 6-7 cm wide at its broadest and appears moderately thick, approximately 3-4 cm. The mozzarella is fresh and creamy in texture, which is less dense than hard cheese, with an approximate density close to fresh cheese at about 1 g/cm³. Estimating volume as an irregular mound approximately 6 cm x 5 cm x 3.5 cm (an ellipsoid-like shape), volume approximates 6*5*3.5 * 0.5 (for ellipsoid shape factor) = 52.5 cm³. Given the density close to 1 g/cm³, the mozzarella would weigh approximately 50-55 grams. Cross-checking visually, this seems plausible considering the pasta amount and the relative size in the plate portion. Therefore, the best estimate for the weight of the mozzarella on this plate is 53 grams."

The specified food item is ""avocat"" (avocado). The avocado is present as two visible slices on the top half of the wrap. Using the plate as a reference (standard plate diameter roughly 24–26 cm), the wrap appears to be about 22 cm in diameter, and the avocado slices are approximately 6–7 cm long and about 2–3 cm wide. The slices are about 1–1.5 cm thick. Considering avocado density and volume, the avocado portion shown is modest but enough to cover part of the wrap. Combined thickness and volume suggest a weight around 40 grams. This aligns with typical avocado slice weights, adjusted visually for size, thickness, and density relative to others on the plate. The avocado is not overly thick or piled up, so the estimate avoids overestimation."
p8a2w5,barre de chocolat kinder,21.0,20.0,1.0,0.0025887573964497044,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/0845ef8b-a437-4236-a4f5-49280aac5c51,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'barre de chocolat kinder,' which is a Kinder chocolate bar. There are six of these bars mentioned in the list, but only one is visible in the image. The bar appears to be a single Kinder Bueno or a Kinder bar segment, roughly 10 cm long based on the visible wood grain sizes of the table and common proportions. The bar is thin, probably about 1.5 cm thick and 2 cm wide. Kinder chocolate bars of this type generally weigh around 15 to 25 grams per piece, and given the size and thickness observed in the image, it's reasonable to estimate it near the lower-middle of this range. Considering the visual cues and typical density of chocolate bars, a weight of approximately 20 grams for this single bar segment is appropriate. The image does not show packaging to confirm a known exact product weight, but the appearance and size correspond closely to standard small Kinder bars. Therefore, the estimated weight based on the visible size and common packaging is 20 grams."
ppf8hc,parmesan,14.0,15.0,1.0,0.0017258382642998027,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/2833b10a-52c7-409b-ad86-f6147c323f9e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'parmesan'. In the image, there is a plate with a serving of risotto aux asperges et parmesan. The parmesan appears to be grated and mixed into the risotto, visible as a light creamy coating that slightly binds the rice grains. There is no separate, visible chunk or slice of parmesan cheese. Thus, the parmesan weight must be inferred as part of the risotto mixture rather than as a separate piece. Considering the volume of risotto on the plate, which occupies a medium-small scoop approximately 8-10 cm across and 2-3 cm high, and recognizing parmesan's low bulk density when grated, the parmesan is likely a modest amount added primarily as flavoring. Typically, such a serving of risotto may contain between 10-20 grams of parmesan cheese to provide flavor but not overwhelm the dish. Given the visible coating and apparent distribution, an estimate on the lower mid side, about 15 grams, is reasonable. This respects that the cheese is a complement ingredient mixed in, not a main bulk item. The weight is also plausible relative to the overall risotto volume and typical portion sizes for parmesan as garnish and flavoring in risotto."
p8a2w5,beurre,5.0,6.0,1.0,0.000616370808678501,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/9e3bfdbf-2b6e-41be-93ee-6610250b8c4e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'beurre' (butter), which is on the plate as a small chunk of pale yellow fat. Visually, it appears to be a small pat of butter roughly sliced or scooped, located near the bottom right of the plate beside the two small toasted bread slices. Comparing the size of the butter portion to the bread pieces, which are about 10 cm long by approximately 3 cm wide and typically around 20-30 grams each if toasted bread, the butter is much smaller and thinner. The butter piece is about 4-5 cm long, 2 cm wide, and appears to be about 0.7 cm thick. Butter density is around 0.911 g/cm³, so volume estimate: 4.5 cm * 2 cm * 0.7 cm = 6.3 cm³. Calculate weight: 6.3 * 0.911 ≈ 5.7 grams. Considering the irregular shape and some slight overestimation of thickness, rounding to about 6 grams is reasonable. This weight aligns well with typical small pats of butter served with bread in European meals and matches the visual volume relative to other food items on the plate. Therefore, the estimated weight of the butter is about 6 grams."
xjvrtk,huile de lin,8.0,7.0,1.0,0.0009861932938856016,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/d15f25db-272a-4f8a-a0ae-225438cf4b70,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'huile de lin' (linseed oil). In the image, no visible bottle or container of oil is seen, nor is there any noticeable pooling or pouring of oil visible on the plate. Typically, linseed oil is used as a dressing or drizzle in small amounts due to its strong flavor and high fat density. Considering the size of the plate and the visible food portions, if linseed oil was applied, it would likely be a thin coating or a light drizzle roughly equivalent to 5-10 ml maximum. Since 1 ml of oil roughly equals 0.92 grams, 5 ml corresponds to about 4.6 grams, and 10 ml to about 9.2 grams. Given the absence of visible pooling or thick oil layers, a conservative mid-point estimate of about 7 grams is reasonable. This fits plausibly as a light dressing weight in the context of the visible food items, without appearing excessive or unexplainable visually."

The specified food item is 'beurre' (butter), which is spread on a single slice of braided bread (tresse) with apricot jam (confiture abricot). The plate diameter can be roughly estimated as a standard dessert plate around 20-22 cm. The slice of bread covers about one-fifth of the plate diameter (approximately 4-5 cm wide). The butter spread is thin but covers most of the slice beneath the jam. Judging by the thin layer and typical density of butter, I estimate the butter coverage here to be about 3-4 grams. The butter layer is not thick; it is a light spread. A thicker spread of about 1-2 mm thickness over the slice roughly translates to around 3.5 grams for this portion size. This estimate is more accurate than generic average since the bread slice size is directly visible, and the butter layer is quite thin and spread evenly. Therefore, the most precise estimate for the butter weight on this slice is about 3.5 grams."

The specified food item to estimate is 'beurre' (butter). The butter piece is located on the upper right side of the plate. It is a rectangular small chunk, approximately 3 cm long, 1 cm wide, and 1 cm thick, based on the nearby fork and knife for scale. Butter has a density close to 0.9 g/cm³. The volume is about 3 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm = 3 cm³. Multiplying volume by density (3 cm³ × 0.9 g/cm³) gives approximately 2.7 g. Considering possible slight errors in thickness or length, rounding to the nearest whole number is appropriate. This small portion is consistent visually with a typical butter serving piece on a plate, and compares well in size relative to the bread slice and cheese pieces, confirming the estimation is plausible."
xjvrtk,œuf dur,50.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/b53715cb-f3f5-4abf-bd1d-b7264f7f0a86,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The œuf dur (hard boiled egg) is clearly visible on the left side of the plate, cut into two halves. By comparing the œuf dur with the fork and knife next to the plate, which are standard sized utensils, the egg halves appear roughly the size of a typical chicken egg. The yolk and white texture also look normal for a fully cooked hard boiled egg, and the two halves represent one whole egg. A standard hard boiled egg weighs approximately 50 grams when peeled. Given the Swiss context, eggs are typically medium-sized, so 50 grams is a reasonable precise estimate based on the visual cues and utensil scale. No excess or missing parts are visible, so no adjustment needed. Therefore, the weight of the œuf dur present in the image is estimated accurately at 50 grams."
