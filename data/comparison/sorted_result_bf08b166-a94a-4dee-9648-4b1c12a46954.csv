The specified food item is 'œuf dur' (hard-boiled egg). In the image, there are two halves of a single hard-boiled egg, making it one whole egg. A standard medium-sized hard-boiled egg weighs approximately 50 grams, including the yolk and white. The egg appears to be of average size, and there is no indication of it being unusually large or small. Therefore, the estimated weight of the œuf dur is 50 grams."
