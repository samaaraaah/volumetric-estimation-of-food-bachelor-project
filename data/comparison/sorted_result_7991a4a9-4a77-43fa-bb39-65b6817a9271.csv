xjvrtk,tomates cerises,500.0,250.0,250.0,15.193873830071714,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/5ccbcf64-3631-48df-9e8a-85fb33dbf912,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a cardboard container filled with cherry tomatoes ('tomates cerises') still attached to their vine. The container appears to be full, and the tomatoes are small, round, and densely packed. Based on the size of the container and the density of the tomatoes, I estimate the total weight of the cherry tomatoes, including the vine, to be approximately 250 grams. This estimation considers the typical weight of cherry tomatoes and the visible volume in the container."

The image shows a pizza with visible toppings of mushrooms (champignons), olives, and zucchini (courgettes). The pizza is cut into five slices, with some slices showing more toppings than others. The pizza appears to be a thin-crust style, which is less dense than thicker crusts. Based on the size of the slices and the visible toppings, I estimate the total weight of the pizza to be around 400-500 grams. Since the pizza is partially eaten, I estimate the remaining portion to be about 70% of the total pizza. This would make the remaining weight approximately 280-350 grams. Considering the toppings and crust, I estimate the weight of the pizza champignons, olives, courgettes to be 320 grams."
