The image shows a blue bowl containing about 14 pieces of fresh pineapple ('ananas') cut into triangular chunks. Each piece appears to be roughly 3 to 5 cm in length, with medium thickness typical for fresh pineapple. Pineapple is a dense fruit with high water content, and a typical chunk of this size weighs around 30 to 40 grams. Multiplying by the number of pieces (14), I estimate a total weight range between 420 and 560 grams. Considering some pieces may be smaller and some larger, a good median estimate would be roughly 480 grams. This aligns well with the visible portion size and bowl depth, confirming the estimation's plausibility."
xjvrtk,cidre,500.0,280,220.0,4.751004189521876,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/62c48fc7-a443-4018-9e30-62ecd36ead23,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a transparent glass filled with a golden liquid identified as 'cidre' (cider). The glass is a typical drinking glass, about the size of a standard Swiss bar glass, which commonly holds between 250 to 300 ml. The cider fills almost to the brim. Given that the density of cider is close to that of water, 1 ml is approximately 1 gram. Therefore, the weight of the cider contained in the glass can be estimated as the volume in ml. Considering the glass is quite full, this suggests a weight between 260 and 300 grams. Taking a middle ground estimate for this portion, the weight of the cidre in the glass is approximately 280 grams."
p96w4a,délice tomate mozzarella,54.0,265,211.0,0.49211765214011144,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/5ebafbd6-315d-44a6-8508-ba143d23adb2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The 'délice tomate mozzarella' consists of alternating slices of tomato and mozzarella arranged in a layered manner with balsamic vinegar and herbs sprinkled on top. The layers appear to be about 6 tomato slices and 6 mozzarella slices, each about the size of a small to medium tomato slice. A typical medium tomato slice weighs roughly 20 grams, and a slice of fresh mozzarella of similar size weighs approximately 25 grams due to its density and moisture content. Multiplying, 6 slices of tomato at 20g each is about 120g, and 6 slices of mozzarella at 25g each is about 150g, totaling about 270g. Considering some variability in slice thickness and arrangement, and the plating that does not display extra hidden depth, a weight range of 250-280 grams is reasonable. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'délice tomate mozzarella' is approximately 265 grams."
r3bub9,risotto aux asperges,305.0,100,205.0,2.7005139722714118,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/r3bub9/dish_media/207070c9-c6dd-4cf9-b0a7-5979b06babc3,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small portion of risotto aux asperges (asparagus risotto) on a relatively large plate. The risotto grains are visible and sparse, with only a few pieces of asparagus present. Given the limited amount spread over the plate and noting that risotto is a dense, creamy dish that can weigh more than it looks at first glance, this portion appears to be a small serving, likely a side portion or a small plate leftover. Considering the portion size relative to the plate and the density of the dish, a plausible weight range would be around 80 to 120 grams. Since the portion is modest but with some density from the rice and asparagus, I estimate the risotto aux asperges weighs approximately 100 grams."
wrah5h,betterave,65.0,270,205.0,0.5755193711398091,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/bba5cf64-1d08-40cb-bc6c-bfdd2a7c2116,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The betterave (beetroot) portion is located on the left upper side of the plate and consists of dark red cubes. There are about 15 medium-sized cubes, with each cube roughly 2-3 cm in size. Cooked beetroot is dense and moist, and a typical cube of this size weighs around 15-20 grams. Multiplying by 15 cubes gives a range of 225 to 300 grams. Given the portion is nicely piled but not overly full, the betterave portion looks medium-sized. Therefore, estimating near the middle of the range, about 270 grams is reasonable. This fits well with the plate's overall portion sizes compared to the other components like quinoa and avocado."
wrah5h,tofu à la mangue,80.0,260,180.0,0.6219496393555911,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/712f4686-2c54-47d3-a8f2-811e15f6e76b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a metal container with several food items neatly arranged. The tofu à la mangue is located in the left foreground as yellowish cubes with green herbs and small bits of chopped shallots on top. There are about 8-10 visible medium-sized cubes. Each tofu cube looks relatively dense and solid, roughly sized about 3 cm per side, and coated with a mango-flavored seasoning giving it a slightly moist texture. Considering tofu density and typical cube size, each piece likely weighs about 25 to 30 grams. Multiplying by the 8-10 pieces, the portion is likely between 200 to 300 grams. Given the portion fills about 1/5 to 1/6 of the container, and comparing that to the quinoa and other items, this estimate seems plausible. I estimate the tofu à la mangue weighs approximately 260 grams."

The image shows a white plate with cooked vegetables on the left side, consisting of Swiss chard stems and leaves (côtes de bette), beetroot chunks (betterave rouge), and visible pieces of carrot and fennel mixed in. The vegetables occupy roughly one-third of a standard-sized dinner plate. The mixture appears to be cooked and chopped, with some moisture visible indicating softness and slight reduction in volume from raw state. Swiss cooked chard, beetroot, carrots, and fennel are all relatively dense when cooked. The pile is moderately thick, around 2-3 cm high, and spread over an area roughly 10x8 cm. Considering density and volume, a medium portion of cooked mixed vegetables of this size typically weighs around 150-180 grams. Given the visual portion size and thickness, I estimate the cooked mixed vegetables (côtes de bette, betterave rouge, fenouil, carottes) weight to be approximately 165 grams."
xjvrtk,tomates cerises,500.0,340,160.0,3.455275774197728,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/5ccbcf64-3631-48df-9e8a-85fb33dbf912,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a rectangular paper tray filled with cherry tomatoes still attached to some green stems. There are approximately 20 cherry tomatoes visible, some deep red and some orange. A typical cherry tomato weighs about 15-20 grams on average depending on size and ripeness. Given the size comparison with the folded book and the tray, these tomatoes are medium-sized for their type. Assuming an average weight of about 17 grams per tomato and about 20 tomatoes present, the total weight is likely between 320 and 360 grams. Considering some variation and stems taking some volume but not weight, I estimate the total weight of the cherry tomatoes to be approximately 340 grams."

The image shows a bowl with two distinct items: omelette au persil on the upper side and a portion of côtes de bettes à la sauce tomate on the lower side submerged partially in sauce. The bowl appears to be medium sized, and the côtes de bettes portion occupies about one third of it. The leafy greens and stems are visibly softened and partially broken down in the sauce, typical for cooked Swiss chard stems and leaves with tomato sauce. Given the density of cooked vegetables and the volume they occupy, it is reasonable to estimate a weight range around 130-180 grams. The liquid content increases apparent volume but the weight remains moderate due to mostly vegetable matter and water. Based on these observations and avoiding underestimation of cooked vegetable dishes, I estimate the côtes de bettes à la sauce tomate portion in the bowl to weigh about 160 grams."
xjvrtk,courgette et oignons,300.0,165,135.0,1.7492333606875998,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a glass container divided roughly in two portions: on the left side, there is a cooked vegetable mixture of courgette (zucchini) and onions; on the right side, galettes made of millet, black beans, and corn. The courgette and onions appear to be chopped into chunks and cooked, with visible moisture indicating softness and some water retention. The container size looks like a small meal prep portion container, roughly 12 by 12 cm and about 3-4 cm deep. The courgette and onions cover about half the container, and the amount fills this half to a moderate thickness, around 2.5-3 cm depth likely. Cooked courgettes and onions have moderate density due to their water content, but still retain some bulk. Given the size and volume, I estimate this portion roughly at around 150 to 180 grams. Considering some variation and moisture content, I settle on a final weight estimate of about 165 grams for the courgette and onions portion."

The image shows a single slice of tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe on a plate. The slice appears to be about one quarter of a typical tarte flambée, with a thin crust base and a topping of diced rhubarb and apple pieces spread evenly. The thickness of the toppings is thin to moderate, and the slice size is about 15 cm by 15 cm approximately, judging by the plate size which is a standard dessert plate. Considering the light and airy nature of the rhubarb and apple, combined with the thin dough base, the density is moderate. A full tarte flambée typically weighs between 400-500 grams. This slice, being roughly a quarter, should weigh approximately 100-130 grams. Given the visual assessment and density, I estimate this slice weighs about 115 grams."

The fallafels are located on the right side of the plate and there are eight whole pieces visible. Each fallafel is about the size of a small golf ball, roughly compact and dense. A typical falafel ball of this size weighs roughly 30-35 grams. Given these are all whole and of similar size, the total weight of the fallafels should be around 240-280 grams. Considering the slightly varied size and the fact they appear well cooked but not overly dense, I estimate the total weight of the fallafels to be approximately 260 grams."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,290,127.0,2.2873493715717186,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate filled with a tomato salad ('salade de tomates'). The tomatoes are cut into wedges and cover the entire plate surface, appearing as a medium-sized portion typical for one person. The plate diameter relative to the knife and fork suggests a standard dinner plate, approximately 25 cm in diameter. Tomatoes have a relatively high water content but are dense enough that this volume corresponds to a tangible weight. Given the volume and density of the tomato pieces, and factoring in the visible balsamic vinegar and sprinkled flax seeds, the tomato portion likely weighs between 250 and 330 grams. Considering that the salad is quite full and the pieces are fairly thick, I estimate the weight at about 290 grams, balancing between minimum and maximum plausible weights."

The image shows a rectangular plastic container partially filled with a Greek salad. The salad consists of diced cucumber, tomato, yellow bell pepper, olives, onion rings, and small pieces of white cheese, all coated with a dressing. The container appears medium-sized, with the salad filling roughly one-third of the volume. Given the typical density of a Greek salad which includes mostly vegetables and some cheese, and the visible volume, the salad portion seems modest but not tiny. A medium portion of Greek salad in such a container typically weighs between 150 and 250 grams. Considering the salad occupies about one-third of the container, I estimate the portion weight around 180–200 grams, with a final estimate of 190 grams to reflect the visible amount and the mixed density of vegetables and cheese."

The image shows a ceramic bowl containing porridge and a dollop of almond purée on the side. The porridge fills roughly three-quarters of the bowl, and the almond purée is a small rounded spoonful. Considering the size of a typical small to medium ceramic bowl used for breakfast servings, the porridge portion looks to be about 150-180 grams. This takes into account density and volume of cooked oats that absorb water and swell, making the mass relatively heavy for its volume. Given the almond purée is not the target food, we do not count it. Based on these observations, a reasonable weight estimate for the porridge portion is approximately 165 grams, comfortably within a range of 150 to 180 grams."
2ahgvr,porridge salé,48.0,160,112.0,0.23219453202608734,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a35f3211-3b33-4826-97b8-3af69655dada,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small glass jar with a metal lid, containing savory porridge ('porridge salé'). The jar appears to be about 200 ml in volume given its dimensions compared to the car dashboard vents underneath. The porridge fills approximately 80% of the jar. Considering the porridge consists mostly of oats and liquid (likely milk or water), and knowing that cooked porridge has a density close to 1g/ml due to water content, the weight corresponds roughly to the filled volume. Estimating the jar's capacity at 200 ml, 80% full means about 160 ml of porridge. Since the density is close to water, this translates to about 160 grams. Allowing for some variation depending on exact moisture and ingredients, a reasonable plausible weight range is 150-170 grams. Choosing a final value near the center, I estimate the porridge salé weight to be 160 grams."

The image shows a rectangular glass container with two main visible foods: gnocchi au basilic and pieces of cooked cauliflower (chou-fleur) sprinkled with grated cheese (fromage râpé). The gnocchi are clearly visible, about 17 pieces approximately, each appearing to be of medium size, typical of gnocchi made with potato and enriched here with basil. Considering a standard gnocchi piece weighs approximately 10 to 12 grams, and these seem neither very small nor large, I estimate around 11 grams each. Multiplying by about 17 pieces gives a weight range of approximately 170 to 190 grams. Adjusting slightly for potential size variation between gnocchi (some might be smaller or larger), I estimate the total weight of gnocchi au basilic to be around 180 grams. The cauliflower pieces occupy a large area but are less dense and are not part of this estimate. Grated cheese is minimal and mostly on top. This weight estimate aligns with typical portion sizes and visual volume."

The image shows a bowl containing a creamy mixture of flocons d'avoine (oat flakes) soaked with a liquid, likely milk or yogurt, along with chia seeds mixed in. The volume of the oat mixture appears to be about half to two-thirds of a small to medium textured bowl. The texture and volume suggest it is a thick porridge-like consistency. Considering the density of soaked oats and chia seeds, and the approximate size relative to the plate held in one hand, the portion looks like a moderate serving. Typically, 40-50 grams of dry oats swell up to roughly 150-180 grams when soaked, and considering the visible volume here, a reasonable internal weight range might be 130-170 grams. Choosing a middle value to best fit the visible quantity, I estimate the weight of the flocons d'avoine portion at about 150 grams."

The specified food 'quinoa et boulgour au curry' is clearly visible as the filling inside a hollowed yellow bell pepper on a white plate. The quinoa and bulgur mixture appears cooked and seasoned with curry, giving it a yellow tint. The filling is compact and slightly piled above the rim of the pepper, which is medium-sized. Considering the appearance and typical density of cooked quinoa and bulgur, a full bell pepper stuffed this way usually contains roughly between 100 and 140 grams of the mixture. Given the fullness and some minor overflow, the portion looks medium-sized, so I estimate the weight toward the upper middle of this range. The pepper slices taken off the main body are separate and are not part of the weight estimation for the filling itself, but help confirm the size of the pepper. Thus, a plausible estimate for the quinoa and bulgur curry filling is about 130 grams."

The image shows a plate with three pieces of breaded fish fillets ('poissons panés'). Each piece is roughly rectangular, about the size of a typical fillet portion found in home meals or ready-to-cook products in Switzerland. Each fillet appears to be about 10-12 cm long, 4-5 cm wide, and of moderate thickness (about 1-1.5 cm). Breaded fish tends to be moderately dense and the breading adds some weight. Considering typical sizes and densities, one piece commonly weighs around 70-90 grams. With three pieces of similar size and thickness, the total weight would be approximately 210-270 grams. Given the visible portion and size, a reasonable estimate is at the mid-range, about 240 grams for all three pieces combined. Since the question asks for the estimate of 'poissons panés' as a food item, that refers to the total portion shown, i.e., the three fillets. Therefore, the estimated weight of the poissons panés on this plate is about 240 grams."

The gratin de côtes de bettes is located on the right side of the plate. It appears as a roughly circular portion with a creamy, slightly browned surface and visible leafy vegetable pieces underneath the gratin topping. The size is about half the diameter of the plate's visible food area. Considering a typical medium-sized French gratin portion and the density of cooked leafy greens combined with creamy sauce and cheese, the portion looks medium-sized and moderately dense. Comparing it to the pasta and steak végétarien portions, the gratin seems to weigh more than the vegetable Romanesco but less than a very large meat portion. A typical gratin portion of this size in Switzerland can range between 120g to 180g given the creamy and dense nature of the dish. Visual cues suggest the portion is complete and not a small remnant, so I settle on the mid to upper part of this range. Therefore, I estimate the gratin de côtes de bettes to weigh approximately 160 grams."

The image shows a whole galette wrap laid out flat with different ingredients arranged in the middle. The tofu à la mangue is visible as two rectangular slices at the bottom of the filling row. Considering the size of the wrap, which is approximately 20-25 cm in diameter based on typical wraps, the tofu pieces appear to be about 7-8 cm long and 3 cm wide each, with a thickness around 1.5-2 cm. Tofu generally has a density close to 1 g/cm³. Given the size of both pieces together, I estimate each piece to weigh around 60-70 grams, totaling around 120-140 grams. Considering some unevenness and possible mango pieces adding some density, but also some air gaps, I place the final estimate at 130 grams, within a plausible range of 120 to 140 grams. This estimate aligns well with the size relative to the other ingredients and the wrap itself."

The image shows a bowl with a visible mixture of pork and vegetables in a Thai style sauce, served on a bed of rice noodles. The bowl is medium-sized and filled about halfway with the mixture on top of the noodles. The pork pieces are cut into small chunks, and the vegetables include broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, peppers, peas, and eggplant pieces. Considering the volume and density of the pork and vegetables combined with the sauce, this mixture appears quite dense and moist. Given the typical portion size in Swiss context and the visible amount, I estimate the mixture weighs between 180 and 230 grams. Taking a midpoint with consideration for the portion being more than a small serving but not entirely full, I estimate the weight at approximately 210 grams."

The image shows four pieces of sweet potato waffles ('gaufre à la patate douce') topped with dollops of demi-crème acidulée and slices of smoked salmon. The waffles appear to be about 7-8 cm each side, roughly cut from a larger waffle. Each piece looks to be about 1.5-2 cm thick. Sweet potato waffles are dense due to the tuber content but still lighter than meat. The portions here appear moderate, not very large but definitely not a bite-sized piece. Considering the size and density, each piece likely weighs about 40-45 grams. With four pieces in total, the whole waffle portion is approximately 160-180 grams. Thus, for the entire 'gaufre à la patate douce' portion on the plate, I estimate about 170 grams. This accounts purely for the waffles without the toppings."

The image shows a serving of a mixed vegetable dish on a plate, containing diced pieces of potatoes, feta, carrots, parsnip (panais), eggplant, and beetroot (racines rouges). The parsnip pieces are visible as roughly 1-2 cm thick rectangular chunks, mixed evenly throughout the portion. The portion size on the plate is moderate, about a small to medium serving. Considering the density of cooked parsnip, which is fairly dense root vegetable, and the visible number of pieces (about 6-8 pieces), each piece roughly weighs about 10-15 grams. This gives a total in the range of 60-120 grams. Assessing the volume relative to other vegetables and the overall dish size, an estimate near the midpoint is appropriate. Thus, I estimate the weight of the parsnip portion in the image to be about 90 grams."
p96w4a,purée de pdt,214.0,140,74.0,0.6839718395024403,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/828972fc-fa12-4270-a960-fc59367fc91e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with a serving of purée de pdt (mashed potatoes), topped with chunks of viande ragoût (stewed meat), two pieces of carrot, and brown sauce spread over and around the food. The mashed potatoes are spread in a rectangular shape covering a significant part of the plate center, approximately 10 cm by 6 cm, with moderate thickness—likely about 2 to 3 cm. Mashed potatoes have a dense but slightly aerated texture. Using the plate diameter roughly as a scale of about 25-27 cm and comparing the size of the carrots and meat pieces, the mashed potatoes portion visually fits a medium serving. Considering typical density (about 0.9 g/cm3) and the portion volume estimation (roughly 10 cm x 6 cm x 2.5 cm = 150 cm3), the estimated weight for the purée de pdt is approximately 130-150 grams. I select the middle value given the portion looks moderate, so about 140 grams is a reasonable estimate."

The pork ('porc') piece is located in the lower left of the metal container, covered partially by a white sauce (crème, moutarde). It is a single, moderate-sized portion, about the size of a typical pork steak slice, appearing cooked and somewhat dense. By comparing it to the adjacent food items, including the portion of polenta topped with grated cheese on the right and the grilled eggplant slices above, the pork portion looks like a medium serving — not too thick, but substantial in size. A typical single portion of cooked pork meat is roughly between 100 and 150 grams. Given the visual size and thickness here, and that the sauce adds no additional weight, I estimate the pork to weigh around 125 grams, with a plausible range from 110 to 140 grams."
2ahgvr,asperges,177.0,250,73.0,0.5580702284801106,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/b24759a6-90ea-4f9e-a1ad-d52af234de62,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small bowl with white asparagus spears and a dollop of mayonnaise. There are about 9 spears visible, each around 10-12 cm long, fairly thick but not overly large. White asparagus tends to have a firm and fibrous texture with moderate water content. A typical single spear weighs approximately 25-30 grams. Given the 9 spears and assuming moderate density, this corresponds to an estimated total weight range between 225 grams (9 x 25 g) and 270 grams (9 x 30 g). The spears are loosely arranged without excessive layering. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the asparagus to be about 250 grams, which is well within the plausible range and matches the visual portion size."

The image shows a white bowl containing a creamy yogurt with visible apricot pieces. Given the size of the bowl and the amount of yogurt inside, it appears to be a moderate single serving portion. Typical industrial apricot yogurt pots in Switzerland usually weigh around 125 grams in total. The yogurt portion in the bowl looks approximately three-quarters full compared to a standard pot volume, so we can estimate a weight slightly below the full 125 grams. Taking into account the density and the distribution of apricot pieces, the weight likely lies between 90 and 110 grams. Choosing a median value informed by these observations, the estimated weight of the yogourt industriel à l'abricot avec morceaux is approximately 100 grams."

The image depicts a black plate holding two dessert portions: a tiramisu on the left and a forêt noir on the right. I focus on the tiramisu portion. It is a moderately sized slice with visible layers of soaked sponge and creamy mascarpone. The dimensions seem approximately 8 cm long, 4 cm wide, and about 3.5 cm high. This corresponds to a roughly rectangular slice. Considering the density of tiramisu, which is creamy yet soft, the weight per volume will be relatively dense but less than solid cake. A typical tiramisu of this size usually weighs between 120 and 160 grams. Given the moistness and some slight compression visible, I estimate the tiramisu slice shown to be around 140 grams. This is consistent with the nearby forêt noir portion which appears somewhat similar in mass on the plate, supporting the plausibility of this estimate."

The image shows a mostly finished plate with a small remaining portion of salade de pâtes. The pasta pieces are penne shaped, coated lightly with dressing or herbs, mixed with a few pieces of corn, small tomato chunks, and possibly bits of green vegetables and some diced ham or bacon. The portion left is visually small, roughly occupying a small puddle area in the center of a large plate, with approximately 12-15 penne pieces visible. Considering the size of penne pasta and the light mix of additional ingredients, the visible portion likely weighs around 40-50 grams. The appearance is of a small leftover portion rather than a full serving. Taking into account the volume, density and visual distribution, I estimate the weight of the salade de pâtes to be around 45 grams."

The image shows a small bowl containing whole cherry tomatoes, small mozzarella balls (bocconcini), and basil leaves. There are five mozzarella balls visible, each about the size of a cherry tomato but denser and heavier. Typically, small mozzarella balls of this size weigh around 20 grams each. Given their smooth texture and density, this estimate is reasonable. With five balls visible, the total weight is around 100 grams. Considering slight variations in size and some possible moisture, I estimate the mozzarella weight to be approximately 100 grams, with a plausible range between 90 and 110 grams."
ppf8hc,pâtes carbonara,236.0,170,66.0,0.6727421932362977,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/4d4e6539-b86f-4019-b2aa-0c15dbce0667,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate of pâtes carbonara topped with a noticeable pile of grated gruyère cheese. The pasta portion is moderate, spread out enough to cover a small-to-medium plate area. The pasta pieces appear cooked al dente with sauce and bacon bits, typical for carbonara, and the visible volume suggests a reasonable portion size. The grated gruyère cheese on top looks like a generous sprinkle, roughly the volume of a small handful of cheese granules. Considering that cooked pasta weighs less than it appears due to water content but is dense when sauced, the pasta sauce and bacon contribute density as well. A small to medium cooked pasta portion is usually around 150-200 grams without cheese. The grated gruyère cheese volume estimated visually corresponds to about 20-30 grams. Therefore, for the pâtes carbonara portion alone (excluding the cheese), the estimated weight is about 170 grams, with a plausible range of 150-190 grams. This makes sense relative to the plate size, visible pasta quantity, and cheese topping volume. I thus estimate the weight of the pâtes carbonara to be 170 grams."

The image shows a piece of 'délice des dieux,' which includes a biscuit base, a layer of mixed red fruits (fruits rouges), and a topping made of séré and mascarpone. The portion is a rectangular slice approximately 10 cm by 7 cm, with moderate thickness including the biscuit and creamy layers. The biscuit layer is dense and moist from fruit juices, while the creamy top is thick and smooth, and the few berries on top add slight weight. Considering the size and density, I estimate the weight to be in the range of 120-160 grams given the creamy, moist components that add weight beyond a dry biscuit cake slice. The portion is medium-sized, not very thin or overly thick, so choosing a midpoint value is logical. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this 'délice des dieux' slice to be approximately 140 grams."

The image shows two slices of toasted bread ('pain') on a white plate. The slices appear to be of medium thickness and typical size for Swiss bread, roughly 12-14 cm in length and about 1-1.5 cm thick. Toasted bread is lighter than fresh bread due to moisture loss but weight remains close. A standard slice of bread of this type generally weighs around 40-50 grams each. There are two slices, so the total weight of the 'pain' visible is approximately between 80 and 100 grams. Given the visual fullness and size, an estimate closer to 90 grams is reasonable for both slices combined. Because the prompt is asking for 'pain' (bread) weight, I assume the sum of both slices on the plate as a portion. Therefore, the estimated weight for the 'pain' is 90 grams."

The image shows a single round pancake on a medium-sized plate. The pancake has a golden-brown surface with a slightly darker edge. Typical pancakes in Switzerland are about 15 cm in diameter and about 1 to 1.5 cm thick. Given its size and thickness, a single pancake like this usually weighs between 80 and 110 grams. There is no visible extra topping or filling inside the pancake that would add to its weight significantly, so its density is standard for a cooked pancake. Considering this is a single pancake and looks a medium portion, I estimate the weight to be approximately 95 grams, which is comfortably in the center of the plausible range."

The specified food item is 'chili,' which is located on the right side of the plate. It consists of visible chunks of cervelas sausage, red kidney beans, and a tomato-based sauce. The chili covers roughly half of a standard-sized plate. Given the density of the beans and sausages, and the moist but thick sauce, the chili has a substantial weight. The portion is not overly heaped but moderately piled, so depth is medium. Comparing to the pasta on the plate which looks like about 150 grams, the chili portion appears slightly larger in volume but denser. A reasonable internal weight range is between 220 grams and 280 grams. Choosing a middle value considering the density and size, I estimate the chili portion weighs approximately 250 grams."

The brochette de boeuf is composed of three relatively large grilled beef chunks on a wooden skewer. Each chunk appears roughly the size of a large walnut or small chicken thigh piece, and the three are evenly sized. Considering the density of cooked beef and common Swiss portion sizes, each chunk likely weighs about 40-50 grams. Combining the three pieces gives a total estimated weight range of 120-150 grams. The other items on the plate such as the pasta salad and sausage help give scale; the brochette pieces are clearly chunks of meat and not overly thick or thin. Given this reasoning, I estimate the brochette de boeuf to weigh approximately 135 grams."

The image shows a half piece of 'tresse au beurre' (butter braid bread) on a square plate next to a rectangular piece of sliced gruyère cheese for scale comparison. The bread is of medium size, with a typical density for enriched bread. Considering the typical weight of a whole butter braid being around 250-300 grams, this visible portion is roughly one-third to one-half of a whole small loaf. Visually, the slice is thick and compact, corresponding to approximately 90-130 grams. Given the half loaf appearance and size, my plausible weight range is 90-130 grams. After checking plausibility against the dimensions and density compared to the nearby gruyère slice and plate surface area, an estimate of 110 grams is appropriate."

The image shows a small glass bowl containing a portion of chocolate yogurt. The yogurt appears soft and creamy with a swirled texture indicating it was likely spooned into the bowl. The bowl size is modest, and the yogurt fills it to about half or slightly more. Considering typical Swiss yogurt packaging and serving portions, a standard individual yogurt container contains about 125 grams. The amount here looks roughly a serving size or slightly less. Given the volume and density of typical chocolate yogurt, I estimate the weight of the yogurt here to be in the range of 110 to 130 grams, and a good precise estimate is around 120 grams."

The image shows a bowl containing a tomato soup with visible large chunks of tomato and some herbs sprinkled on top. The bowl appears to be a small to medium-sized bowl, and the soup fills it almost to the edge. Tomato soups are primarily liquid with some solid pieces; tomatoes are relatively dense but the soup itself has a high water content. Considering the volume of the bowl, which is roughly around 300-350 ml capacity, and the visible fullness, the total weight of the soup (mostly liquid) would be close to its volume in grams. Since there is some chunky tomato pieces, the density might be slightly higher than water, so I estimate between 320-370 grams. Taking a middle value for a medium portion, the estimated weight is about 345 grams."

The image shows an opened container of 'yogourt nature maigre' (low-fat natural yogurt) that appears to be nearly full. The container is a standard single-serve yogurt pot, which typically contains about 125 grams of yogurt in Swiss retail products. The yogurt looks smooth and fills almost to the top, suggesting it has not been significantly consumed or disturbed. Given the visible size in relation to a typical household object (the cup in the background) and the standard packaging size for this type of yogurt, it is reasonable to estimate the weight around 125 grams."

The target food item is 'carottes' and the image shows two whole, peeled medium-sized carrots on a plate alongside a sandwich. Each carrot looks about 12-14 cm long and of typical diameter. A medium-sized raw carrot typically weighs between 60 to 80 grams. Considering the size and volume of these carrots and that both are whole and uncut, the total weight for the two carrots combined should be between 120 and 160 grams. Given their slightly thick appearance, I estimate the weight of the two carrots together to be about 140 grams."

The piece is about the length of the smaller croissant on the plate and appears to be about 12-14 cm long, roughly 2-3 cm wide and 1.5-2 cm thick. Gruyère is a dense cheese, so even a small piece can weigh noticeably. Considering typical density and size for such a cut of cheese, the weight is likely between 60 and 90 grams. The size looks medium for a cheese portion, leaning towards the average serving size. Therefore, a reasoned estimate of the weight of this bout de gruyère is approximately 75 grams."

The cereal pieces appear to be granola-type clusters with some chocolate pieces, spread thinly across the bottom of a medium-sized bowl. The milk depth covers about half or less of the cereal volume. Given the visual size of the bowl relative to the spoon and pen nearby, this is a modest single serving. Granola cereals are relatively dense compared to puffed cereals. The total volume of cereal visible is approximately a small to medium amount, likely less than half a full bowl portion. A typical full bowl serving of granola cereals is around 40-50 grams, but here the amount looks to be about half that or slightly more. Thus, the plausible range is 20-30 grams. Considering the cereal coverage and depth, I estimate the cereal weight to be about 25 grams."

The slice has a dense, slightly cracked but moist-looking texture typical of a chocolate fondant, which tends to be rich and compact. The thickness of the slice is moderate—roughly 3-4 cm tall at its tallest point—and the length appears to be about 12 cm along the base, with a width at the widest part of approximately 6 cm. Given these dimensions and the dense cake texture, a typical slice of homemade chocolate fondant of this size commonly weighs between 110 to 140 grams. Considering the visual density, thickness, and portion size, it is reasonable to select a mid-range estimate. Therefore, the estimated weight of this fondant au chocolat maison slice is approximately 125 grams."

The ratatouille is visible on the right side of the plate in a generous portion. It consists of cooked vegetables such as zucchini, tomato, pepper, and onion, which tend to be soft and slightly dense when stewed. The portion covers about one third of the plate's surface and has a modest thickness, likely around 1.5 to 2 cm. Considering the density of cooked vegetables in ratatouille, and the volume it occupies on the plate, a typical portion of ratatouille of this size would weigh between 150 and 200 grams. Given the moderate fullness of the portion shown, I estimate the ratatouille portion to be about 180 grams."

Each drumette is roughly 7-8 cm in length, typical of small to medium chicken wing parts. Cooked chicken drumettes commonly weigh between 40 to 60 grams each depending on size and cooking moisture loss. These drumettes appear moderately sized, not particularly large or small. Together, two drumettes would reasonably weigh between 80 and 120 grams. Given their thickness and moderate charring, I estimate this portion closer to the middle of that range at approximately 100 grams. This estimate aligns with their visible volume compared to the other foods on the plate, and with typical Swiss meal portion sizes for meat pieces."

The image shows a metal container with three distinct food portions: grilled eggplant slices on top, a piece of pork with a white creamy sauce, and a serving of polenta topped with shredded cheese. The polenta portion appears as a relatively dense, creamy mound with the shredded cheese piled on top, occupying roughly one third of the container's volume. Given the container size (which seems to be a typical lunchbox container, about 15-20 cm in length), and the visual density of polenta, I estimate the polenta base (without cheese) to weigh between 140 and 180 grams. Adding the shredded cheese, which likely weighs about 20-30 grams, the total polenta with cheese is about 170-210 grams. Since the target is just ""polenta"" and typically the cheese would not be considered part of the polenta weight alone, I estimate the polenta itself to be around 160 grams. The portion is medium-sized, neither small nor very large, and the density of cooked polenta is considerable but not heavy like meat. This estimate aligns well with the relative amounts of pork and eggplant visible, which seem to be in similar weight ranges."

The image shows two long, narrow slices of pain au céréales bread spread with chocolate hazelnut spread on a small square plate. The bread slices are visibly porous and thin, typical of seeded rustic bread, with some areas more hollow. Each slice appears to be about 15-17 cm long and relatively thin, likely cut from a baguette-style loaf or smaller artisanal loaf. Normally, pain au céréales bread slices of this size weigh between 40-60 grams each due to their airy crumb structure, but here, the slices look fairly thin and partially hollowed out. Considering the visible thickness and density, and assuming standard Swiss artisanal bread sizes, each slice likely weighs around 45 grams. Since there are two slices, the total bread portion weighs approximately 90 grams. However, the task is to estimate the weight of one specified food item, and the input specified is 'pain au céréales'. Therefore, I estimate the weight of one slice to be about 45 grams."

The image shows a bowl containing a mixed salad with visible chunks of cooked beetroot (betterave cuite) and pieces of cucumber (concombre). The cucumbers are cut into medium-sized slices with green skin, distributed evenly throughout a moderate portion of this salad. The bowl size appears medium, and the pieces fill a good portion of the bowl. Considering a typical cucumber density and average slice size, each chunk likely weighs around 10-15 grams. There are approximately 7-9 visible cucumber pieces, and accounting for some partially hidden pieces, the total weight of cucumber present is plausibly in the range of 70-120 grams. On balance, given the volume and distribution, a reasonable estimate for the total cucumber weight is about 95 grams."

The pasta portion appears uncooked and is spread in a small pile, roughly covering a central area of the board with moderate thickness. Considering the typical density and weight of fresh pasta, a portion of this size looks to be roughly a small to medium serving. Given the visual volume relative to the tomatoes and garlic, and referencing common Swiss portion sizes, I estimate the pasta weight between 50 and 70 grams, with a final estimate of 60 grams to reflect the moderate portion and compactness of the pile."

The image shows a white bowl containing a portion of plain natural yogurt (yogourt nature) with a creamy and slightly thick texture. The yogurt is not filling the bowl, but it forms a modest mound. Considering the depth of the bowl and the volume of the yogurt visible, this appears to be about a small to medium serving size. A standard serving of natural yogurt in Switzerland often ranges between 100 to 150 grams. Given the visual volume is moderate but not full, I estimate the weight here to be around 120 grams. This fits a reasonable portion size without overestimating or underestimating based on the visible density and container size."

Given the volume and the usual density of cooked white rice, a portion filling half a medium bowl typically weighs between 120 and 160 grams. Considering the fullness and the spoon size for scale, the rice portion looks moderate but not overfilled. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the rice portion to be approximately 140 grams."

Each piece of chicken on a skewer typically weighs around 20-30 grams depending on size. Here, there are about 4-5 small chunks on the skewer. Considering the pieces are reasonably sized but not very thick, I estimate each chunk averages about 22 grams. Multiplying by 4 visible pieces gives a rough range of 85-95 grams. Taking into account some uncertainty in piece size and density, the realistic weight range would be 80-100 grams. I choose a final estimate of 90 grams for the '2eme poulet' skewer portion on the plate."

The cheese layer is melted but not overly thick, lightly coating the surface. The volume seems like a typical home-cooked single portion, neither too small nor large. Given that cooked pasta is relatively dense but less heavy than it appears due to air pockets, combined with the density of tuna and cooked cheese, the overall mass can be estimated by considering the volume and composition. The portion roughly occupies a compact mound about 10 cm in diameter and 3-4 cm thick on the plate. Based on these factors, and accounting for the presence of vegetables and protein mixed with pasta, a reasonable weight range would be 180-220 grams. Selecting a mid-value within this range to reflect a moderate serving size, I estimate the portion weight at approximately 200 grams."

The image shows two pieces of bread ('pain') placed on a plate, which looks like a modest-sized slice cut in half. The bread appears to be a dense, brown type likely similar to whole wheat or multigrain common in Switzerland. Each half is roughly a quarter of a regular round or oval bread loaf slice. A typical slice of such bread weighs about 50-60 grams whole, so half a slice would weigh around 25-30 grams. Since the visible portion is about one slice split into two parts, the total bread weight should be close to 50-60 grams. The thickness and density visible support this. The chocolate spread does not affect the bread weight. Therefore, given the slice size, density, and visual volume, I estimate the weight of the 'pain' to be approximately 55 grams, within a plausible range of 50 to 60 grams."

Vegetarian gyozas tend to be light compared to meat ones due to the less dense filling. Typically, each gyoza weighs between 30 and 40 grams depending on size and stuffing density. These three pieces look moderately filled, not overly plump but cooked and expanded somewhat. Based on the visible size compared to the plate and usual gyoza dimensions, I estimate a weight range of 30-40 g per piece. Multiplying by 3, the total is approximately 90-120 grams. Choosing a midpoint for a moderate portion size, I estimate the total weight of the 3 vegetarian gyozas to be about 105 grams."

The tuna is in small to medium flakes and pieces mixed evenly throughout the salad. The container appears to be a medium-sized meal prep container, about 15 cm wide and roughly 6-7 cm deep. Considering the volume occupied by the tuna relative to the couscous and cucumber pieces, the tuna likely accounts for about one fifth to one quarter of the total mixture by weight. Tuna is dense, so even these flakes contribute significantly to the weight. Given that cooked couscous weighs about 120-130 g per cup and the container seems to hold about 2 cups of the salad mixture total (roughly 250-270 g total), the tuna portion could be estimated reasonably around 50-70 grams. The visible pieces suggest a medium portion, not scant or very abundant, so a final estimate near the midpoint of this range, about 60 grams, is most plausible."

Considering the thickness of the slices and typical density and water content of raw tomatoes, the total weight is likely close to the weight of a medium-sized whole tomato. By comparing with the cooked wheat (blé) and gratin of swiss chard (côte de bette), which take the remaining parts of the container, and using the container size estimated roughly as a small meal prep box (about 500-600 ml volume), the tomato portion appears moderate but not oversized.

The target food, 'boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate', can be seen as small round vegetable balls covered in red tomato sauce and scattered mostly on top of a bed of penne pasta. There are about nine completely visible boulettes plus a partial one behind the gruyère cheese topping. Each boulettes au légumes appears fairly small, roughly the size of a large walnut or about 3-4 cm in diameter. Vegetable balls typically weigh less than meatballs due to vegetable density but they still have some meat alternative density and moisture. I estimate each boulettes au légumes weighs between 25-35 grams based on size and density. With nine full ones, the plausible weight range would be 225-315 grams in total. Considering the portion looks quite generous but not huge, I choose a value toward the middle upper range, about 280 grams.

The bowl shows sliced kiwi fruit pieces covering roughly half of the bowl's surface around the séré maigre (a type of low-fat fresh cheese). Each kiwi slice is roughly 2-3 cm long and relatively thick, indicating the kiwi is fresh and cut from a medium-sized fruit. Considering the volume spread and the typical density of fresh kiwi (high water content but solid texture), the total amount of kiwi corresponds to about one medium kiwi fruit. A medium kiwi generally weighs between 70 and 90 grams when peeled and cut. Since this appears to be nearly one full kiwi's worth of pieces, a reasonable estimated range would be 70-90 grams. I select a middle value towards the upper side for fullness and chunk size, so approximately 85 grams."

The target food item is 'agneau', visible on the plate as a single grilled sausage-like piece on the left side. Compared to the other foods on the plate, such as the chicken pieces and the Lebanese flatbread, the portion of lamb is relatively small. The agneau piece is about the size of a small sausage or meat kebab segment, roughly 7-8 cm long and about 2-3 cm in diameter. Given the density of cooked lamb meat and its size, it likely weighs more than a small meatball or chunk of chicken but less than a full large sausage. Usually, a small piece like this would weigh between 40 and 60 grams. Considering its visual thickness and length, I estimate around 50 grams for this portion of lamb. This estimate fits well with the relative size of other components on the plate and typical Swiss portion sizes."

The image shows three small round bread rolls on a white surface. Two of them are lighter in color and appear to be brioches with chocolate pieces ('brioche au chocolat'), while the third one is darker and looks like 'pain aux noix'. The brioche au chocolat are roughly the size of small rolls, about 7-8 cm in diameter, with visible chocolate chips embedded in the dough. Such individual brioches typically weigh between 70 and 90 grams depending on density. Given the size and the visible density of the dough and chocolate distribution, each brioche au chocolat here likely weighs around 80 grams. The range I considered was approximately 70-90 grams considering average small pastry sizes in Switzerland. Hence, my estimate accounts for the visible size, density, and ingredient content."

The image shows a rectangular waffle (gaufre) with some apple compote spread on top. The waffle looks like a homemade or small commercial type, roughly 10x7 cm in area, and about 1.5-2 cm thick. Such a waffle typically weighs around 70-90 grams based on its size and cooking style. The apple compote covers about half to two-thirds of the waffle surface, but since the question is about the waffle itself and not the compote, its presence only gives a reference for size and does not affect the waffle weight. Considering the waffle is not thick but appears solid and cooked evenly, the portion corresponds to roughly 80 grams. The plate’s design and relative portion size align with this estimation, and this weight is plausible as a single serving waffle size in Switzerland."

The image shows a plate with several green asparagus stalks laid on top of couscous, cauliflower florets, and chicken. There are about 8 visible asparagus stalks, ranging in thickness and length, with most being roughly medium thickness and about 10-12 cm long. Asparagus stalks typically weigh around 10-15 grams each for this size. Given that some may be trimmed and taking into account that they are whole stalks, the total weight of the asparagus can be estimated by multiplying roughly 12 grams by 8. This gives an estimated range of about 80 to 100 grams. Considering the visible portion occupies a significant part of the plate but is not piled very thickly, I estimate the weight of the asparagus to be approximately 90 grams."

The image shows a bowl with a substantial amount of muesli nature, which consists of oats, grains, and seeds, dry and dense in texture. The muesli covers most of the bowl's surface and seems to be a thick layer, approximately 2-3 cm deep considering the bowl size and the visible quantity. Given that typical dry muesli weighs between 40-50 grams per 30 ml volume and considering the bowl size (medium cereal bowl about 12 cm diameter) and the visible volume, the muesli portion can be reasonably estimated between 70-100 grams. I will choose a midpoint estimate reflecting a medium portion that visually appears neither too small nor overflowing. Therefore, the estimated weight for the muesli nature portion is 85 grams."

The image shows a small glass with houmous au basilic (basil hummus) which appears to be about half full. The cup is approximately the size of a standard small glass, holding roughly 100-120 ml when full. Given the density of hummus, which is thick but spreadable, 100 ml corresponds approximately to 130 grams. Since the glass is about half full, the portion of houmous au basilic is likely around 60-70 grams. Considering modest depth and amount, a realistic estimate is 65 grams for this serving. This aligns well with typical small hummus portion sizes served as a dip on a plate."

The food item to estimate is 'pomme de terre duchesse,' which are the five small golden swirled potato portions on the right side of the plate. Each petite duchess potato portion is about the size of a large walnut or a small egg yolk dollop. Duchess potatoes are dense, creamy, and rich, and typical individual weights for such small portions range between 20 to 30 grams. Given there are five pieces, and each looks moderately sized and fully cooked (not shriveled or partially eaten), I estimate each one to weigh around 22 to 28 grams. This gives a total range of approximately 110 to 140 grams for all five pieces combined. Taking a mid-range value with slight caution against underestimation, I select 128 grams as a reasonable estimate for the total weight of the 'pomme de terre duchesse' on this plate."

The image shows a white bowl with a mixture of rice and dahl de lentille (lentil stew). The lentils appear cooked with visible pieces of vegetables such as carrots and onions. The mixture fills roughly half to two-thirds of the bowl's volume. Given the bowl size is standard medium (about 15 cm diameter), and the dahl appears dense and thick, the weight would be considerable. Rice is mixed in but the target is the dahl de lentille portion only. The lentils and vegetables look well incorporated but do not fully fill the bowl independently; they share space with rice. Visually, the dahl likely occupies about half the visible volume in the bowl which would be approximately 200-300 grams. Given that dahl is dense and legume dishes tend to be underestimated, a final estimate in the middle of this range is appropriate. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the dahl de lentille to be around 250 grams."

The cervelas is visible on the right side of the plate, mixed into a chili-like sauce with beans. The pieces of cervelas are cut into chunks about 2-3 cm in size. The total portion of this chili mixture occupies about half the plate. Considering the visible chunk sizes and density of cooked cervelas sausage, individual pieces likely weigh around 15-20 grams each. Visually, there are roughly 8-10 chunks visible, suggesting a total cervelas weight between 130 and 180 grams. Given the visible volume and density of the sausage chunks integrated with the chili, I estimate the cervelas portion to be approximately 160 grams."

The target food item is 'sauce salade', which appears as a white creamy sauce poured over the cucumber slices near the bottom center of the plate. The sauce covers part of the cucumber slices but does not seem to be a very thick layer. Given the typical serving style of salad dressing in Switzerland and considering the visible pool of sauce, it appears to be approximately 2-3 tablespoons in volume. A tablespoon of salad dressing typically weighs about 15 grams. Thus, the weight range would be roughly 30 to 45 grams. I estimate the portion to be medium-sized, so a reasonable final estimate is about 35 grams. This amount is consistent with the amount of visible sauce compared to other items on the plate and typical dressing portioning."

The image shows a small bowl containing bircher maison (a type of oat-based dish) and a portion of fruits rouges décongelés (thawed red fruits). The fruits rouges are on the left side of the bowl and appear as a dense, somewhat crushed portion with visible juice. The bowl is relatively small, likely around 10-12 cm in diameter. The fruits rouges cover roughly half of the area on the top, with a modest depth. Given that frozen and thawed berries tend to lose some volume and contain juice, they are less dense than fresh fruit but still packed. Estimating the volume of the fruits rouges portion as approximately 100 ml and considering an average berry density around 0.9 g/ml including juice, the weight of the fruits rouges is about 90 grams. Given slight uncertainty in compaction and juice, I consider a reasonable range of 75 to 100 grams, and choose a final estimate of 90 grams."

The image shows two breaded chicken fillets inside a glass container, placed on top of some basmati rice and sliced cooked carrots. The fillets have a typical breaded texture with some browning marks from frying. Given their size relative to the container (which appears to be roughly 12 cm square) and the approximate thickness (around 1.5 cm), these fillets look like small to medium-sized portions, common in Swiss packed lunches. A typical breaded chicken fillet of this size usually weighs between 100-150 grams. Since there are two fillets and the smaller one is about half the length of the larger, I estimate the larger fillet to weigh around 110 grams and the smaller one around 55 grams, totaling approximately 165 grams. Considering minor weight variations and the breading added, this range is about 150-180 grams, settling on 165 grams as a reasonable final estimate."

The image shows a white plate with three distinct food portions: mozzarella, green salad ('salade verte'), and green olives. The target food is mozzarella. The mozzarella appears to be a whole small ball or a half portion of a larger ball on the plate. Based on the smooth surface and size compared to the olives (which are about 3-4 cm each), the mozzarella ball is roughly the size of a typical 100g mozzarella ball often sold in Swiss markets. The thickness and height confirm it is not a large portion like 125g or 150g, nor is it a tiny piece. A reasonable weight range would be 90-110 grams. Choosing the middle, giving appropriate allowance for moisture and density, the estimated weight is about 100 grams."

The image shows a plate with three main food items: tomatoes cerises, salade iceberg, and raviolis à la courge. The raviolis are positioned on the top left portion of the plate, with about 5 visible raviolis. Each ravioli is moderately sized, typical of filled pasta, about 4-5 cm in width. Given the thin pasta dough and filling with squash (courge), the density is moderate—less than dense meat filling but more than just pasta. A typical ravioli weighs approximately 20-25 grams. With 5 visible raviolis, this suggests a range between 100 and 125 grams. Considering the arrangement and some overlap indicates a tight portion without excess, I estimate the total weight of the raviolis à la courge on the plate to be around 115 grams. This estimate aligns well with the visible size and the portion relative to the other food items on the plate."

The salade verte is located on the left side of the plate, under the tomato slices and sprinkled with a mixed seed blend. The leafy greens appear to be a small to medium portion covering roughly one third of the plate's surface. The leaves appear fresh but loosely packed, so they have a low density. Considering typical Swiss salad serving sizes and the plate diameter relative to the fork and knife, the salad portion looks like about 40 to 60 grams of leaf greens. Taking into account the visual volume and the seed topping which does not add much weight to the salad greens themselves, I estimate the salade verte weight to be about 50 grams."

The image shows a single whole cooked artichaut (artichoke) placed on a large plate. The artichoke is of a typical medium-small size, considering the hand holding the plate for scale. Artichokes generally range from about 100 grams for small size up to around 300 grams for larger ones. This one looks relatively compact and not very large, more of a smaller to medium size. Given the visible volume and thickness of the leaves, and assuming it's cooked (which generally reduces weight slightly but not drastically), a plausible weight range would be 150-200 grams. Considering this portion looks average rather than particularly small or large, a final estimate leaning towards the middle of that range is appropriate. Therefore, I estimate the artichaut weighs around 170 grams."

The salade de pomme de terre (potato salad) is located at the bottom left of the plate. It appears creamy, with thick slices of potato coated in a white sauce, likely mayonnaise-based. There are about 6-7 slices visible, each roughly 3-4 cm in diameter and about 0.5 cm thick. Potato salad is dense and moist. Given the visible volume and typical density, this portion looks medium-sized but not very large. Compared to the other foods on the plate, it occupies a similar area to the carrot salad but appears denser. A typical medium portion of potato salad on a Swiss plate is around 120-150 grams. This seems consistent here. Considering the slice size, coverage, and sauce volume, I estimate the potato salad weighs approximately 135 grams."

The target food item, 'caviar d'aubergine,' is visually identified as the spread on the slice of seed bread located in the middle right of the plate. The slice of bread is medium-sized, and the aubergine spread appears to be applied moderately thickly over most of the bread's surface. Given the density of typical eggplant spread, which is fairly moist and dense, and considering the typical weight of bread slices (around 40-50 grams for this size), the amount of caviar d'aubergine spread likely weighs approximately 30-40 grams. This accounts for a thin to medium layer of spread on the bread. A thinner spread of only 20 grams would be too light given the visual coverage, whereas 50 grams would seem excessive for this bread slice. Therefore, a reasonable precise estimate is about 35 grams."

Each piece of chicken looks like a small, thick chunk, likely from a skewer or cut piece of breast or thigh meat. Given their size relative to the plate, each piece appears to weigh about 40 to 50 grams. Together, the two pieces therefore likely weigh between 80 and 100 grams. Considering some moisture loss from cooking and the visible density, I estimate the total weight of the chicken pieces to be around 90 grams. This estimate fits well with the relative size of the pepper slices and the plate without overestimating the portion size."

The pepper pieces are lightly cooked or roasted, as indicated by the slight browning on their edges. A whole medium yellow pepper in Switzerland generally weighs around 150-180 grams fresh. Cooking reduces the weight slightly due to water loss, but the pepper looks mostly intact. The stuffed half likely weighs around 75 grams, and the two smaller slices together about 40-50 grams. Considering the visual volume, density, and cooking state, the total weight of the yellow pepper pieces present should be around 120-130 grams.

Given the size relative to the fingers, it looks like a small but dense slice, roughly 6 cm by 5 cm and about 2 cm thick. Fruit bread tends to be dense due to dried fruits and nuts, meaning it weighs more than regular bread of the same size. A typical small slice of dense fruit bread weighing about this volume generally ranges between 50 and 80 grams.

The target food item is the 'sandwich jambon,' which is clearly visible on a small plate alongside a canapé au saumon. The sandwich is made with a multigrain baguette, approximately 15-18 cm long. The sandwich is filled with slices of ham and a small amount of lettuce and possibly a spread. Given the visible thickness and typical density of a ham sandwich of this size, and comparing it to the canapé, the sandwich appears to be a medium-sized portion. A standard small baguette sandwich with ham in Switzerland usually weighs between 120 to 160 grams. Considering the moderate filling visible and the bread volume, the sandwich jambon is best estimated around 140 grams. The range for plausibility is about 130-150 grams given the visible size and filling quantity."

The image shows a plate with several food items, including sliced red bell peppers (poivron), grilled chicken pieces, sliced tomato, lettuce, avocado slices, and two wheat or grain wraps. The poivron portion consists of thinly sliced strips, spread out on the plate. Considering the relative size compared to the chicken chunks and avocado slices, the volume of the bell pepper appears to be a moderate serving. Bell peppers are mostly water and light in density, so while the volume seems significant, the weight will be lower than denser foods. A typical thinly sliced medium red bell pepper might weigh about 150-200 grams whole. The shown portion is roughly about one third to half of a medium bell pepper. Therefore, conservatively estimating, the poivron portion here likely weighs between 50 to 80 grams. Given the visual fullness and spread, I estimate the weight of the poivron to be approximately 65 grams."

The wheat pearls have a typical density and volume, and the portion looks moderate, covering about half of the bowl's bottom. Considering the bowl size and typical volume of cooked wheat pearls with sauce, the portion appears to be medium-sized, neither very small nor overflowing. Wheat pearls cooked in sauce tend to weigh around 130-180 grams in this portion size. Given the visual evidence and generous appearance within the bowl, I estimate the perle de blé weighs approximately 160 grams."

The sauce oignons (onion sauce) is visually identified as the brownish, slightly translucent sauce with cooked onion slices visible on top of the slices of roast meat. It spreads slightly around the roast meat on the plate. The portion is not very large but covers a decent surface area and depth beneath the onion slices. Considering a normal serving of sauce with roast in a Swiss context, the sauce portion likely weighs between 40 and 60 grams. Given the visible volume and typical density of cooked onion sauce, and the fact that it is spread mostly around the meat and partly on the plate, the estimated weight is about 50 grams. This is consistent with the size of the roast slices and other side dishes. The sauce looks like a medium portion, not just a thin drizzle."

Given typical Swiss portion sizes and the shredded vegetable's density, the weight likely falls between 50 and 80 grams. Taking the moderate volume and density into account, I estimate the salade de céleri to weigh about 65 grams."

The image shows a white bowl filled with sliced strawberries sprinkled with sugar. The bowl is a small to medium-sized one, and the strawberries appear to be cut into medium-sized pieces, roughly 15-18 pieces visible. Each sliced strawberry piece weighs approximately 10-12 grams considering the density and size. The sugar does not add much weight and can be ignored for the fruit weight estimation. The portion fills most of the bowl but without overflowing, suggesting a moderate serving size. Given these observations, the total weight of the strawberries is likely in the range of 160-210 grams. I estimate the weight of the strawberries to be approximately 185 grams."

The image shows two slices of toasted bread on a plate. One slice is spread with butter and honey-like mélasse, and the other slice, which is the target food (confiture abricot), has a layer of apricot jam spread evenly over the top. The slice size is typical for standard sandwich or breakfast bread, roughly 10-12 cm wide and 7-9 cm high. The jam layer covers the surface thinly but visibly. Apricot jam is dense and sticky, but the thin spread does not add significant weight. Considering standard jar jam density and typical spread thickness on a slice, an even layer on one slice of this size generally weighs around 15 to 25g. The portion here seems medium thickness, so the estimation is near the middle of that range. Therefore, the estimated weight for the apricot jam (confiture abricot) on the slice is approximately 20 grams."

The lard is visible on the upper right of the plate, consisting of three pieces with a slightly crispy and fatty appearance. The pieces are relatively thin but have some volume due to the fatty texture. Compared to the other items on the plate (like the chicken skewers, avocado slice, and carrot pile), the lard pieces cover a smaller area but are denser and heavier per surface unit. Each piece likely weighs around 15 grams considering thickness and density. The total estimated weight of the three pieces together is around 40 to 50 grams. Given the visible portion and density, I estimate the weight of the lard to be approximately 45 grams."

The image shows a white plate with a small piece of cooked salmon and three cooked shrimp. The salmon piece is relatively small, roughly the size of a bite or two, appearing to be part of a larger fillet but now reduced to a small portion. Based on visual size comparison with the fork and the shrimp, the salmon portion is approximately 4-5 cm in length and about 2-3 cm in width and thickness. Given the density of cooked salmon, a piece of this size would typically weigh around 25 to 40 grams. Considering it's a small piece but with visible thickness, a reasonable estimate lies around 30 grams. The shrimp nearby help contextualize portion size; they are medium-sized shrimp, about 20 grams each, but only the salmon portion is estimated here as requested. Thus, the estimated weight of the salmon piece shown is about 30 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread ('pain'), each covered with a spread—one with butter and jam, the other with Nutella. The bread slices are typical medium-sized slices of rustic or country-style bread common in Switzerland, with a rough crust and an airy crumb. Each slice appears roughly 10 cm long and 7-8 cm wide with moderate thickness (about 1.5-2 cm). A typical slice of such bread weighs approximately 40-50 grams. Since the slices look average in size and density, I estimate each slice to be about 45 grams. Given the request is for 'pain' and two slices are visible, but only one slice is specifically asked to be estimated, I assume the task is to estimate the weight of one slice. Therefore, I estimate the weight of one slice of bread to be around 45 grams."

Considering the size of the bread (typical slice of about 25g weight) and the yogurt spread's thickness and surface area coverage, it is likely about 15-25 grams of yogurt. The portion is not very thick but fully covers the bread slice, so I lean towards the upper middle of this range. A plausible range would be 15 to 25 grams, and I estimate approximately 20 grams of yogurt here."

The target food is 'fromage pâte dure,' which is the hard cheese piece on the plate. Visually, this piece is small and looks like a wedge about 5 cm long and roughly 2 cm wide and thick. Hard cheeses are dense and compact, so even a small piece can weigh a noticeable amount. Comparing its size with the half apple next to it, the cheese is about 1/6 to 1/7 of the apple's volume. Considering a medium apple half weighs around 100–125 grams, this cheese piece likely weighs around 30 to 40 grams. The edges look crumbly but not very thin, confirming a compact density typical of hard cheese. Therefore, estimating conservatively while accounting for density and volume, the piece weighs about 35 grams, within a plausible range of 30 to 40 grams."

The image shows a slice of a strawberry tart ('tarte aux fraises') on a small dessert plate. The slice has visible fresh strawberries on top, along with a creamy filling and a thin crust base. There are about seven medium-sized strawberry halves visible, and some red currants embedded in the cream. The strawberries are relatively dense but not very heavy individually; a medium strawberry half weighs about 10-12 grams, thus the seven halves weigh roughly 70-85 grams in total. The creamy filling below appears substantial and covers the entire crust slice, which itself is quite thin but extends around the base. The crust and cream can be estimated at around 60-80 grams combined for this piece, given its thickness and volume compared to the strawberries. Adding these components together, the portion looks like a medium-sized slice typically weighing between 130 and 165 grams. Considering the visible size relative to the plate and the density of ingredients, the final estimate is approximately 150 grams."

The image shows a single slice of rhubarb cake on a plate. The slice appears to be of medium size, typical of a serving cut from an 8- or 9-inch round cake. The cake's thickness seems moderate, with a thin crust and a topping of chopped rhubarb pieces spread over the surface. Rhubarb is fairly dense but has a high moisture content which reduces weight somewhat. The visible rhubarb pieces cover the entire slice fairly evenly but are not piled thickly. Considering typical home-baked rhubarb cakes, a full cake usually weighs around 900 to 1100 grams. Given this slice is about one eighth of the cake, the weight should be roughly in the 110-140 grams range. Taking into account the visible texture and thickness, a reasonable estimate would be about 130 grams. This matches well with its appearance and is consistent with standard portion sizes for such cakes in Switzerland."

There are about 7 to 8 strips of cheese, each strip appearing thin and roughly the size of a finger in length and a few centimeters wide. Considering a typical slice of Swiss semi-hard cheese like Emmental or Gruyère, a thin finger-sized slice typically weighs around 8-12 grams. Given the number of strips and their thinness, the total cheese on this sandwich looks like a small to medium portion. I estimate the total cheese weight to be between 45g and 60g. Choosing the middle-ground for a modest but not minimal portion, the estimated weight is about 52 grams. This fits well with the visible portion and is reasonable relative to the bread size and the other ingredients."

The image shows a glass jar with a creamy mixture of yogurt, oats, chia seeds, honey, and almond purée. The chia seeds are visible throughout the mixture but they are small seeds dispersed evenly within the volume. Since the seeds are mixed into a thick, creamy base and do not appear as a separate pile, their weight is a fraction of the volume in the jar. The jar looks to be about 250-300 ml in volume and roughly 3-5% of the mixture seems to be chia seeds by volume, in line with typical overnight oats recipes. Chia seeds are dense, so their mass is somewhat larger than their volume implies. Based on visual assessment and recipe context, the chia seeds likely weigh between 15 and 25 grams. I estimate the chia seeds in this portion to be approximately 20 grams, accounting for the distribution and typical quantities used in such preparations."

The image shows a metal container divided mostly with seven types of food. The 'tomate' portion is on the left side, consisting of two visible slices of fresh tomato cut from a medium tomato. Each slice seems about 1 cm thick and occupies a moderate surface area that fits within a lunch box compartment. Typically, one medium tomato weighs about 120-150 grams, and two slices like these would roughly correspond to around 1/3 to 1/2 of a whole tomato. Therefore, the weight is estimated not by counting whole fruits but by typical slice size and density. The volume and density of raw tomato are moderate due to their water content. Taking into account the thickness, surface, and density, a reasonable weight range for the two slices is 50 to 70 grams. I select the midpoint with a slight bias towards medium size because the slices are not very thick but substantial. Thus, I estimate the 'tomate' portion weight to be approximately 60 grams."

The image shows two slices of pizza aux épinards on a standard-sized dinner plate, which helps scale the size. Each slice looks like a typical medium pizza slice with a thin to medium crust, covered by cheese and spinach pieces. Spinach, when cooked and placed on pizza, weighs less in volume than it appears due to moisture and leaf density. The cheese coverage is moderate and consistent. A typical medium slice of veggie pizza in Switzerland weighs about 120-140 grams. Since these slices have a moderate amount of spinach and cheese, I estimate each slice to be slightly above medium size, closer to 130-140 grams. Considering slight variations in thickness and topping spread, I set a range of 125-145 grams per slice. Selecting a balanced estimate within this range, the weight of one pizza aux épinards slice is approximately 135 grams."

The fromage de chèvre frais à la figue is located near the bottom right of the plate. It is a small white piece of soft goat cheese with bits of fig, appearing creamy and slightly crumbled. Given its size compared with the baguette slice and other cheese pieces on the plate, it looks like a small wedge approximately 3-4 cm long and 1.5-2 cm thick. Fresh goat cheese is dense but soft, and this piece appears relatively small, roughly equivalent to a small snack portion. Considering the density and size, the plausible weight range would be around 20 to 35 grams. Given the volume and visual comparison to other cheeses on the plate and the slice of bread, a good estimate is about 28 grams. This accounts for some density and the visible fig pieces embedded in it."

The white sauce is clearly visible as a relatively thick layer covering the piece of pork. Considering the size of the pork portion, which appears to be roughly the size of a small palm (about 10 cm by 7 cm) and relatively thick, the sauce layer looks like it covers most of the meat with a moderate thickness. Typically, a creamy mustard sauce portion on such a meat piece would weigh between 30 and 50 grams. Given the amount visible, the texture, and the spread of the sauce, a medium portion estimate of about 40 grams is reasonable. The sauce is neither a thin drizzle nor a large pool, so this weight fits the visual volume and common portion sizes of such a sauce in Switzerland. This estimation also aligns well proportionally with the polenta and pork portions visible."

Based on typical densities and the visible size, each slice likely weighs between 10-15 grams. Considering there are four slices with slight variation, the total estimated weight for all the cheese slices combined would be approximately 45-55 grams.

Considering typical dry muesli density (around 0.3 to 0.4 g/ml) and the visual amount filling about half of this small dish, an estimated weight range would be about 60-90 grams. The portion looks like a single serving but not heaping or piled very high, so a medium portion weight towards the middle of this range is reasonable. Comparing with the nearby apple (which can weigh around 150 grams), the muesli amount does not exceed the apple's volume and looks smaller overall. Therefore, I estimate the muesli nature weight to be around 75 grams."

The seeds are small and densely packed in clusters across much of the visible salad surface. Given the size of the plate (a standard dinner plate) and the coverage of the seeds, the total amount appears to be a few tablespoons spread evenly. A tablespoon of flax seeds typically weighs about 10 grams. The visible quantity looks like approximately 2 to 3 tablespoons, but since seeds are loosely piled and a bit unevenly distributed, it is safer to estimate a minimum of 18 grams and a maximum near 25 grams.

Vinegar and mustard seed dressings are liquid and light, and typically density is close to water (1 g/ml). From visual observation, the amount of vinaigre used is about 1 to 2 teaspoons, roughly 5 to 10 ml by volume. Given this, the estimated weight of the vinaigre is minimal.

The asparagus ('asperges') are clearly visible on the left side of a glass container next to portions of rice and chicken with curry sauce. There are three medium-sized asparagus spears, each approximately 12-15 cm long. Asparagus stalks are quite slender and low in density. A typical medium-sized asparagus spear weighs roughly 20-25 grams. Given their length and slight thickness, and considering three spears, the total weight is likely between 60 and 75 grams. Since these appear fresh and uncut, and the portion is moderate, my estimate centers around 70 grams."

The image shows a single small feuilleté (puff pastry) with tomato sauce. The feuilleté is about the size of a small appetizer or snack portion, likely measuring around 4-5 cm in its largest dimension. Given the light, flaky nature of puff pastry and the added moisture and slight weight from the tomato sauce inside, a small piece like this typically weighs between 25 and 40 grams. Considering the visible browning and slight charring, it seems fully baked but not large or dense. Furthermore, comparing the size to the visible grain and texture of the wooden surface, the estimate leans towards the lower to mid-range of that scale. Therefore, the weight of this feuilleté sauce tomate is approximately 32 grams."

The image shows a small bowl containing six black olives, some pitted, and six grape-sized cherry tomatoes. The black olives are medium-sized, typical of table olives, with average weight about 4-5 grams each. Since there are six olives, their combined weight is roughly between 24 to 30 grams. Considering the slight variation in size and the fact that two have visible pits removed, I estimate the weight of the olives to be about 27 grams."

The muesli nature is served in a small orange bowl next to a white bowl containing yaourt nature. The muesli consists of relatively large clusters of oats and other grain components, with a volume indicating a moderately full small bowl. Given the size of the bowl and the visual density of the clusters, the muesli portion looks like a medium serving size. Considering typical density for muesli granola clusters and the bowl size, the weight likely lies between 60 and 90 grams. Given it is quite filled but not heaped, a good estimate is around 75 grams. This is consistent with the portion size relative to the yogurt and common Swiss breakfast servings."

The image depicts a plate of spaghetti topped with Bolognese sauce and a small amount of grated cheese. Focusing only on the spaghetti itself, the pasta portion appears moderately sized, spread on the plate in a loose mound roughly 15 cm across. Considering the density and typical cooked spaghetti weight, this looks like a medium portion. A standard medium portion of cooked spaghetti in Switzerland is typically around 120-150 grams. Given the visual volume on the plate, the spaghetti is neither a small side portion nor an oversized large serving. Therefore, an estimated weight range would be 130-150 grams. Choosing a balanced value in this range, I estimate the spaghetti weight at around 140 grams."

The image shows a small portion of pain provencales, a piece of rustic bread with visible seeds and a typical crust. The piece is about half a slice of bread and has a moderate thickness. Considering the visible texture, size relative to the plate, and typical density of such bread, a full slice generally weighs around 40-50 grams. Since this portion is about half a slice, the estimated weight should be roughly half of that, so between 20 to 25 grams. Taking a middle ground, I estimate the pain provencales to be about 23 grams."

The image shows a single lemon slice floating in a clear glass of water. The lemon slice is thin, about 3-4 mm thick, and has a diameter similar to the width of a standard drinking glass, roughly 6-7 cm. Lemon slices are mostly water and have low density, but the rind adds some mass. A typical lemon slice of this size usually weighs around 5 to 8 grams. Considering the thickness and the visual fullness of the slice in the glass, the estimated weight falls roughly in that range. Therefore, I estimate the lemon slice ('rondelle de citron') weighs approximately 6 grams."

The image shows a plate of cooked pasta topped with two fried eggs and drizzled with ketchup. The fried eggs are clearly visible and appear to be made from two whole eggs, judging by the size, shape, and amount of cooked egg white and yolk present. Each cooked egg typically weighs about 50 grams, considering some water loss during cooking. Combined, the two eggs likely weigh between 90 and 110 grams because the edges are thin and a bit spread out but the yolks remain mostly intact and present. Given this visual evidence, a reasonable estimate for the total weight of the eggs on the plate is around 100 grams."

The image shows a small blue bowl held in a person's hand above a knee, containing a light beige creamy pudding identified as crème caramel. From the size of the hand and knee, the bowl appears small, likely a dessert-sized portion. The crème caramel covers the bottom of the bowl in a shallow layer with some texture lumps visible, probably from caramel or custard solidification. Typical portions of crème caramel in such small bowls range from about 100 to 150 grams. Given the relatively thin, but full coverage in the small bowl, the volume looks closer to the lower-medium range of usual dessert portions. Considering the density of crème caramel is similar to custard (close to that of water but slightly denser), the weight is roughly equivalent to the volume in milliliters. I estimate a range of 110 to 140 grams as plausible, and selecting a medium value within that range leads to about 125 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing a mixture primarily of blanc battu (a type of buttermilk or yogurt-like dairy product), oat flakes, chia seeds, and honey. The seeds are dispersed throughout the mixture, but since the target food here is specifically ""graines de chia"" (chia seeds), I must isolate their quantity. Visually, the chia seeds are the small black dots evenly distributed within a volume roughly half the size of a medium-sized bowl (approximately 1 cup volume). Chia seeds are very light and tiny, but dense in mass compared to their volume. Estimating visually, the chia seeds appear to represent about 10-15% of the total mixture by volume. Given that a tablespoon of chia seeds weighs roughly 12 grams, and judging from their spread and quantity, I estimate there are about 1.5 tablespoons total of chia seeds present. This would correspond to about 18 grams. Considering some margin of error for small clusters and the visible distribution, a plausible range is 15-20 grams. Therefore, my final estimate for the weight of the chia seeds in this bowl is 18 grams."

The image shows a portion of bulgur in a glass container along with ratatouille and two halves of a hard-boiled egg. The bulgur is cooked and appears to fill about one third of the container's base, with a height of roughly 2-3 cm. Considering typical cooked bulgur density and portions, a medium serving in this container size would weigh between 120 and 180 grams. Given the bulgur looks moderately packed but not overly dense, I estimate it closer to the middle-upper part of this range. Therefore, the bulgur portion is approximately 160 grams."

The yogurt orange sanguine is mixed with a cereal and blueberry mixture in a medium-sized bowl. The yogurt is not separately visible because it is blended with the other ingredients, but the creamy texture indicates it is the main component. Considering a typical serving of flavored yogurt used in such a bowl, and judging by the volume in the bowl, the yogurt portion looks substantial, likely around 150-200 grams. The bowl is not filled to the brim but is well-covered with the yogurt mixture, implying a decent quantity. Given this, a weight estimate of 180 grams seems plausible, falling within a reasonable range of 150 to 200 grams."

The pumpkin seeds are scattered sparsely throughout the dish, with each seed being about 1-2 grams in weight. Visually, there appear to be around 15-20 seeds distributed in the portion visible here. Pumpkin seeds are dense but small, so estimating an average of 1.5 grams per seed and accounting for possible seeds hidden from direct view, a reasonable total weight estimate for the pumpkin seeds is between 20 and 30 grams. Given the portion size relative to the whole salad container, I estimate the total weight of graines de courge here as approximately 25 grams."

Focusing on the butter ('beurre'), it is spread thinly but covering most of both slices. Typical butter spread on bread ranges between 5-10 grams per slice for a moderate layer. Given that both slices have butter underneath the mélasse or jam and considering the size of a standard slice of rustic bread, the total visible butter portion likely weighs around 10-15 grams combined. Since the butter is spread quite evenly with some spots thinner due to topping, I estimate the total butter weight at around 12 grams."

The image shows a white plate containing several pieces of white asparagus along with a serving of mayonnaise Thomy. The mayonnaise is in a soft, creamy dollop shape located at the top left of the plate. Mayonnaise is dense and creamy but typically served in small amounts as a condiment. This dollop appears to be around the size of a large tablespoon, approximately 15 ml in volume. Considering the density of mayonnaise (about 0.9 grams per ml), this corresponds to roughly 13-15 grams. Given slight compression and the visible size, a reasonable portion estimate is around 14 grams. The estimate is consistent with the portion size relative to the asparagus and the plate, and typical serving sizes of mayonnaise as a condiment."

Comparing the banana to the visible texture and size of the surface beneath it, it appears to be about 10 cm in length. A medium banana typically weighs between 120 to 150 grams with the peel. Since this banana is peeled and about half the size of a whole medium banana, the weight is likely less, around 60 to 80 grams. Considering some moisture loss and the visible density, I estimate this peeled banana piece to weigh about 70 grams."

The ketchup is a smooth, spread-out puddle on the plate, roughly circular and approximately the size of a small coin (about 3-4 cm diameter). Ketchup density and typical serving size suggest that this amount is around 15-20 grams. Given the visual size compared to the potatoes and fish, I estimate the ketchup portion to be about 18 grams, which fits a typical small serving of ketchup on a plate for dipping."

The specified food item is 'poivrons' (red peppers). The image shows a small heap of roasted or grilled red bell pepper slices on the right side of the plate. The pieces appear thinly sliced and slightly charred, which reduces water content and increases density slightly. Given their size and volume, the peppers cover a small area roughly equivalent to a small handful. Usually, 100 grams of raw peppers is roughly a medium pepper, but roasted peppers lose some weight. Considering the visual portion size, which is modest and thinly sliced, I estimate the weight to be in the range of 40-60 grams. The peppers look cooked and soft, which reduces volume but retains weight. Choosing a value slightly in the middle for a moderate portion, I estimate the weight of the poivrons to be approximately 50 grams."

The image shows two slices of toasted bread generously spread with butter and honey. The target food is 'beurre' (butter). Looking closely, the butter appears melted and spread thinly over both slices, with the lower slice having a bit more visible butter. Toasted bread slices typically weigh around 30-35 grams each, so the butterfly spread would be thinner and lighter by comparison. The visible butter likely amounts to about one teaspoon per slice, roughly 5-7 grams per slice, totaling around 10-14 grams combined. Since the task is to estimate weight of butter only (not honey or bread), and the lower slice shows a bit more butter visible, I estimate the total butter amount on both slices to be about 12 grams. The plausible range is roughly 10-14 grams based on the visual thickness and spread coverage."

The image shows a small portion of green salad leaves on a large white plate, with some visible dressing or sauce residues. The leaves appear to be a few torn pieces of lettuce, likely iceberg or similar type, covering a very limited surface area. Considering the low density and the small quantity visible — no more than 5-6 medium-sized leaves — and the fact that the lettuce is coated with some dressing which adds minimal weight, I estimate this portion of 'salade verte avec sauce' to be quite light. Typically, a full small side salad serving is about 50-70 grams, but here it is clearly much less, closer to about 20-30 grams. To be precise, given the visual portion and the dressing, the range is approximately 20-30 grams, so I choose a final estimate of 25 grams, which accounts for the visible leaves and some moisture from the sauce."

The image shows two small solid chocolate bunnies placed on a flat surface. Each bunny is about the size of a small chocolate figurine, roughly comparable to a typical Swiss milk chocolate Easter bunny of miniature size. They are solid, not hollow, which gives them a higher density and weight. By comparing with a standard small solid chocolate figurine of this size—approximately 5-6 cm tall and 3-4 cm wide—the usual weight ranges around 15 to 25 grams per piece. Given the visible size and thickness, I estimate these chocolate bunnies to weigh approximately 20 grams each, as they appear medium-sized and solid rather than hollow or oversized."

The image shows two halves of a bread roll on a white plate. One half has a spread of butter and what appears to be brown molasses ('mélasse'), and the other half has a spread of a darker spread, likely pâte à tartiner. The bread pieces are small rolls typical of Swiss breakfast, and each half is about 50 grams in weight for the bread alone. The layer of molasses spread on the top half of the roll is thin but fully covering the visible surface. Considering the density of molasses, a thin spread over this size of bread half would weigh approximately 10 to 15 grams. Given the coverage and thickness visually estimated to be thin and spread evenly, the molasses portion on the bread is around 12 grams. This estimate fits with typical molasses serving sizes and is plausible given the visible thinness and spread area."

The image shows a black plate with a half peeled banana on the left side. The banana size appears typical for a medium banana, commonly found in Switzerland. A medium banana usually weighs between 110-130 grams including the peel, but the visible part is already peeled and likely weighs less than the whole banana. Given the curved shape and the size relative to the plate and the other food items (like the chocolate chips and oatmeal), this looks like about half of a medium banana without skin. The density and size of a peeled banana piece this size typically correspond to around 60-70 grams. Considering the peeled banana piece shown, I estimate the weight to be approximately 65 grams."

The vinaigre balsamique is a liquid drizzled lightly over the salad, partially coating the visible surface. Considering typical serving and pouring sizes of balsamic vinegar in salads in Switzerland, and the amount visible here—more than a quick drizzle but less than a heavy pour—the quantity likely ranges between 5 to 12 grams. This portion seems closer to a medium pour on this small bowl, so I estimate the vinaigre balsamique to weigh approximately 8 grams, which fits the visible amount without overestimating the density or volume."

The piece of bread appears to be about 10 cm long and 4 cm wide at its widest point, typical of a small slice of baguette or similar bread. The thickness of the bread is approximately 1.5 cm, giving a modest volume. Given the density of bread, this piece likely weighs about 25-30 grams. The chestnut cream is spread over the bread with a moderate thickness, roughly about 3-4 mm. Considering the cream's typical density and spread, the amount of chestnut cream on this piece probably weighs between 15-20 grams. Combining the visual portion size and comparing the cream coverage, the chestnut cream alone is estimated at about 18 grams. This estimate accounts for some variability in spread thickness and density, and fits well with the visible portion size relative to the bread. Therefore, the weight of the chestnut cream ('crème de marrons') on the bread is approximately 18 grams."

Roasted eggplant loses water and shrinks during cooking but still retains some density. Typical raw eggplant slices of this size (about 10-12 cm long and 4-5 cm wide) weigh roughly 70-90 grams each, but roasting reduces water weight by about 30%. Given the visible size and quantity, I estimate each slice weighs approximately 45-55 grams post-roasting. There are three pieces visible, making the total weight range roughly 135-165 grams. Considering the slices are slightly uneven and some smaller pieces are present, a sensible final estimate for the total roasted eggplant on the plate is about 150 grams.

The size of the bread piece is roughly about 8-10 cm in length and 5-6 cm in height, judging by the visible texture of the wood surface and the blurred laptop keys in the background for scale. Typical density of such bread is moderate due to the air pockets. Considering the size and thickness, a piece of bread this size generally weighs around 40-50 grams.

Mozzarella densities vary by type, but this appears to be a soft, fresh mozzarella or possibly a ricotta-like texture. A heaped tablespoon of soft mozzarella typically weighs about 40-60 grams. Given the visible portion size relative to the pasta and beans, it is neither a small smear nor a large block, so estimating it toward the middle of that range is reasonable. Therefore, a total weight estimate of around 50 grams is appropriate. The plausibility check against the other components confirms this is consistent, as the pasta portion is large and the mozzarella serving seems like a complement or topping rather than a main protein component."

Given the small size and sparse distribution (a few small pieces total), the total quantity of onion visible is quite low. Since chopped green onion pieces are light in weight, and there may be approximately 1 to 2 teaspoons worth scattered on the ham slice, the estimated weight would likely be between 3 and 7 grams.

The amount of sauce is not large—it is a thin layer rather than a thick or piled cream. Considering the surface area of each sandwich (about 15-20 cm long), and estimating the average thickness and density of this type of condiment, the total amount of sauce across both sandwiches would be modest. Typical dressings or mayonnaise-based sauces weigh about 0.9 g/ml; judging by the visible quantity, the sauce likely weighs between 15 and 30 grams in total.

The avocado slice on the plate is a single piece approximately one-sixth to one-eighth of a whole avocado. It's thick and firm, with visible volume and density typical of ripe avocado. A whole medium avocado usually weighs about 150 grams. Given this slice appears to be about one-sixth of the avocado, the weight should be around 25 grams. Considering slight variations in thickness and the visible moisture content, a reasonable range would be 20 to 30 grams. Therefore, I estimate the avocado slice weighs approximately 25 grams."

The image shows a hand holding a McFlurry, a known McDonald's dessert served in a small paper cup with a spoon. The McFlurry appears with soft serve ice cream mixed evenly with candy or chocolate pieces. The portion looks typical for a standard McFlurry size, which in Switzerland usually ranges around 150 to 200 grams due to the density of soft serve and mix-ins. The cup looks nearly full to the top, indicating a full serving. Considering the visible fullness, typical product size, and density, a weight estimate near the median standard size of about 180 grams is reasonable."

The specified food item is 'oeuf au plat,' which is clearly visible in the image as a single fried egg with a well-defined yolk and white fully spread on the plate. A typical fried egg from a standard large egg weighs about 50 grams in total (about 30 grams of egg white and 20 grams of yolk). The egg white here looks fully cooked and occupies a moderate area on a standard-sized plate, which matches a typical large egg. The visual thickness and size correspond well with a typical Swiss breakfast fried egg portion. There are no visible additions or substantial visible loss from the egg, so an estimate close to the known average is appropriate. Thus, the plausible weight range is approximately 45-55 grams, with a point estimate of 50 grams being most reasonable."

The image shows a small bowl containing a mixed salad with several identifiable ingredients including green lettuce leaves (salade verte), sliced radishes, tomato chunks, onion pieces, small apple chunks, and balsamic vinegar dressing. The green lettuce portion is intermixed with other ingredients but forms the base layer and some leafy pieces are visible around the edges. Given that lettuce is low density and the volume occupied corresponds to about a small side serving, I estimate the amount of green lettuce to be between 20 and 30 grams. Considering the bowl size and that the greens form just part of the mix, a final weight estimate of 25 grams for the salade verte is reasonable and fits well with the proportions of other salad ingredients."

The avocado is clearly visible as two slices on top of the wrap along with other ingredients. Considering the size of the wrap, which is likely around 20-22 cm in diameter, the avocado pieces appear to represent approximately a quarter of a medium avocado. A whole medium avocado typically weighs about 150-170 grams including skin and pit, and the edible portion is about 130 grams. Given the visual size of the slices, the avocado portion shown seems to be about 30-40 grams. Accounting for some variance in thickness and exact slice size, I estimate the weight of the avocado to be approximately 35 grams."

The image shows three pieces of bread on a small plate, two of which have a visible spread of butter ('beurre'). The butter appears to be spread moderately but not thickly—covering most of the bread surface in a thin layer. Given typical spreading thickness and the visible coverage on two small bread pieces, the total butter amount is modest. Each piece likely holds about 5-6 grams of butter, combining for approximately 11-12 grams in total. Given that the prompt indicates 'beurre' as one food item, I estimate the butter weight on the plate to be about 12 grams, considering a plausible range of 10-14 grams."

The waffle is about the size of a standard homemade or store-bought square waffle, roughly 12 cm by 12 cm, with a typical thickness of about 1.5 to 2 cm. Waffles of this size typically weigh between 90 and 110 grams. The chocolate spread covers parts of the surface in a thin layer, some areas are bare, some have moderate coverage inside the waffle squares. Given that chocolate spread is dense and viscous but applied thinly here, the amount looks like approximately 10 to 15 grams. Considering the visible coverage and common serving sizes for spreading on waffles, the plausible range is 8-18 grams, with a final estimate around 12 grams. This value fits the amount visually spread without overestimating overly thick application. The plate size and waffle size comparisons also support this moderate amount estimation."

The image shows a single slice of toasted bread (tartine) with a spread of chestnut cream (crème de marrons) and visible patches of butter spread on it. The bread slice is a small to medium portion, roughly the size of a typical small slice of country or rustic bread, weighing approximately 25-30 grams when toasted. The butter portions appear thinly spread, likely about 5-8 grams. The chestnut cream layer is also moderately thin but covers most of the bread, suggesting around 15-20 grams. Combining these components, the total weight of the tartine with chestnut cream and butter is approximately between 45 and 55 grams. Considering some margin for spread irregularity and crumb texture, I estimate the weight to be about 50 grams."

The butter is spread thinly over roughly half to two-thirds of the slice of bread. The bread is a typical rustic slice, about 10 cm long and 7-8 cm wide, and about 1.5 cm thick. A medium thin layer of butter spread this way usually weighs between 8 and 12 grams based on typical Swiss portion estimates and visual thickness. The butter here is not heavily piled but also not scarcely spread, so I estimate about 10 grams. The range of 8-12 grams fits this spread thickness and surface area well."

Given that the pecans appear whole and are not broken, and considering the volume they occupy on top of the fruit and yogurt, the total weight likely falls within the range of 20-30 grams. Taking a medium estimate within this range to reflect the size and density of the nuts, I estimate the weight of the pecan nuts to be approximately 25 grams."

The specified food is 'oeuf' (egg), which is clearly visible in the lower left part of the plate. The scrambled egg portion covers a small area and is moderately dense but broken up into small pieces. Given that one medium egg weighs about 50 grams, and the amount here appears roughly to be a single egg, but slightly reduced possibly due to cooking loss or incomplete portion, I estimate the portion weight of the cooked egg to be between 35 and 45 grams. Considering typical density and volume, I choose an estimate of 40 grams. This fits well with the relative sizes of the other items and the plate dimensions."

The sauce aux champignons is visible as the creamy mushroom sauce coating the pasta pieces. The bowl appears to be medium sized, and the sauce is mixed in with the pasta rather than presented separately, so we need to focus on the mushroom sauce specifically. The mushrooms themselves are visible in slices and chunks, about 8-10 pieces in total, coated in a creamy, slightly thick sauce. Typical creamy mushroom sauces are moderately dense but lighter than pure cream due to the mushrooms and some air incorporated. Considering the volume of sauce visible coating the pasta and the mushrooms, it seems to cover roughly 150-200 grams of pasta. Given the sauce is integrated and only part of the total portion, the sauce component would be smaller, weighing both mushroom pieces and the creamy liquid. Estimating the mushroom pieces at about 50-60 grams and the creamy liquid adding another 40-50 grams, the total sauce aux champignons should weigh between roughly 90 and 110 grams. The portion looks medium in size, so choosing a midpoint estimation, the weight is around 100 grams. This is consistent also with the visible volume relative to the pasta and zucchini gratinée in the bowl."

Focusing on the mayonnaise, it appears to be spread fairly thinly but evenly over the surface of one slice of bread. Typical homemade or store-bought mayonnaise spread in this quantity on a single slice of bread usually weighs between 10 and 15 grams because mayonnaise is dense and fatty but spread in a thin layer. Given the visible coverage, I estimate the mayonnaise weight to be closer to the lower-middle part of this range, around 12 grams. This fits well with the visual thickness and distribution of the mayonnaise on the slice and is consistent with the modest sandwich size shown."

The image shows two fried eggs (œufs au plat) on a plate accompanied by broccoli and semoule (couscous). Each fried egg typically weighs about 50 grams for a whole egg including the white and yolk. The two eggs look nearly whole but the yolk of one egg is slightly broken or partially lost which might slightly reduce total weight. They are seasoned and cooked, which usually causes minor weight loss mainly from water evaporation. Taking this into account, each fried egg portion here is likely around 45-50 grams. For two eggs together, an estimated weight range would be around 90-100 grams. Considering the visible size, and the standard size of eggs in Switzerland, I estimate the combined weight of the two fried eggs (œufs au plat) to be approximately 95 grams."

The image shows two small bread rolls labeled as 'pains aux noix' (walnut breads) next to a banana, which provides a good scale reference. These breads are smaller than a typical large bread roll, roughly the size of a small fist or about 8-9 cm in diameter. Typical small walnut bread rolls in Swiss bakery portions weigh approximately 70-90 grams each. Given the size and the visible density (semi-crusty bread with embedded walnuts), I estimate these to be on the lighter side of that range due to their smaller size and the presence of walnuts which add some weight but also air pockets. The two rolls appear similar in size and density, so estimating per roll at about 80 grams is reasonable. Since the target food is a single 'pain aux noix', the estimated weight for one is about 80 grams."

A standard freshly baked croissant au chocolat from a European bakery typically weighs between 70 and 90 grams due to the layered buttery dough and chocolate filling. Given that this croissant is mostly intact, medium size, and dense with nuts and chocolate, the weight estimate should be around 80 grams.

Given the typical density of granola/muesli and the visible volume, the cereal portion seems moderate and not a large heaping serving but neither a small one. Considering Swiss portion sizes, a medium bowl of granola cereal typically ranges around 40-60 grams dry weight. Considering the milk displacement, the cereal weight is on the lower side of that range but not minimal. Therefore, estimating about 50 grams is a reasonable value. The plausible range would be 40-60 grams to allow for slight over- or under-filling, final estimate at about 50 grams."

The pesto spread covering the bread seems to be a thin to moderate layer, adding approximately 5 grams per slice. Given the three pieces, the total weight for all bread with pesto is roughly 45-60 grams. Since the target is one ""pain tartiné au pesto"" slice, the weight should be about one third of that range, i.e., approximately 15-20 grams.

Given the appearance of typical brown ragout sauce, which is mostly liquid with some dissolved solids, I estimate the sauce portion to be moderate but not excessive — roughly covering about 50-70 ml in volume. This volume converts to around 50-70 grams, as dense as water-based liquids, slightly more due to dissolved ingredients. The sauce is not pooled deeply but forms a visible wet layer around the plate contents. Therefore, a reasonable estimated weight range for the sauce portion visible would be 50 to 70 grams, with a final estimation in the middle at about 60 grams."

The image shows a handful of cashew nuts (noix de cajou) held in one hand. Typically, a single cashew nut weighs about 1.3 to 1.5 grams depending on size and density. There are approximately 20 to 22 cashew nuts visible in the hand. Multiplying the number of nuts by the average individual weight gives a range from roughly 26 grams (20 x 1.3g) to 33 grams (22 x 1.5g). Considering the nuts are slightly varying in size and the handful is not tightly packed but comfortably held, the final estimated weight of the visible portion is about 30 grams."

The image shows a plate with a portion of mixed rice that includes some visible grains and small vegetable pieces like carrots. The rice portion covers roughly one quarter of the plate, forming a dense but not tightly packed pile. The rice looks cooked and somewhat fluffy with a moderate volume. Considering typical portion sizes in Switzerland and the visual amount, small to medium size, the rice portion likely weighs between 130 and 170 grams. Given this is a moderate serving alongside meat, fennel, and two asparagus, I estimate the rice weight to be approximately 150 grams."
