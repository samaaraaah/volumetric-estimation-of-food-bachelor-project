xjvrtk,courgette et oignons,300.0,95,205.0,6.541857249228806,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is 'courgette et oignons' located on the left side of the container. The visible amount consists of a mix of chopped courgette (zucchini) pieces and sliced onions. The pieces are fairly small and layered throughout the depth of the container. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The container is about 12 cm wide based on common glassware size. The courgette and onions occupy roughly half of the container's volume. Estimated surface area for this mixture is approximately 7 x 7 cm and a depth of about 2.5 cm. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cooked courgettes and onions retain medium density despite some water loss when cooked. Their density is closer to cooked vegetables, roughly 0.8 g/cm3. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - This is a relatively modest portion, not overly full, so leaning towards a medium-sized portion. Volume calculation: 7 cm x 7 cm x 2.5 cm = 122.5 cm3. Using density 0.8 g/cm3 gives an approximate weight of 98 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - Compared to the galettes on the right, which look dense and heavy, the courgette and onion mixture is lighter and less compact, so this estimate remains logically consistent. Step 6: Systematic Bias Check - The mix appears moist but not watery, estimating slightly under 100 g is reasonable without including container weight. Final estimated weight for 'courgette et oignons' is about 95 grams based on visual volume, density, and portion size."
xjvrtk,tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe,250.0,90,160.0,4.25486650356345,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/f607625b-a07d-423e-a564-4d96ebadf084,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is 'tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe', a fruit tart with a thin crust topped with diced apple and rhubarb pieces. The image shows one large slice on a standard dessert plate. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The plate is a typical small dessert plate about 19-20 cm in diameter. The tart slice occupies roughly one quarter of a standard rectangular tart, estimated around 18-20 cm square, making the slice about 9-10 cm on each side. The topping, diced apple and rhubarb, appears to be spread about 0.8-1 cm thick on a thin crust about 2-3 mm thick. Step 3: Density Considerations - Apples and rhubarb cooked tend to retain density; the crust is thin and lighter. The distribution of fruit topping is uniform and visible. The fruit density suggests moderate heaviness but the portion is thin overall. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - A full tarte flambée of this size with fruit topping typically weighs around 350-400g. This slice is about 1/4 of that, so total 85-100g. Considering the thin crust and light topping, this slice is close to a medium serving for Swiss portions. Step 5: Cross Validation - The tart on the plate looks consistent with a light to medium portion size with no extra topping or thick dough. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - No other foods on the plate to compare with, but plate size confirms slice weight. Final estimate: 90g is a reasonable estimation matching visual evidence and density. This excludes any plate weight or other containers."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,260,157.0,6.9640463780448885,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: The target food is 'salade de tomates,' which are the sliced tomatoes visible on the plate. The salad is composed mainly of tomato wedges and slices with some green herbs and sprinkled linseeds and balsamic vinegar on top, which we exclude from the weight estimate. Step 2: The plate dimension is standard (approx. 20-22 cm diameter), and the tomato slices cover most of the plate surface, arranged in one visible layer with some slight overlap. Step 3: A medium tomato weighs around 130-150 grams whole. These slices are from about 2 medium tomatoes, given the amount and slice thickness. The tomatoes seem fresh and firm, typical density for tomatoes is about 0.9 g/cm3. Step 4: Considering the tomatoes are sliced and spread, the total volume corresponds to approximately 2 medium tomatoes. Step 5: The visible tomato portion is medium-sized for a Swiss meal side salad portion. No hidden tomatoes underneath, only a single layer is visible. Step 6: Cross-validation with the size of the plate and cutlery confirms the quantity is reasonable and not exceptionally large. The linseeds and dressing do not affect tomato weight. Thus, estimating about 260 grams for the sliced tomatoes is accurate and consistent with visual evidence and typical portion sizes. No container weight included."
2ahgvr,porridge salé,48.0,200,152.0,0.7760876502499734,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a35f3211-3b33-4826-97b8-3af69655dada,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is 'porridge salé' visible inside a small glass jar with a metal lid. The porridge appears to be cooked and fills approximately 85% of the jar volume. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The jar diameter is about 70 mm (7 cm) per the lid marking. Assuming the jar height is similar to the lid diameter and about 7-8 cm tall. The porridge volume fills roughly to 6 cm height inside the jar with a diameter of 7 cm. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cooked porridge (oat-based) is dense and moist. Cooked oats have a density around 0.8 to 1.0 g/cm3. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Calculate volume: Volume of cylindrical portion = π * r^2 * h = 3.14 * (3.5 cm)^2 * 6 cm = approx 230 cm3. Using a density of 0.9 g/cm3, estimated weight is roughly 230 * 0.9 = 207 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The porridge quantity fits a small Swiss portion size which is reasonable for a snack or small meal. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - No other foods to compare. Final consideration: Jar volume and visual fullness respected; cooking state considered; density realistic for cooked savory porridge. Therefore, estimate is close to 200 grams. Conservatively adjusting slightly lower due to jar shape and incomplete fill, final estimate is 200 grams."
p96w4a,délice tomate mozzarella,54.0,200,146.0,0.8386341878523561,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/5ebafbd6-315d-44a6-8508-ba143d23adb2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is ""délice tomate mozzarella,"" which is the layered salad of sliced tomato and mozzarella cheese on the left side of the plate. There appear to be 6 tomato slices alternating with 5 mozzarella slices. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Tomatoes slices are about 1 cm thick each, mozzarella slices slightly thicker, estimated about 1.2 cm each. The slices are slightly overlapping but mostly stacked side by side. The length of the entire stack is about 15 cm and width of slices approximately 5-6 cm. Depth appears minimal, about 1.2 cm since slices are laid flat. Step 3: Density Considerations - Tomatoes are relatively light but with skin, and mozzarella is a dense fresh cheese. Tomato density ~0.95 g/cm³ and mozzarella closer to 1.1 g/cm³. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - In Swiss portion context, 6 tomato slices and 5 mozzarella slices represent a medium portion. Step 5: Cross-validation - The other item on the plate is a single piece of bread or pastry, approximately 60g, appearing lighter in volume than the délice tomate mozzarella. Volume estimate: Single tomato slice approx 5 cm x 5 cm x 1 cm = 25 cm³, 6 slices = 150 cm³; multiplied by density 0.95 g/cm³ = 143g. Single mozzarella slice approx 5 cm x 5 cm x 1.2 cm = 30 cm³, 5 slices = 150 cm³; times density 1.1 g/cm³ = 165g. Total estimated weight = 143 + 165 = 308g. This seems large, so adjusting for overlap and some air gaps, reducing by about 35%. Final estimated weight ~200g, a medium serving. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - The délice fills almost half the plate surface in length and is thicker than the bread piece next to it, supporting the 200g estimate. No container weight included. Therefore, the estimation for délice tomate mozzarella is 200 grams."
p8a2w5,dahl de lentille,281.0,160,121.0,3.616742899691522,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/5ddea52e-8411-4822-893f-d8420fa6cb40,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'dahl de lentille' (lentil dahl). Visually, this is an orange lentil-based cooked dish mixed with rice in a white bowl on a table. The lentils and vegetables form a cohesive, moderately dense semi-solid mixture piled inside a medium-sized bowl. The bowl itself seems roughly standard-sized for a small serving, estimated around 12-14 cm diameter and about 5-6 cm deep. The lentil dahl occupies just over half of the bowl's visible volume, resting on top of or mixed with a smaller amount of white rice. Given the dahl's appearance, it likely has medium density—cooked lentils and vegetables hold some moisture but are not as dense as plain cooked rice or thick meat. Considering Swiss portion sizes, which tend to be smaller, the dahl portion looks like a moderate single serving with a volume of approximately 150-200 ml. Lentil dahl density is roughly 0.9 g/ml due to blending and moisture. Thus, the weight estimate is in the range 135g (small portion) to 180g (medium portion). Since it's a visible full moderate serving, I lean towards the medium portion estimate around 160g. Cross-validating against the rice portion below, the dahl portion appears visually about twice the volume of the rice portion, consistent with this weight estimation."
xjvrtk,thon,100.0,220,120.0,1.2764599510690353,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/611431d0-f119-4ef8-ad73-bb27c5075c3c,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, the target food is 'thon' (tuna). The tuna is visible as pinkish chunks dispersed throughout the dish. Step 1, visual identification: I count approximately 10-12 visible tuna chunks, some partially hidden but overall well mixed with couscous and cucumber pieces. Step 2, dimension analysis: The container is likely about a 1-liter glass container. The tuna chunks are about 2-3 cm each on average with thickness. Tuna flakes are denser and heavier than couscous or vegetables, so each piece likely weighs more than it looks volumetrically. Step 3, density considerations: Tuna in flakes or chunks has a density around 1 g/cm³ or slightly more. Step 4, portion size calibration: Since the tuna is dispersed throughout the dish and about 25-30% of the visible volume appears to be tuna, estimate total volume of tuna about 200-250 ml. Given density ~1 g/cm³, weight should be close to volume in grams, so between 200 and 250 grams. Step 5, cross-validation: The couscous and cucumber take remaining volume. The tuna amount looks like a medium portion in Swiss context, so I pick mid-range estimate. Step 6, relative weight validation: The tuna amount is less than couscous but still substantial. So overall, I estimate tuna weight at approximately 220 grams to be a realistic and grounded estimation based on the image."
p96w4a,purée de pdt,214.0,100,114.0,2.5950430805233484,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/828972fc-fa12-4270-a960-fc59367fc91e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is 'purée de pdt' (mashed potatoes). It is the white, creamy portion underneath the meat ragout, carrots, and sauce, centrally placed on the plate. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The mashed potatoes cover an approximate area of half the plate diameter, with a somewhat thick spread. The plate looks like a standard dinner plate (~25 cm diameter). The mashed potatoes layer appears roughly oval, about 10 cm by 7 cm, with an estimated average thickness of about 1.5 cm. Step 3: Density Considerations - Mashed potatoes have a density about 0.9 g/cm3, slightly less than water, due to incorporated air and milk. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The quantity looks like a medium portion as per Swiss serving sizes, not excessively heaped but substantial enough in thickness and area. Step 5: Cross-validation - The other items like meat and carrots are small in volume compared to the mashed potatoes. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - The mashed potatoes cover a larger volume than carrots and meat. Calculating volume: approx 10 cm x 7 cm x 1.5 cm = 105 cm3. Multiplying by density (0.9 g/cm3) gives approximately 95 grams. Accounting for slight compression and hidden parts, estimate about 100 grams as a round figure, fitting a medium Swiss portion. This weight excludes the sauce and other items, adhering to the instruction of no container weight included."
p8a2w5,"dalh de lentilles corail (lentilles corail, oignon, carottes, tomates concassées, 1cs huilde d'olive, épices)",271.0,160,111.0,3.199765982342304,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/82b53493-1c97-472b-9ec6-8cc698b8cfe4,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is ""dalh de lentilles corail"". Step 1: Visual Identification: The dalh is the orange portion on the right side of the bowl. It appears to be a thick stew containing lentils, carrots, onions, and tomatoes. Step 2: Dimension Analysis: The bowl itself looks like a standard cereal or soup bowl, approximately 15 cm in diameter. Dalh occupies roughly half the bowl surface area, with a depth approximately equivalent to the bowl's depth, about 4-5 cm. It is piled somewhat thickly with some apparent density from lentils and vegetables. Step 3: Density Considerations: Cooked lentils and vegetables form a dense, moist mass with a density roughly around 0.85-1 g/cm3. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration: The dalh portion is medium-sized, not overflowing but filling half the bowl with some depth. Step 5: Cross-validation: Compared to the rice half, which visually looks like about 120-140 g cooked rice, the dalh is about the same volume or slightly less but denser. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation: Given the visible volume, I estimate about 150-170 g of dalh. Selecting conservatively, final estimate: 160 g."
ppf8hc,boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate,316.0,220,96.0,3.226890756302521,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/bf22a1b3-a8b6-4823-a44b-0893c3097763,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is 'boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate' (vegetable meatballs in tomato sauce). In the image, I can count 10 clearly visible vegetable meatballs spread mostly on and around the pasta. They vary slightly in size but are fairly uniform. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each boulettes seems to be approximately 3-4 cm in diameter, roughly spherical. Comparing to the pen knife on the right, the size is moderate, roughly the size of a walnut. Step 3: Density Considerations - Vegetable meatballs are dense but lighter than meat meatballs due to vegetable content. Typical density of such vegetable-based meatballs is about 0.9 g/cm3 to 1.1 g/cm3, close to meat but slightly lighter. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Since there are 10 meatballs, each approximately the size of a small walnut (about 20-25g per meatball on average in Swiss portion sizes), the total weight would be between 200g and 250g if each meatball is around 20-25g. Given that these are vegetable meatballs which might be slightly lighter than meat versions, I will estimate towards the lower-middle range, i.e., around 22g per meatball. Step 5: Cross Validation - The meatballs appear about half or slightly more the weight of the pasta portion (average Swiss portion of pasta is around 140-150 g cooked). The meatball portion looks substantial but not overly large compared to pasta. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - 22g x 10 meatballs = 220g seems consistent with the visual volume and Swiss portion sizes. The meatballs have tomato sauce coating but container weight is excluded as required. Therefore, final estimate for the vegetable meatballs in tomato sauce is 220 grams."
p8a2w5,artichaut,143.0,230,87.0,1.3233698542708223,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/9b2c7383-a434-4260-ac30-86103e4546ea,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: The target food item is 'artichaut' (artichoke). There is one whole artichoke on the plate, clearly visible and not mixed or layered. Step 2: Dimension analysis shows the artichoke is a medium size, roughly 10-12 cm in length, resting on a standard dinner plate (approx. 27 cm diameter) which provides size reference. The artichoke is about one-third the plate's diameter across its widest point. The thickness is moderate, judging by the visible leaves and overall bulk. Step 3: Artichokes are dense vegetables, with tough leaves and a solid heart, so density considerations indicate the actual weight is relatively large for the size shown. Step 4: Considering standard Swiss portion sizes, a medium whole artichoke typically weighs between 180-270 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation with other items is limited, but the sauce portion is minimal and does not affect estimation. Step 6: Relative weight validation is consistent, as artichoke is a single compact vegetable, not over or under-counted. Considering these points and the plate size as a reliable scale, the estimate should be near the medium range around 230 grams for this artichoke, avoiding overestimating or underestimating given the visual volume and density. Final estimation is 230 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is 'pâtes carbonara', visible as penne pasta with cream sauce and bacon pieces on a standard-sized dinner plate. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The pasta portion covers a moderate area in the middle of the plate, with pasta scattered and slightly piled. The pasta pieces appear cooked and coated in sauce, with some bacon bits mixed in. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cooked pasta with sauce and meat is dense; cream-based carbonara is heavier than plain pasta alone due to sauce and meat. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The portion looks medium-sized, typical for a Swiss meal, likely smaller than a US portion. Estimating: a typical medium Swiss pasta portion ranges around 140 to 160 grams cooked. Step 5: Cross-validation - Comparing size to plate diameter (~26 cm), the pasta patch is less than half the plate area, consistent with ~150g cooked pasta. The small amount of bacon does not skew weight much. Step 6: Relative weight validation - There is no significant competing food in the image. Conclusion: estimate roughly 150 grams for the cooked pâtes carbonara portion, excluding any cheese on top as it is not requested and separately listed. Final estimation: 150 grams."
xjvrtk,ananas,200.0,280,80.0,1.7019466014253803,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/b41068f9-5a0e-4c11-bf1b-7389d3917889,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, the target food item is 'ananas' (pineapple). I locate the pineapple pieces on the blue plate. There are approximately 12 individual chunks of pineapple, each roughly similar in size. Each piece appears to be a triangular segment typical of fresh pineapple chunks, about 3-4 cm in length and 2-3 cm in thickness. Pineapple is a dense juicy fruit, moderately heavy for its size. Given the size of the plate and the pieces relative to it, these pieces cover a small mound of pineapple, not very piled up. Each piece likely weighs between 20-30 grams given their volume. Multiplying by 12 pieces yields an estimated total weight range of about 240-360 grams. Considering a medium Swiss portion size and that the chunks are not overly thick, a conservative estimate near the mid to lower-middle range is appropriate, around 280 grams. There is no container weight included, and no skin is present, only the edible pineapple flesh. Thus, the estimated weight of the pineapple chunks on the plate is approximately 280 grams."
xjvrtk,boulgour,170.0,95,75.0,1.3562386980108498,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/d8aaea52-09df-4596-892c-0d03f5b6b9cd,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visually identify boulgour in the image—it is the light beige grain portion at the bottom left of the container. It is distinct and occupies roughly one fourth of the container's base. Step 2: Dimension analysis—comparing the size of the container and the adjacent items, the glass container seems to be approximately 15 cm square. The boulgour portion covers an area about 7x7 cm and is piled with an estimated depth of about 1.5 cm. Step 3: Density considerations—cooked boulgour is a dense, hydrated grain; typical cooked density is ~130 g per 100 cm3. Step 4: Portion size calibration—volume roughly 7 cm x 7 cm x 1.5 cm = 73.5 cm3. Weight estimate is 73.5 cm3 x 1.3 g/cm3 ≈ 95.5 g. Step 5: Cross-validation—comparing with the adjacent ratatouille portion (vegetables, less dense) and two egg halves, this weight seems consistent as a moderate portion in Swiss context. Step 6: Systematic bias check—no visible underestimation; the volume is well contained and the portion is neither overpacked nor sparse. Thus, an estimate of about 95 grams is reasonable."
wrah5h,tiramisu,72.0,145,73.0,0.5590894585682374,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/7b0475df-5b02-4072-abb9-ef75acf0f031,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, the target food item is 'tiramisu,' located on the left side of the plate. It is a single slice of a classic tiramisu, identifiable by its layered structure of soaked sponge cake and creamy mascarpone filling, topped with cocoa powder. The slice appears moist and relatively dense, with some cream and soaked cake layers visible. Visually comparing the tiramisu slice to the neighboring forêt noir slice and the plate size, the tiramisu slice is about 10 cm long, 4 cm wide, and approximately 3.5 cm thick. The depth is estimated accounting for the volume of the layered cream and cake structure, considering some slight compression. Typical tiramisu density is moderately heavy due to soaked cake and cream layers; a 10x4x3.5 cm volume equals about 140 cm3. Given the density of a tiramisu is roughly 0.9 to 1.1 g/cm3 because of the creamy and soaked cake composition, the estimated weight range is about 130 to 155 grams. Considering the portion size is average for Swiss dessert serving (medium portion), I select the middle of the range. Thus, the tiramisu slice likely weighs about 145 grams."

Step 1: Visual identification – the target food is ‘fraises’ (strawberries). There are clearly 3 strawberries in a small green bowl. Step 2: Dimension analysis – the bowl size looks small, probably a small dessert bowl, about 10-12 cm in diameter. Each strawberry is large for Swiss standards, with the biggest about 6-7 cm long and thick, the others slightly smaller but still of above-average size. Depth is typical for strawberries, roughly conical but fairly solid. Step 3: Density – strawberries are mostly water, relatively light but still dense compared to leafy vegetables. Average whole medium strawberry in Swiss portions is around 15-20g. These look somewhat larger than average, so each about 25-30g. Step 4: Portion size calibration – total 3 strawberries, estimating 25-30g each gives 75-90g total. Step 5: Cross-validation – comparing to the bowl size, volume seems reasonable for about 80g. No other foods to compare to. Step 6: Bias check – unlikely to overestimate, no container weight included. The three strawberries combined likely weigh about 80g, adjusted slightly lower due to visual softness and possible hollow parts inside. Final estimate: 80 grams total for the 3 strawberries."
xjvrtk,kiwi,120.0,60,60.0,0.7658759706414211,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/7d1aaf24-b020-4315-aa15-db38f40e72be,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'kiwi'. Step 1: Visual Identification - The kiwi is cut into about 15 individual pieces distributed over half of a small bowl. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The bowl appears to be a standard small dessert bowl (approx. 12-14 cm diameter). Each kiwi slice is roughly 2-3 cm in size and about 1 cm thick, suggesting a moderate volume. The kiwis are piled to a shallow depth (~1-2 cm). Step 3: Density Considerations - Kiwi is a juicy fruit with moderate density, approximately 0.9 g/cm³. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The visible quantity seems like approximately half to two-thirds of a medium kiwi fruit, as one whole medium kiwi weighs around 70-80 grams including skin, but here only flesh is present without skin. Adjusted for peeled and cut pieces, flesh weight is about 60 grams for a medium kiwi. Step 5: Cross-Validation - No other fruit visible for direct comparison, but we see the relative volume compared to the bowl and séré maigre which is relatively dense and similar volume. Considering the total visible kiwi volume, I estimate it weighs about 60 grams. Step 6: Systematic Bias Check - The kiwi pieces are ample but not heaped deeply, so overestimation is avoided. The skin is removed, so no added weight there. The estimate is consistent with common portion sizes in Swiss context, which tends to be moderate. Therefore, the best estimate for the kiwi weight is 60 grams."

Step 1: The target food is 'riz' (rice). Visually, it occupies about half of the bowl. Step 2: The bowl is a typical size, likely around 15 cm diameter, and the rice portion appears compact, cooked white rice with visible grains. Step 3: Cooked rice is dense and compact; a medium bowl portion can vary between 100-150g. Step 4: Given this is a Swiss portion context, and the rice is filling roughly half the bowl, I estimate the rice amount as a medium portion, closer to 130g. Step 5: Cross-checking with the dalh portion which looks sauce-heavy and less dense, rice seems heavier but not overwhelmingly so, consistent with 130g rice. Step 6: No container weight included, and rice is well defined without mixing. Thus, the estimate is 130 grams."
wrah5h,gaufre à la patate douce,85.0,140,55.0,0.4972875226039783,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1876b0b6-568d-4583-8186-073df252e6c9,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. STEP 1: The target food is 'gaufre à la patate douce' (sweet potato waffle). In the image, there are four pieces of waffle, each roughly quarter segments of a larger waffle. Each piece has visible thickness typical of a waffle, approximately 1.5-2 cm. STEP 2: Dimension analysis shows each piece is about 7 cm by 7 cm, given the plate size and standard waffle grid size. Total waffle area is about 14 cm by 14 cm if whole, cut into four equal parts. Thickness is standard for homemade sweet potato waffles, estimated 1.5 cm to 2 cm. STEP 3: Density considerations — sweet potato waffles are denser than regular waffles due to the sweet potato but lighter than pure meat or cheese. Sweet potato has moderate moisture content, resulting in moderate density. STEP 4: Portion size calibration — a full sweet potato waffle of about 14 x 14 cm and 1.5-2 cm thick generally weighs between 120-160 grams. Seeing four equal pieces, the total waffle is approximately the full portion on the plate. STEP 5: Cross-validation — compared to smoked salmon slices which look thin and light (~15 g total), the waffle is much denser and heavier, consistent with 120-160 g total. The sauce and other toppings are excluded as per instructions. STEP 6: Final estimate — given the exact size, thickness, and density, a reasonable and conservative weight estimate for the whole waffle is about 140 grams. This accounts for the Swiss portion size, which tends toward moderate serving sizes. Therefore, the weight of the 'gaufre à la patate douce' is estimated at 140 grams."
p8a2w5,tarte aux fraises,164.0,110,54.0,0.942027443888948,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/7b64b358-b611-4155-8e79-6f3ce5b4f11a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is 'tarte aux fraises' which is a strawberry tart slice. The image shows one slice with 6 visible strawberry halves (3 whole strawberries cut in half), some red currants, a layer of cream, and a thin tart base. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The plate is a standard dessert plate (~20cm diameter) which helps scale the tart slice as roughly 10 cm long and about 5 cm at its widest point. The depth/thickness of the tart slice is about 2.5-3 cm, including crust, cream, and fruit. Step 3: Density Considerations - The tart base is likely a dense pastry but relatively thin. The cream layer is medium density, and strawberries and currants are light but with skin adding some weight. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - A typical slice of strawberry tart in Switzerland is small to medium sized, around 100-130 grams for a normal portion. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Compared to the plate and considering the strawberry size, the slice seems moderate in size. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - No other foods to compare here. Conclusion: Accounting for the crust base (~30g), cream (~40g), and fruit (~40g), a reasonable estimate is mid-range between 105-115g, so approximately 110g. This is consistent with Swiss portion sizes and the visible food volume on the plate."

Step 1: Visually identify the tomato pieces located on the left side of the container. The tomato is sliced and partially visible, with roughly 2-3 medium-sized slices shown. Step 2: The tomato slices are approximately 1 cm thick, and the combined area roughly matches a medium tomato cut into a few slices. Step 3: Considering tomato density is close to water (about 1 g/cm³), the visible volume is estimated. Each slice around 7 cm long by 5 cm wide by 1 cm thick equals approximately 35 cm³ per slice, multiplied by 3 slices makes about 105 cm³, roughly 100 g. Step 4: Given this is a typical Swiss lunch portion, the portion size looks medium, not large or very small. Step 5: Cross-validate relative to other components - tomato quantity looks less than quinoa but more than individual carrot shreds, consistent with ~100g. Step 6: No container weight included, and only visible tomato parts counted. Hence the estimated tomato weight is about 100 grams."

Step 1: The target food is clearly identified as 'pain aux fruits', which is visible in the image being held between fingers. It appears as a small piece or slice of fruit bread. Step 2: Dimension analysis: Comparing it against the fingers holding it, the bread piece is roughly 6 cm long, about 4 cm wide, and approximately 2 cm thick. Step 3: Density considerations: Fruit bread is moderately dense due to dried fruits and nuts; it is not as dense as pure meat but more compact than a slice of cake. Step 4: Portion size calibration: This piece is relatively small, likely a partial slice of a larger loaf. A full slice of pain aux fruits may weigh around 80-100g, but this fragment is smaller, maybe about half to two-thirds of a full slice in volume. Step 5: Cross-validation: There is no other food to compare here, but relative to a standard slice of bread, this is a dense, enriched bread smaller than usual. Step 6: Systematic bias check: The piece is thick and compact, with visible dried fruit and nuts contributing to weight, so the estimate should be on the middle range of a smaller slice. Taking all this into account, a reasonable estimation for this piece is about 50 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food, céréales, is the breakfast cereal pieces in the bowl partially soaked in milk. The cereal pieces are small, irregular clusters and some larger pieces with chocolate flakes. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The bowl is an average-sized bowl (~15-18 cm diameter) and the cereal covers the bottom with milk filling about halfway. The cereal layer is thin but spread out; depth is likely less than 1 cm due to milk immersion and typical cereal volume. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cereal is relatively light and airy. Even soaked, it does not compact to very dense mass. Typical dry cereal density is low, but here it is slightly hydrated. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - For Swiss portions, a medium cereal portion is about 30-40 grams dry. Given this is already partially soaked and visually modest, estimate closer to 30 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - Comparing cereal to the spoon size and bowl, the volume matches roughly 30 grams dry weight. No other food to compare with here. Step 6: Systematic bias check - Not overestimating due to visible thin layer and typical cereal volume. Not underestimating since coverage is moderate. Final estimate: about 30 grams of cereal dry weight is presented in this bowl."

Step 1: The target food is 'fondant au chocolat maison,' a single slice visible on a plate. Step 2: The slice length is about 12-13 cm, with a base width of roughly 6-7 cm. The thickness appears around 3-4 cm, judging by the side profile. The plate and the coffee cup in the photo provide size references. Step 3: Fondant au chocolat is a dense chocolate cake with a moist interior, so density is relatively high compared to a light cake. Step 4: Standard portions of chocolate fondant slices at Swiss servings range around 100-140 grams for a dessert size slice. This slice looks like a medium portion, not too thick or thin, and compact. Step 5: Cross-validating with typical calorie estimates for chocolate fondant slices, the weight matches a portion in the 110-130 g range. Step 6: No other foods are visible for relative comparisons. Conclusion: Choosing a medium portion weight, conservative and visually consistent estimate is 120 grams."

Step 1: The target food item is 'délice des dieux (biscuit, fruits rouges, séré+mascarpone)' which is a layered dessert consisting of a biscuit base, red berries (fruits rouges), and a cream layer made of séré and mascarpone. Visually, the portion is one moderate slice on a small dessert plate. Step 2: Dimension analysis - The plate diameter appears to be around 18 cm (typical dessert plate). The slice roughly covers an area of about 8x6 cm. The thickness is about 2.5 to 3 cm considering the cream layer and the biscuit base. Step 3: Density considerations - The biscuit base is moderately dense, fruits rouges are lighter but contribute moisture and some weight, and the cream layer (séré + mascarpone) is creamy but relatively dense. Step 4: Portion size calibration - For a Swiss dessert portion, this size corresponds to a medium-sized slice. Estimating approximate weight: biscuit base (around 50g), cream layer (about 90g), fruits rouges incorporated (around 20g). Adding these, total weight is approximately 160g. Step 5: Cross-validation - The size relative to the plate and berries on top (blueberries approx 1-1.5g each, raspberries ~3-4g each) aligns well with this estimate. Step 6: Relative weight validation - The dessert is a single piece without additional foods for comparison, but the weight fits general expectations for a dessert serving of this type. Therefore, conservatively estimating the total weight of the délice des dieux slice as 160 grams to reflect the portion size and layer densities accurately."

Step 1: The target food item is 'gaufre' (waffle), which is the rectangular, grid-patterned baked food visible on the plate underneath the applesauce. Step 2: Dimension analysis - the waffle appears to be about the size of a standard small to medium breakfast waffle, roughly 10 cm by 8 cm, with a thickness of about 1.5–2 cm based on the visible edges of the grid deepness. Step 3: Density considerations - waffles are aerated but still reasonably dense baked goods. Standard density for waffles is moderate, less dense than bread but not as light as a sponge cake. Step 4: Portion size calibration - in Switzerland, waffles tend to be smaller than the large US portions shown at fairs. This waffle fits a typical home-cooked small to medium serving size. Step 5: Cross-validation - the waffle is comparable to a typical single serving of a light bread product. Step 6: Relative weight validation - the waffle visually dominates the plate compared to the applesauce but is a solid piece. Common home-prepared waffles average 80-110g depending on size. Given the waffle size and thickness, to avoid overestimation, it is likely around 90g. Therefore, I estimate the waffle's weight to be 90 grams."

Step 1: Locate betterave (beetroot) on the plate; it is on the left side as dark red-purple diced cubes. Step 2: There appear to be about 9-10 visible small beet cubes, roughly uniform in size. Step 3: Each cube is about 2-3 cm^3 based on comparison with the tomato slices and cucumber pieces. Step 4: Beetroot has a high density, roughly around 0.9 g/cm3. Step 5: Volume estimate is approximately 25 cm^3 (considering some hidden volume beneath by stacking). Step 6: Weight estimate = 25 cm^3 * 0.9 g/cm^3 = 22.5 g. Step 7: Considering the Swiss smaller portion context and slight uncertainty in volume, estimate range 20-30 g, final estimate a medium portion around 25 g. Therefore, the betterave portion weighs approximately 25 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The polenta is the yellow mound located on the right side of the container beneath some shredded cheese. It appears as a single portion. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Comparing the polenta to the pork piece and eggplant slices in the same container, and considering the typical dimensions of a metal lunch box visible here, the polenta mound is approximately 7 cm wide, 5 cm deep, and about 3-4 cm height under the cheese. Step 3: Density Considerations - Polenta is a cooked grain dish with moderately dense texture. Cooked polenta generally weighs about 130-150 g per 100 ml volume. Assuming the mound volume roughly as 7x5x4=140 cm3 (ml), this gives around 182-210 g without cheese. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Considering Swiss portion sizes are smaller, and some cheese volume is on top (not part of polenta weight), I reduce to about 160-180 g as a medium portion size. Step 5: Cross-validation - The amount of polenta seems comparable in volume but slightly less than the slice of pork and grilled eggplant nearby, consistent with this weight estimate. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - The polenta seems roughly equivalent or slightly heavier than the pork alone in the container, which is plausible. Therefore, a conservative and visually grounded estimate for the polenta is about 170 grams."

First, I identify the mozzarella portion on the plate, located in the top left quadrant. It appears as one whole piece, a soft ball-shaped fresh mozzarella cheese with a moist surface. Comparing its size to the olives and plate diameter (standard medium plate), the mozzarella measures approximately 7-8 cm across and about 1.5-2 cm thick. Fresh mozzarella typically has a density close to water, approximately 1 g/cm³. Estimating volume roughly as an oval or flattened sphere: approximate volume = length x width x height/2 ≈ 7 cm x 6 cm x 1.5 cm / 2 ≈ 31.5 cm³. Given density ~1 g/cm³ and moisture, the weight should be close to this volume in grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes are modest, this mozzarella ball corresponds to a typical serving size of fresh mozzarella of about 100-120 grams. Thus, I estimate the mozzarella weight to be about 110 grams, balancing visual size and typical density."

The target food is 'salade de céleri', which is located at the bottom right of the plate. Visually, this portion looks like a small mound of shredded celery root (celeriac), likely mixed with a light dressing. Comparing its volume to the other items on the plate, it occupies less space than the carrot salad and the roasted chicken but is roughly similar in volume to the potato salad portion. The shredded nature suggests some air gaps, so density is moderate, but since celeriac is fairly dense root vegetable, the weight is higher relative to volume. The portion looks like about 1 small handful (approximately 80 to 90 grams typical for such a salad in Swiss portion sizes). Given the relatively small size and thickness of the pile, a medium portion range is appropriate. Therefore, an estimate around 85 grams is reasonable."
8japfq,ratatouille,196.0,160,36.0,0.7505584512285927,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/b6659a8f-25e7-44f7-a351-7873f60f1586,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I locate the ratatouille on the plate, which is the mixed vegetable portion at the top right. The ratatouille consists mainly of cooked cubes of vegetables such as eggplant, zucchini, and tomatoes in a sauce. The pile size covers about one sixth of the plate surface with some thickness visible; it appears to be a typical side portion in a Swiss context. The plate is a standard size plate (about 25 cm wide), so this pile of ratatouille is around 10 cm by 7 cm in surface area and approximately 2-3 cm deep given the vegetable chunks and sauce density. Considering density for cooked vegetables, ratatouille is relatively dense but not as dense as meat; moisture content contributes to weight. For the volume roughly calculated (10x7x2.5 = 175 cm3), and given typical density of cooked vegetables and sauce around 0.8-1.0 g/cm3, the weight estimate is between 140-175 grams. Factoring the Swiss usual portion sizes, this looks like a medium portion, leaning toward the middle of the range. Therefore, an estimate of approximately 160 grams is suitable for the ratatouille portion visible here."

Step 1: Visual identification - the target food is 'yogourt chocolat,' which is present as the entire content in the clear glass bowl. Step 2: Dimension analysis - the bowl appears to be a small dessert bowl, roughly about 10 cm in diameter and approximately 4-5 cm deep. The chocolate yogurt fills about half to two-thirds of the bowl's depth. Comparing to the table and background objects, the volume of yogurt seems moderate, not overly filled. Step 3: Density considerations - yogurt, especially chocolate yogurt, is moderately dense with some airiness but generally close to the density of water (around 1g/cm3). Considering the volume, about 150 ml of product would weigh close to 150 grams. Step 4: Portion size calibration - visually this looks like a medium portion, not a small spoonful nor a large serving. Step 5: Cross-validation - no other foods visible, so direct weight estimate only. Step 6: Relative weight validation - not applicable. Since the yogurt fills about half to two-thirds of a small bowl (~150 ml), and assuming density ~1 g/ml, the weight is estimated around 140 grams, accounting for some airiness and uneven packing. Therefore, a reasonable estimate is 140 grams for the chocolate yogurt shown."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food item is 'salade grecque' which is visible in the plastic container. The salad contains diced cucumbers, tomatoes, yellow and green peppers, onions rings, olives, and small pieces of white cheese, consistent with a Greek salad. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The container looks like a small to medium size food storage box, roughly 15 cm by 10 cm and about 7-8 cm deep. The salad fills about half to two-thirds of the container's volume. So estimated salad volume is around (15 x 10 x 5 cm) = 750 cm3. Step 3: Density Considerations - Greek salad consists mostly of vegetables (cucumber, tomato, peppers, onion) which have high water content and moderate density, plus olives and feta cheese which increase density somewhat. An average density for such mixed salad is roughly 0.7 to 0.9 g/cm3. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given the volume and filling level, the salad portion is moderate. Using average density ~0.8 g/cm3 times approx 750 cm3 volume gives an estimated weight of ~600 grams maximum if fully filled. The container is about half full, so estimate 300-400 grams with a median around 350 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - No other foods in the image to compare but considering portion size in Swiss context (smaller portion than US), 350 grams for this salad is reasonable. Step 6: Systematic Bias Check - The salad is diced and compacted but not dense like meat; estimating too high would overestimate calories. The box is plastic container only with no weight included. The onions, olives, and cheese pieces are few and small, so total weight is dominated by diced vegetables. My final conservative estimate is 350 grams for the salade grecque shown."

The target food item is 'brochette de boeuf'. Step 1: Visual Identification - The brochette de boeuf is on a wooden skewer, located at the top center of the plate, consisting of three fairly large cubes of beef. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each beef cube looks roughly 3-4 cm in size, with a depth/height similar to width. Considering typical beef density and grilled texture, the cubes are solid and dense. Comparing to the size of the bread piece (about 6 cm long) and penne pasta (around 3-4 cm), the skewer is about 12-13 cm long. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cooked beef is dense; these three chunks would have significant weight. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Swiss portions tend to be smaller than US. A typical beef skewer serving with three sizable cubes in Switzerland might weigh between 90-130 grams. Given the visible size, it is a medium portion. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The mergez sausage below is smaller and likely weighs around 70-90 grams; the brochette appears heavier based on volume. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - The brochette de boeuf is about 1.3x the size of the mergez sausage by volume; thus a reasonable estimate is around 110 grams for the beef skewer. Final checked for over- or underestimation; the weight suits the size relative to other plate items and typical portion sizes in Switzerland."

Step 1: The target food is 'cottage cheese aux herbes.' It is located near the bottom center of the plate, visible as a white, lumpy portion with small herb pieces. Step 2: Dimension analysis shows the cottage cheese portion is about 3-4 cm in length and width, with moderate thickness, approximately 1-1.5 cm. It is a spread/soft food, not piled high. Step 3: Cottage cheese is a relatively dense dairy product with some moisture; light but denser than vegetables. Step 4: Portion size looks small to medium, fitting a dollop roughly the size of a small spoon serving. Step 5: Cross-validation: Compared to the nearby hummus portion, which looks similarly sized but slightly denser and darker, the cottage cheese quantity is smaller to medium. Step 6: Swiss context: portions tend to be smaller, so estimate a moderate size of around 60-80 grams is reasonable. Final estimate: 70 grams. This aligns with typical small serving size for cottage cheese in such a context, not overestimating. Hence, 70 grams is a balanced weight considering visual size and density."

Step 3: Pears have a typical density for fresh fruit with skin, so weight is significant but not as dense as meat. Step 4: A typical medium pear usually weighs between 150-200 grams in Swiss portion context. Step 5: Visual examination shows it's a whole pear without parts missing, no visible damage or excessive dehydration. Step 6: Cross-validate: There is only one pear visible, so no multiplication involved, and the hand provides a solid size reference.

Step 1: The target food is 'galette wraps'. Visually, it's a single whole wrap placed flat on a medium-sized dinner plate (about 25 cm in diameter by typical standards). Step 2: The wrap is thin and flat, roughly covering most of the plate, estimated diameter approximately 22-24 cm. Step 3: Typical Swiss galette wraps are thin and light but denser than a tortilla due to whole grain content. Step 4: A standard maize or wheat galette wrap measuring about 22-24 cm weighs approximately 30-40 grams. Step 5: Considering the wrap looks standard size, no visible thick layers or double wraps, and no moisture buildup that would add weight, an estimate of around 35 grams is reasonable. Step 6: Cross-validation with fillings shows moderate amount of other ingredients but does not influence wrap weight. Container and plate are not included. Thus, a conservative but accurate estimate of the galette wrap weight is 35 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is chili, located on the right side of the plate. It consists of visible chunks of cervelas sausage, kidney beans, and a tomato-based sauce. The chili portion is clearly separated from the pasta and crème fraîche. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The chili portion covers almost half of a medium-sized plate. It appears to be about 2 cm deep, considering the amount and thickness of the sauce with the sausage pieces. The visible pieces of cervelas are relatively large and spread throughout. Step 3: Density Considerations - Chili, being a cooked mixture of sausage, beans, and sauce, is dense and compact. The density is higher because of meat and beans, making it heavier than it visually appears by surface alone. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given the Swiss portion context, this chili seems like a medium portion as it fills roughly half the plate with substantial chunks. A medium portion of chili with meat and beans usually weighs between 180-250 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Compared to the pasta portion (usually around 80-100 grams), the chili looks about twice the volume and denser, reinforcing the upper medium range of weight. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - The chili portion is notably larger and denser in contrast with the crème fraîche dollop (which is small and light). Therefore, estimating chili at about 220 grams is reasonable and conservative without overestimation."
m4egh2,"salade de pâtes, cornichon, fromage, tomate",82.0,110,28.0,0.24422933730454208,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/7ff5fe61-b9cd-45c6-8df8-44a690a86b0c,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'salade de pâtes, cornichon, fromage, tomate,' which I interpret as the pasta salad containing pieces of cornichon (small pickles), cheese, and tomato. First, I locate the pasta salad on the plate: it is the mound of elbow macaroni pasta at the top right side of the plate. It contains visible small green chunks which are cornichon, and likely small pieces of cheese and tomato mixed in. Counting the visible pieces of pasta suggests a small but compact portion, about the size of a typical Swiss side salad, smaller than typical US portions. The pasta salad is about 6-7 cm wide and 3-4 cm high with a dense appearance due to the creamy sauce and mix-ins. The cornichon pieces are small but numerous within the pasta. Density is medium-high due to cooked pasta and cheese, with dressings adding slight weight. Considering typical Swiss portions for a pasta salad side, the weight would range from approximately 90 to 130 grams. Given the portion size is moderate and not piled high, I place the estimate near the middle of that range at 110 grams. No separate tomato pieces are visible except the cherry tomato on the shrimp skewer, which is excluded. Cheese is mixed in small bits, absorbed within the salad. This estimate excludes any extra sauce served separately on the plate. The estimate is coherent with the relative size compared to the shrimp and cucumber slices. Thus, 110g represents a reasonable, visually grounded estimation of the pasta salad containing cornichon, cheese, and tomato."
wrah5h,porc,52.0,80,28.0,0.1548771407297096,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/f727ac79-973e-4b92-8f2b-cda94222d4a7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I locate the target food item, 'porc' (pork), which is the piece of meat on the left side of the container under a white sauce. The pork piece appears to be a single portion, roughly 8-10 cm wide and 5-6 cm long, with about 1.5-2 cm thickness, covered by a thin white sauce layer which doesn't add weight. Comparing to the container size and the aubergine pieces (lighter, larger slices) and the polenta portion on the right, the pork piece looks moderately sized but not very thick or heavy, consistent with a small-to-medium Swiss portion. Pork is dense meat, so the volume corresponds directly to weight. Estimating volume approximately (about 8x6x1.8 cm = ~86 cm3), and knowing pork density around 1 g/cm3, the weight should be close to that volume in grams. Swiss portions typically are smaller, so I lean towards the middle range for weight. Taking this into account, the estimated weight for the pork is about 80 grams, which fits the visual evidence and portion context well. This is consistent when compared to the polenta portion, which looks larger and fluffier but lighter, and the aubergine slices, which are thin and less dense."
m4egh2,sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon),98.0,70,28.0,0.29188384214445273,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/6b91ac4b-1f0f-4176-bf40-a12a6cd892e2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, the target food item is the 'sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon)'. Visually, the sauce is creamy with visible mushroom pieces. The mushrooms are sliced and embedded in the creamy sauce, distributed mainly over the pasta portion. The serving is inside a bowl about the size of a typical small to medium soup bowl. The mushrooms appear as 7-8 medium slices, about 3-4 cm each, coated with cream. The sauce volume seems moderate, mostly filling gaps around pasta and mushrooms. Using the bowl size as a reference, the creamy sauce likely forms a layer around and beneath the pasta but is not excessively deep or abundant. Given that cream-based mushroom sauces are dense and somewhat viscous, the visible amount corresponds roughly to a small serving portion. Considering Swiss portion sizes, which tend to be moderate, the creamy sauce with mushroom pieces is estimated around 60-80 grams total weight. Mid-range for a medium portion, the estimate would be 70 grams. This accounts for both cream and mushrooms visible, without overestimating volume or thickness."

Step 1: The target food item is 'toast'. The image shows two slices of whole grain toast on a plate. Step 2: In terms of dimension, the toast slices appear to be standard size, similar to typical retail sliced bread. Each slice looks approximately 10 cm by 10 cm and about 1 cm thick. Step 3: The density of toasted bread is lighter than raw bread but similar in weight to the original slice. Each slice of sandwich bread typically weighs between 25-30 grams in Switzerland considering smaller slicing sizes. Step 4: These appear to be medium sized portions of toast (not overly large or small). The toast is dry and no additional toppings that add weight except for a thin layer of fromage frais, which is excluded as it is not the target food item. Step 5: Cross-checking relative size, toast slices appear about the size of a typical slice of bread. Step 6: Overall, given typical Swiss bread slice weights and the visual verification, a single toast slice should weigh around 28 grams. Since the request is only to estimate one slice (toast), the final estimation is 28 grams."

First, the target food item is 'yogourt figue sans sucre' which translates to sugar-free fig yogurt. The image shows a single small yogurt container with a visible layer of creamy white yogurt and fig at the bottom. The container is a typical single-serving size, similar to Swiss-style yogurts commonly found in grocery stores. Considering the size relative to the fork nearby and the thickness of the yogurt layer visible, the volume is approximately 125 grams, a common portion size for yogurt cups in Switzerland. There is no lid or container weight included, only the yogurt itself. The yogurt appears creamy and dense but not excessively heavy. The fig pieces seem integrated in small amount at the bottom layer, contributing to the total weight without significant volume. Hence, based on this typical portion size and visual confirmation, the estimated weight is 125 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food item is 'cereales' (cereals). The cereals are visible floating in milk in a medium-sized bowl. The individual cereal clusters are relatively large and chunky, with some chunks of chocolate. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The bowl appears to be a standard cereal bowl with a diameter of about 15-18 cm. The milk volume occupies about half the bowl depth. The cereals cover roughly half of the visible milk surface area and appear to penetrate somewhat into the milk but not fully submerged. The cereal clusters vary in size but most are about 2-3 cm in diameter, and there appear to be roughly 15-20 clusters visible. Since the cereals are partly submerged, a depth of around 1 to 1.5 cm of cereal is a reasonable estimate. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cereals, especially granola type with chunks and chocolate, are moderately dense but porous. Typical density about 0.35 to 0.45 g/cm3 is a good reference. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given Swiss portion sizes, this looks like a middle-size portion, not overly full. Step 5: Cross-validation - The milk volume seems typical for a bowl of cereals; cereal volume is smaller but due to density still significant. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - Milk weight could be around 150-200g; cereals appear roughly a quarter to a third of the milk volume. Calculation: Approximate surface cereal area ~ half of bowl surface ~ 80 cm2 (assuming 16 cm diameter bowl, area = pi*r^2 = 3.14 * (8)^2 = ~200 cm2, half is ~100 cm2, but cereals are patchy so ~80 cm2 actual). With estimated cereal depth 1.5 cm, volume = 80 * 1.5 = 120 cm3. Using density 0.4 g/cm3, weight = 120 * 0.4 = 48 g. Considering possible variation and the fact that some cereal is submerged, I adjust slightly downward. Final estimate: 40 g of cereals."

Step 1: Visual identification - The target food item is crème caramel, which is the creamy custard-like dessert in the bowl. It appears to be somewhat spread out in the bowl but still forming a thick mass without much liquid pooling. Step 2: Dimension analysis - The bowl is handheld and visible against a person's thigh for scale. The bowl diameter is roughly 12-14 cm, and the crème caramel portion fills roughly the center 6-7 cm of the bowl with a thickness (depth) of about 1.5-2 cm given the slight mound shape. Step 3: Density considerations - Crème caramel is a soft custard, dense but also contains some liquid content. Estimated density is close to 1 g/cm³, so the volume roughly translates to weight in grams. Step 4: Portion size - The quantity looks like a small to medium dessert serving, not a large portion. Step 5: Cross-validation - Compared to the hand size and thigh, the portion looks moderate, consistent with a small single serving typical in Swiss context. Step 6: Relative weight validation - No other foods visible for direct comparison, but the size against the hand suggests around 100-130g. Calculation estimate: approximately 6.5 cm diameter x 6.5 cm diameter x 1.7 cm depth = ~72 cm³ volume; multiplied by density ~1 g/cm³, estimate 70-80g. Taking into account slight mound shape and some additional volume, final estimate is around 90g as a medium portion. Thus, the estimated weight for the crème caramel is 90 grams."

Step 1: Visual identification shows one peeled carrot placed on a counter. It is whole and not cut. Step 2: Dimension analysis - comparing the carrot to the visible granite countertop texture and typical carrot sizes, this carrot is medium in length (approximately 15-18 cm) and thickness. Step 3: Density considerations - carrots are dense root vegetables; a medium peeled carrot typically weighs more than 50g. Step 4: Portion size calibration - this looks like a standard medium-sized peeled carrot typical in Swiss portions, neither unusually thick nor thin. Step 5: Cross-validation - no other food items are present to compare but the carrot appears whole and intact. Step 6: Relative weight validation - n/a here since only one item. Conclusion: A medium peeled carrot of this size typically weighs between 60 to 80 grams. Given this carrot looks moderately thick and typical in length and the visual evidence, 70 grams is a reasonable estimate."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is 'oeuf' (egg), visible as scrambled egg pieces on the bottom left of the plate. It appears as one serving portion, scrambled and spread modestly on the plate. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The scrambled egg portion is roughly 7 cm by 4 cm in area, with a thickness of about 1-1.5 cm judging by typical scrambling density and visible volume. Compared to the plate size (~20 cm square), the egg portion is relatively small but dense. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cooked scrambled eggs are moderately dense; the texture is fluffy but still compact. The portion appears typical for one medium egg. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - A small-to-medium Swiss portion of scrambled egg is typically around 50-70g; this looks closer to the smaller side given the modest amount on the plate. Step 5: Cross-validation - Relative to the tomato and avocado portions, which appear similar in volume but lighter in density, the egg portion is denser and about the same volume as each of those, supporting the ~60g estimate. Step 6: Relative weight validation - The other items (tomato, avocado) are less dense but visually similar in size. The egg portion does not seem overly large or small. Conclusion: The scrambled egg portion likely weighs approximately 60 grams."

The target food item is ""fromage de brebis/chèvre (2 bouts)"" which are the two small cheese pieces located near the bottom left of the plate, directly beneath the slice of baguette and next to other cheeses. Step 1: Visual Identification - Counted exactly 2 distinct pieces of fromage de brebis/chèvre. They appear firm and semi-soft cheeses, shaped as small irregular chunks, typical for this type of cheese portioning. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each piece is roughly roughly 2-3 cm in length, 1.5-2 cm in width, and approximately 1.5 cm in thickness. Comparing to the bread slice and standard fork size, these pieces look reasonably small, with a combined volume slightly smaller than a golf ball. Step 3: Density Considerations - Sheep/goat cheese typically have a density around 0.9 to 1.1 g/cm³ due to moderate moisture and fat content. They are denser than very soft cheeses but less dense than hard cheeses. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Each piece appears to be about 15-20 grams individually. Together, that would constitute a medium portion between 30-40 grams total. Step 5: Cross Validation - Compared to other cheeses on the plate, the two pieces combined are smaller in volume than the larger slices of tomme or brie, consistent with a 30-40g estimate. Step 6: Final Adjustment - Favoring conservative estimation due to partial natural crumbles and moderate porosity, the final estimate is 35 grams for both pieces combined, excluding rind and container weight."
6fwmw2,perle de blé,138.0,120,18.0,0.2642272098712903,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/6fwmw2/dish_media/1da85bf5-675f-472d-8594-733069301dd5,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I locate the target food 'perle de blé' in the image. The perle de blé are the small, round, pearl-like grains present mixed with the yellow-colored sauce and shrimp. The quantity appears to cover about half of the bowl's base area, beneath and around the shrimp and sauce. The bowl is medium-sized, likely around 15 cm in diameter. The depth of the perle de blé portion is partially visible but likely around 2-3 cm given the layering under the shrimp and sauce. Perle de blé is dense and compact when cooked, similar to large couscous or wheat pearls. Estimating the volume: if the perle de blé covers half the bowl's base (approx. 80 cm^2) and assuming 2 cm depth, that results in roughly 160 cm^3 volume. Cooked pearl wheat density is about 0.8 g/cm^3. Multiplying gives 160 * 0.8 = 128 g. Considering this is a Swiss portion and the layer might be thinner or mixed with sauce, I adjust the estimate conservatively to a medium portion of approximately 120 g. Cross-checking size visually against the green beans (haticot coco) and shrimp, the perle de blé mass appears appropriate in relation and does not seem overestimated. Therefore, the estimated weight of perle de blé in the bowl is 120 grams."

Step 1: The target food item is a single cookie with visible large chocolate chunks. It is placed on a wooden table, which serves as a neutral background without any precise size reference such as a hand or utensil. Step 2: Based on the size of the wood grain and typical cookie dimensions, this cookie appears to be roughly 7-8 cm in diameter, which is a common size for homemade or bakery cookies. The thickness appears moderate, approximately 1.5-2 cm, given the slightly raised surface and visible texture. Step 3: Considering the density, cookies with chocolate chunks are moderately dense, denser than airy cookies but less dense than solid cakes. The chocolate chunks add weight, while the cookie dough itself is relatively light but compact. Step 4: For Swiss portion sizes, a cookie of this size generally ranges between 30-50 grams. Given the visible thickness and chocolate amount, this cookie is medium-sized. Step 5: Cross-validation with typical cookie weights confirms that plain chocolate chunk cookies of similar size average around 40 grams. Step 6: There are no other foods in the image to compare relative weights, but the cookie's size and thickness align with a mid-range portion. Final estimation, considering all factors, is 40 grams, reflecting a medium-sized chocolate chunk cookie in a Swiss portion context."

The target food is 'caviar d'aubergine,' which is the spread on the slice of bread at the top center of the plate. Step 1: Visual Identification - There is one slice of bread with the caviar d'aubergine spread on top, covering the surface but not very thick. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The bread slice is approximately 12 cm long and 7 cm wide, typical for a slice of pain aux graines. The thickness of the eggplant spread appears to be thin, roughly 3-4 mm. Step 3: Density Considerations - Caviar d'aubergine is a puréed cooked vegetable spread, relatively dense but lighter than cheese or meats. The spread is visibly moist but not heavy. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Comparing to typical Swiss portion sizes for spreads on one slice of bread, a thin to medium layer like this usually weighs between 20-35g. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The tapenade olive noire on the other bread slice looks denser and heavier, so this spread should be lighter than that one. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - The caviar d'aubergine is spread thinly; given it's the only portion on the bread slice, it should be around 25g. Considering all the clues and the visual evidence, 25 grams is a conservative and accurate estimate for the eggplant spread without including the bread weight."

The target food item is 'tomates'. Step 1: Visual Identification - There are multiple pieces of chopped tomato on the plate, cut into roughly bite-sized chunks, approximately 9 visible pieces. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The tomato pieces appear to be typical medium-sized chunks from one small to medium tomato, each around 3-4 cm in length and 1.5-2 cm thickness. Step 3: Density Considerations - Tomatoes are relatively dense but have a lot of water content, density is moderate. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The pieces are spread over a small salad portion on an average side plate (about 20 cm diameter). The total visible tomato volume corresponds roughly to about half a medium tomato. A medium tomato typically weighs about 120-150 grams, so half would be 60-75 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The tomatoes and cucumbers appear roughly equal in volume, maybe tomatoes slightly more. This supports the portion estimate. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - Compared to cucumbers, tomatoes are slightly denser, so weight might be slightly higher despite similar volume. Given these observations and Swiss portion context (favoring smaller portions), a reasonable medium estimate for the tomatoes on this plate is around 65 grams. No container weight is included and the pieces are clearly visible, so no depth or hidden volume adjustment needed. This estimate is conservative and aligns with visual evidence and typical tomato weights."

Step 1: The target food is industrial apricot yogurt with pieces, presented in a white bowl. The yogurt looks smooth and slightly thick with visible small apricot chunks. Step 2: The bowl size and the laptop keyboard in the background provide reference for scale. The bowl seems a standard small serving bowl, roughly 12-14 cm diameter. The yogurt fills around half the bowl in volume. Step 3: Yogurt density is close to water, around 1 g/cm3, so weight in grams is roughly equal to volume in ml. Step 4: Estimated volume of yogurt in the bowl is about 150 ml, based on filling half of a small bowl. Step 5: Considering possible slight overestimation due to bowl depth and the presence of apricot pieces which add a small amount of extra weight, the total weight range would be between 140-170 grams. Step 6: As a medium portion, we pick the midpoint around 155 grams. Therefore, the estimated weight of the apricot yogurt with pieces is approximately 155 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food item is 'pain' (bread). The image shows one slice of brown bread with Nutella spread on top, occupying roughly half of a standard small dessert plate. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Comparing the bread slice to the strawberries and raspberries, the bread is about 12-14 cm long and 8-10 cm wide, about the size of a typical slice of Swiss artisan bread. The thickness of the bread slice is around 1.5 cm based on the visible crust edge. Step 3: Density Considerations - Bread is generally lighter than dense food but weighs more than fruit per volume. Artisanal whole grain breads are moderately dense. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - A typical slice of Swiss whole grain or similar bread weighs between 30-40g for a slice of this thickness and size, slightly smaller than US large slices. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Compared to the sizeable strawberries (each about 15-20g) and the raspberries (about 4-5 grams each), the bread weight is reasonable within this range. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - The bread bulk is larger in volume but less dense than Nutella or densely packed toppings, and definitely heavier than the small fruit pieces individually. Considering the crust and porous crumb, the weighed estimate is solid. Final estimate: A medium slice of artisan bread of this size typically weighs about 35 grams. This accounts for Swiss portion size and avoids overestimation from thickness or visual surface area alone."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is 'poivrons jaune' (yellow peppers). In the image, I see one whole yellow pepper stuffed and standing upright, and two separate slices of roasted yellow pepper on the plate. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The whole pepper is medium-sized, roughly 7-8 cm high and about 6-7 cm in diameter. The two slices appear to be from the same pepper, each about 5-6 cm wide and curved. The thickness of yellow pepper flesh, roasted, is roughly 0.5-1.0 cm. The pepper flesh is relatively dense for vegetables but lighter than dense meat or cheese. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cooked pepper loses some water and shrinks slightly but retains density. Raw weight estimates apply, but cooked might be about 85-90% of raw. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Considering the whole pepper and two slices visible, it looks like nearly one whole medium yellow pepper. A medium yellow pepper typically weighs about 120-150g raw. After roasting, it might weigh slightly less, but the difference is small. Step 5: Cross Validation - The stuffed pepper contains quinoa and bulgur, so the filling is not part of the pepper weight. The pepper skin and flesh alone is estimated; container weight is excluded per instructions. The two slices plus the intact portion combine to about one medium pepper in total volume. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - Comparing the pepper size to the plate and fork nearby indicates a realistic medium pepper size. Overestimation is avoided by excluding filling weight. Conservative estimate is about 135g for the pepper flesh visible. Final: Poivrons jaune (yellow pepper) weight estimated as 135g."

The target food is 'mais' (corn). Visually, the corn portion is located near the bottom center of the plate, clearly separated from the salad, broccoli, and chickpeas. The corn appears as kernels roughly covering a small area on the plate, likely from a small can or fresh corn cut off the cob. Comparing the corn to the broccoli florets and chickpeas, the corn portion looks smaller than the chickpeas but slightly smaller or about half the mass of the broccoli. The plate is a typical small Swiss dinner plate (~22 cm diameter), and the corn pile is low in height, mostly a single layer of kernels, suggesting a shallow portion with some volume but no significant height. Corn kernels are dense but not heavy individually. I estimate the corn portion to weigh moderately for such a portion – a typical medium side serving of corn is about 80-100 grams, but here the portion is moderate to small in Swiss portion standards. Considering this, an internal weight range could be 70-90 grams, with a medium-small portion leaning toward 75 grams being reasonable. Therefore, I estimate 75 grams for the corn portion."

Step 2: Dimension analysis shows the scoop is about the size of a standard single ice cream scoop, roughly spherical with a diameter of about 5-6 cm, considering the size relative to the bowl and the chocolate sauce pool. Step 3: Density considerations for ice cream indicate it is less dense than water but relatively compact. A typical single scoop of ice cream weighs approximately 60-80 grams in Swiss portion standards, which tend to be smaller than US portions. Step 4: Portion size calibration suggests this scoop is a medium portion (not very large or small). Step 5: Cross-validation with the other food items in the bowl confirms the scoop size is reasonable; the chocolate sauce adds no weight to the ice cream itself, and the compote is separate and not counted. Step 6: Relative weight validation matches the typical weight for one scoop. Therefore, a careful estimate of the vanilla ice cream scoop weight, based solely on visual evidence, is 70 grams."

Step 1: Visual identification - The target food is 'pain' (bread). There are two slices of bread on a plate covered partially with butter and spreads, but we focus only on the bread component. Step 2: Dimension analysis - Each slice appears to be roughly medium size typical of Swiss bread slices, approximately 10 cm long, 7 cm wide, and about 1.5-2 cm thick including the crust. Step 3: Density considerations - Bread density is relatively light, averaging around 250-300 grams per 1000 cubic cm. Step 4: Portion size calibration - One slice of medium-sized bread slice typically weighs around 30-40 grams. Here, since both slices are visually similar and typical size, each slice likely falls in this range. Step 5: Cross-validation - Since the food item is 'pain' without specifying one or two slices, by default the estimation is per slice, which aligns with the query's focus per single piece. Step 6: Final estimation - Considering the size and average bread density, a single slice of bread here weighs approximately 35 grams, accounting for any slight variation due to crust and density. No container weight included, only bread. Hence, the recommended estimate for 'pain' (one bread slice) is 35 grams."

Step 1: The target food is 'chocolat noir,' and we see one broken piece of dark chocolate on a flat surface. Step 2: The chocolate piece has a typical thickness of about 0.7-1 cm and a length roughly equivalent to a typical square from a standard chocolate bar, approximately 3-4 cm long and 2-3 cm wide. Step 3: Dark chocolate is fairly dense. A typical square from a standard Swiss dark chocolate bar weighs between 8 and 12 grams. This piece is not a full square but appears to be roughly half a square in volume due to its broken edge and irregular shape. Step 4: Assuming one full chocolate square is about 10 grams, half the square would be approximately 5 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation with the visible size and density confirms this is a small piece, likely a half or two-thirds of a whole square. Step 6: Given these observations, a conservative estimate places this piece at about 5 grams, allowing for slight variations in thickness and breakage. Therefore, the estimated weight is 5 grams."

The target food is ""vinaigre"", which is a liquid dressing visible as a light, slightly yellowish sheen mainly on the cucumber and tomato pieces and some scattered on the carrot and seeds. Step 1: Visual Identification - The vinaigre is not a separate visible pool but appears as a thin layer of dressing over the salad components. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Given the size of the bowl (standard small salad bowl) and the visible surface coverage, the vinaigre would be a light coating, likely not more than a teaspoon or so in volume. Step 3: Density Considerations - Vinegar has a density close to water, about 1g/ml. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The amount of visible vinegar is very small, typical dressing pour for a single salad portion in Switzerland would be between 5 to 15 ml. Step 5: Cross-validation - Relative to the solid ingredients, vinaigre quantity is minimal, likely under 10 grams. Step 6: Considering possible errors and the fact that not all vinegar may be visible due to absorption, a middle estimate of 8 grams is reasonable and conservative."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food item is a peeled banana, appearing as a single piece lying on a dark surface. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The banana fragment appears to be roughly half the size of a regular banana, considering typical banana length of about 15-18 cm is common in Swiss portions; this portion measures roughly around 7-8 cm in length. Width and thickness seem consistent with average banana girth (approximately 3-3.5 cm in diameter). Step 3: Density Considerations - Bananas have moderate density, roughly 0.9 g/cm3. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - A whole medium banana usually weighs around 120-150g. Since this is about half a banana, the weight estimate should be roughly 55-75g, leaning towards smaller side given Swiss portion. Step 5: Cross-validation - No other food items for comparison, but the banana appears consistent with average small to medium banana slice. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - Not applicable here. Final estimate: approximately 65g, balancing typical banana weight and visible portion size."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food item is one single round slice (rondelle) of lemon floating on top of a glass of water. There is only one piece. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The lemon slice appears to be a typical citrus slice with a diameter about the size of a standard drinking glass rim (~7 cm). The slice looks thin, about 0.3 to 0.4 cm thick. Step 3: Density Considerations - Lemons are relatively dense fruit; they contain water and pulp but are lighter than dense foods like cheese or meat. The skin adds some weight but the overall slice is quite thin. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - A typical lemon weighs around 100-120 g, with about 10-12 slices per lemon. That implies about 8-12 g per slice if thick, but thinner slices like this are usually lighter, closer to 5-7 g. Given this slice is thin and appears standard size in Swiss context (which tends to be more moderate), I estimate this slice weighs around 6 g. Step 5 & 6: Cross-validation and relative weight - This is a single slice of lemon, so no stacking or additional pieces to consider. The weighted estimate aligns logically with the visible size and known lemon slice weights. Therefore, a weight of approximately 6 grams is reasonable and conservative from visual evidence."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food item is 'sauce oignons,' which is clearly visible as a layer of cooked onions with sauce atop the slices of roast meat (rôti) on the left side of the plate. The sauce mostly covers the two visible slices of meat. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The visible area of the sauce oignons corresponds closely to the surface of the two meat slices, roughly 10 cm by 6 cm coverage, with the thin layer of onions sitting on top. The depth of the onion sauce is thin to moderate, roughly 0.5 to 1 cm in thickness. Because it is a sauce with cooked onions, volume is modest. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cooked onions in sauce have moderate density, more fluid than solid but not very light. Onions shrink when cooked, so the real weight is primarily from the onions plus liquid. The visible quantity aligns with a small serving of sauce rather than a large puddle. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - For Swiss portions, this is a small to medium amount of sauce onions covering roast meat on a plate. Estimate range is approximately 30 to 50 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Compared to the amount of roast meat (estimated around 120-150g), the sauce onions portion is significantly less, approximately 1/3 the meat weight, consistent with a sauce portion typically served. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - The sauce oignons volume and area corresponds to a reasonable sauce portion without excess spillage beyond the meat. The small puddle of sauce around the meat further supports this amount. Final estimation: 40 grams of sauce oignons, balancing the visible onion quantity, sauce thickness, and Swiss portion sizes."

The target food item is ""sauce"". From the image, the sauce is a brown gravy covering the plate underneath and around the meat, carrots, and mashed potatoes (purée de pdt). The plate is a standard size, approximately 25 cm in diameter based on the visible cutlery and placemat. The sauce spreads thinly with some pooling around the foods, indicating it is relatively liquid and not overly thick. Assessing the surface area, the sauce covers about half to two-thirds of the plate's bottom surface, but with a thin visible depth—likely 2-3 mm thick where the sauce pools more heavily and less elsewhere. Accounting for the plate's curved edges and the sauce being beneath and around solid foods, the normal depth is shallow but consistent. The sauce volume roughly resembles a thin layer across about 350 cm² with an average depth of 2 mm (0.2 cm), giving approximately 70 cm³ (350 x 0.2). Sauce/gravy density approximates water to slightly denser at about 1.03 g/cm³. Multiplying volume by density, the sauce weighs roughly 70-75 grams. Considering some sauce is absorbed by the mashed potatoes and less around other parts, a reasonable range is 60-80 grams. By Swiss portion standards, this appears a medium portion of sauce, thus around 70 grams is an appropriate final estimate."

The target food is ""purée cacahuète"" (peanut butter). Step 1: Visual Identification - The peanut butter is a single dollop on the left side of the black plate. It is smooth and thick, not spread very thin. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Compared to the plate diameter (approx. 22-24 cm standard plate), the peanut butter portion looks to be about 5 cm long and 3 cm wide, with a thickness estimate around 0.8 cm. Step 3: Density Considerations - Peanut butter is dense and sticky, so it weighs more for its volume compared to less dense foods. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Visually, this looks like a small to medium dollop, likely around 1 tablespoon (15g) to 1.5 tablespoons (22g) size. Step 5: Cross Validation - Considering typical Swiss portion sizes and comparing to other items on the plate (banana half and oats), the portion seems closer to a small-medium amount. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - Peanut butter weighs approx. 16 g per tablespoon; given the visible portion and thickness, the weight is estimated at about 20 grams, a reasonable mid-range estimate given the visual size and density without overestimation. Therefore, the best estimate for the peanut butter portion, based purely on visual evidence and logical deduction, is 20 grams."

STEP 1: VISUAL IDENTIFICATION - The target food item is 'yogourt orange sanguine'. In the image, the bowl contains a mixture of yogurt, cereals, and blueberries. The yogurt is visibly well mixed in and is creamy and colored slightly pinkish/orange due to the blood orange flavor. It appears as the bulk liquid matrix binding the cereal and blueberries together. STEP 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS - The bowl is a medium-sized cereal bowl roughly 15 cm in diameter. The yogurt mixture fills most of the bowl to an estimated depth of about 3-4 cm. Given that the mixture contains cereal and blueberries, only a portion of the volume is yogurt. Visually, the solid mix occupies nearly full volume, but yogurt is the liquid/media binding them. STEP 3: DENSITY CONSIDERATIONS - Yogurt density is about 1 g/ml. The overall mixture density may be slightly reduced by cereal lightness, but yogurt itself is dense. STEP 4: PORTION SIZE CALIBRATION - Typical Swiss cereal bowl servings of yogurt are smaller than in the US, about 150-200 g. Given that the cereal and blueberries share the volume, the amount of yogurt alone is less. From the visual, roughly 50-60% of the mixture volume is yogurt. The bowl appears to hold about 300 ml total mixture, so yogurt volume would be around 150-180 ml (grams). STEP 5: CROSS-VALIDATION - The yogurt is consistent with a medium portion; not overly full bowl, not small. STEP 6: RELATIVE WEIGHT VALIDATION - Relative to the cereal and blueberries, yogurt is almost equal or slightly more by weight. Therefore, an estimate around 160 grams is appropriate. Final estimate: Yogurt orange sanguine weight is approximately 160 grams."

Step 1: Visual identification - The target food is 'mayonnaise thomy,' located as a dollop on the upper left side of the plate alongside white asparagus. It is a single portion of mayonnaise, not mixed or layered. Step 2: Dimension analysis - The mayonnaise portion is roughly 3-4 cm in diameter and about 2-3 cm high, based on comparison to the asparagus stalks which are about 1.5 to 2 cm in diameter. The depth/height suggests a small mound, roughly akin to a rounded teaspoon portion. Step 3: Density considerations - Mayonnaise is a dense, creamy condiment, typically with a density close to 0.9-1 g/ml. This small dollop is visually compact. Step 4: Portion size calibration - The visible amount corresponds to a small to medium dollop around 10-15 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - Compared to the asparagus pieces (medium portion), the mayonnaise appears substantially smaller in volume and weight. Typical single serving mayonnaise servings in Switzerland tend to be around 10-15 grams. Step 6: Relative weight validation - This portion is roughly 1/6 or less of the asparagus total weight, consistent with a 10-15 grams mayonnaise estimation. Conclusion: Based on visual size, density, and typical portion sizes, the mayonnaise portion weighs about 12 grams."

The target food item is ""pâtes"" (pasta). Step 1: Visual Identification - The pasta is visible under the mushroom sauce, forming a moderate pile in the center of the plate. The pasta appears to be tagliatelle or fettuccine type, cooked and somewhat spread out but with some depth. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The plate diameter is a standard dinner plate (~25 cm). The pasta occupies roughly 1/3 of the plate surface area with some overlapping layers and visible folds, suggesting an approximate volume similar to a small to medium portion. Depth is moderate, roughly 1.5 to 2 cm visible, accounting for layers beneath. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cooked pasta is dense and compact, so weight corresponds closely to its volume. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Swiss portion sizes tend to be smaller than US. Given the visible amount, this corresponds to a medium portion of pasta. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The pasta is less volumetric than the gratinée courgettes but is denser. Relative to the mushrooms on top, the pasta is the main bulk. Step 6: Systematic Bias Check - The portion does not look excessively large; no overestimation. Considering the above, a medium Swiss portion of cooked pasta is about 120-140 grams. Estimating on the middle to slightly lower side due to moderate quantity visible, I estimate approximately 130 grams. No container weight is included, only the pasta itself."

The target food is 'fromage' (cheese). Step 1: Visual Identification - The cheese is cut into thin rectangular slices placed on one half of the sandwich. There are about 6 slices visible, overlapping slightly, covering most of the bread slice. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The slices appear to be about 1 cm wide, 6-7 cm long, and approximately 1-2 mm thick. Given the typical Swiss bread slice size (roughly 12 cm x 7 cm), the cheese covers around 70% of the slice. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cheese is dense, so weight is relatively high for its volume. Typical semi-hard cheese density is around 1.1 g/cm3. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - A thin cheese slice of about 1mm thickness on a slice of bread usually weighs about 10-15 grams. With 6 slices, and slight overlapping reducing total thickness, a medium portion is about 30-35 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Compared to the bread slice, cheese volume is moderate but not excessive. Step 6: Systematic Bias Check - Cheese is not piled thickly, so no need to increase heavily. Overall, a conservative estimate is 30 grams for the cheese slices shown."

The yogurt container appears typical of single-serving yogurt pots commonly around 125g in Switzerland. Step 3: Density Considerations - Yogurt density is close to water (~1 g/cm3), so the volume roughly equals the weight in grams. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - This portion looks like a standard single-serve yogurt pot, not unusually large or small, so estimate is around the common size of 125g. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Compared to the apple, the yogurt volume is consistent with common serving sizes. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - Standard yogurt pots in Switzerland are typically 125g. Visual evidence matches this typical portion. No signs of extra or depleted volume. Conclusion: The yogurt is estimated at 125 grams based on visual cues and standard portion sizes."

First, I identify the mayonnaise on the plate as the creamy white dollop on the left side. The portion is a single, distinct swirl approximately the size of a large spoonful. Comparing the mayonnaise to the standard fork in the image, the volume seems to be about 2-3 tablespoons. Considering that mayonnaise is dense and thick, 1 tablespoon typically weighs around 14 grams. Estimating 2.5 tablespoons, this portion would weigh around 35 grams. The portion is relatively modest in a Swiss context, not overly large, so 35 grams is a reasonable estimate. Container weight is excluded, and the portion is fully visible. Cross-checking with other items on the plate, mayonnaise volume and density align well without overestimation. Hence, the best estimation for the mayonnaise weight seen here is 35 grams."

Step 1: Visual identification: The target food is 'yogourt nature', which is spread on a single slice of 'pain complet' (whole grain bread). The yogurt covers most of the slice with a layer that looks evenly spread, but not too thick. Step 2: Dimension analysis: The bread slice is about 10 cm long and 6-7 cm wide. The yogurt layer appears to be about 3-5 mm thick on average, typical for a single-spread serving on bread. Step 3: Density considerations: Natural yogurt has a density close to water (~1 g/cm³). Step 4: Portion size calibration: The spread looks like a moderate portion, covering the whole bread slice but not excessively thick—it is not a very shallow smear, nor a thick dollop. Step 5: Cross-validation: Comparing to the anchovies portion, the yogurt layer appears visually larger in volume, consistent with a small but typical yogurt portion on toast. Step 6: Calculation: Volume estimation = length (10 cm) × width (7 cm) × thickness (0.4 cm average) = 28 cm³ approx. Since density ~1 g/cm³, weight ~28 g. Given the spread variability and typical portion sizes, an estimate of 25-30 grams fits. Choosing median 28 g is reasonable. Thus, the estimated weight of the 'yogourt nature' spread on this slice of bread is about 28 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food item is 'cacahuètes' (peanuts). They are inside a relatively small glass bottle, filling roughly one third of its height. Peanuts are visible as whole kernels, shelled and dry. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The bottle size seems to be a small glass container, comparable to a small spice jar or a small milk bottle, about 10-12 cm tall. The peanuts fill the bottom third, which is approximately 3-4 cm in height. The bottle diameter is roughly 5 cm. The volume occupied by peanuts is roughly the cylinder volume: π * (2.5 cm)^2 * 3.5 cm ≈ 68.7 cm³. Step 3: Density Considerations - Peanuts are dense; typical density (shelled peanut kernels) is about 0.6-0.7 g/cm³, taking into account some air gaps between them. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Using 0.65 g/cm³ density as a midpoint, estimated weight = 68.7 cm³ * 0.65 g/cm³ = ~44.7g. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Volume seems reasonable for peanuts in such a container; 44-45 g is a typical small snack portion. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - No other food items visible for comparison. Container weight excluded per instructions. Final estimated weight for peanuts inside the bottle is approximately 45 g."

The target food item is 'sauce curry avec mayonnaise.' Step 1: Visual Identification - The saucing is visible as a yellow spread visible inside the baguette sandwiches, appearing as a thin but noticeable layer beneath the chicken and lettuce. It is not heavily layered or piled; it’s a spread. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The spread appears thinly applied, roughly covering the inner bread surface of two approximately 15 cm sandwich halves each. The visible area of the spread is about 2 sandwiches of 15-16 cm, each sandwich likely having about 2-3 mm thickness of sauce on each side. Considering spread depth and coverage, the total volume looks small, roughly 20-25 ml in total. Step 3: Density Considerations - Curry sauce with mayonnaise tends to have density close to mayonnaise, roughly 0.9-1 g/ml, so the weight in grams is nearly the volume in ml. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given the thin spread on two medium sandwiches, this is a small to medium amount of sauce applied. Weight range can vary 20-40 grams but this looks closer to the lower-middle due to thin application. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Compared visually to chicken pieces (each likely 80-100 g) and lettuce (~10-15 g per sandwich), sauce portion is significantly smaller, about 1/4 or less of chicken weight, which aligns with the 20-30 g estimation. Step 6: Bias Check - Since the sauce is spread thin, avoid overestimating as thick layering is absent; no visible pooling or layered sauce is seen. Overall, a conservative estimate near 25 grams is reasonable for the amount of curry-mayonnaise sauce present in the two sandwiches combined."

Step 1: The target food item is a single cookie visible clearly on a textured granite surface. There is only one piece to count. Step 2: Dimension analysis - the cookie appears roughly 7-8 cm in diameter based on typical chocolate chip cookie size relative to the visible granite pattern, which gives a rough size reference. Thickness looks about 1-1.5 cm, which is typical for a homemade or bakery-style cookie. Step 3: Density considerations - cookies are moderately dense, baked goods with a crumbly texture and some embedded chocolate chunks, which add some weight but not heavily dense. Step 4: Portion size calibration - Swiss portions of cookies tend to be slightly smaller than US, but this size is moderate. Typical weight for such a cookie is usually between 30-50 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - this cookie visually corresponds to a medium-large cookie piece. Step 6: Relative weight validation - no other foods to compare to, but the cookie has a standard size resembling typical store-bought cookies. Considering all, a medium portion weight of around 40 grams is a reasonable and conservative estimate for this cookie. This avoids overestimating based solely on size and accounts for some variation in thickness and chocolate chunk inclusion."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The muesli is the layer mostly covering the yogurt inside the metal bowl. It appears as flakes, grains, and small clusters uniformly distributed on top. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The metal bowl is a typical small-sized breakfast bowl, approximately 12-14 cm in diameter judging by the visible countertop texture and size in relation. The muesli layer covers the top, with some depth visible through the sides of the bowl. Estimating the muesli layer thickness as roughly 1 to 1.5 cm deep over the surface, with some depth hidden below the yogurt lumps. Step 3: Density Considerations - Muesli is a mixture of oats, nuts, and dried fruits with moderate density, approximately 0.4 to 0.6 grams per cm3. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - With about 12 cm diameter, area is roughly π*(6 cm)^2 ≈ 113 cm2. Volume estimate = area * depth ≈ 113 * 1.2 cm = 135.6 cm3. Using density midpoint of 0.5 g/cm3, estimated weight = 135.6 * 0.5 = 67.8 g. Step 5 and 6: Considering partial mixing with yogurt, muesli is somewhat compressed. The portion looks medium size for Swiss portions. Some muesli is embedded with yogurt, so weight slightly less than calculated. Adjusting conservatively down by 10-15%. So final estimate ~60 g. This fits reasonable typical Swiss muesli serving portion sizes. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'muesli nature' in the bowl is 60 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification. The target food item is 'avocat' (avocado). There is one visible slice of avocado on the plate, approximately one-sixth to one-fifth of a whole avocado fruit. Step 2: Dimension Analysis. The avocado slice is roughly 7-8 cm long, 3-4 cm wide, and looks moderately thick with curved depth typical of a single avocado segment. The slice is resting alone without visible pit or skin on the cut side, suggesting mostly edible flesh. Step 3: Density Considerations. Avocado is a dense, creamy fruit with an average density approximately 0.96 g/cm3. A typical whole avocado weighs about 150-200 grams. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration. Given that this avocado piece is about one-sixth to one-fifth of the whole avocado, the weight should be around 30-40 grams. There is no evidence suggesting this is an unusually large or small slice. Step 5: Cross-validation with other items. The avocado slice volume appears smaller than the carrot pile and much smaller than two skewers of chicken and pieces of lard. Thus, the estimation seems logical relative to the other items. Step 6: Bias check. The piece is a single, solid slice, so no underestimation due to spread or hidden volume. The density estimate accounts for creamy flesh. Therefore, a conservative, well-rounded estimate is 35 grams for this avocado slice."

STEP 1: VISUAL IDENTIFICATION - The target food ""noix de cajou"" (cashew nuts) are clearly visible in the person's open hand. They are loose, whole cashews, not chopped or mixed with other foods. Counting them, there are about 18 individual cashew nuts visible. STEP 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS - Compared to the hand size, each cashew nut is roughly 2-3 cm in length with a typical thickness for a cashew nut. The depth is moderate, as they are solid nuts. The hand size is an average adult female size, so the visual scale is realistic. STEP 3: DENSITY CONSIDERATIONS - Cashew nuts are dense and relatively heavy compared to their size due to fat content. Average weight of one whole cashew is about 1.4 grams. STEP 4: PORTION SIZE CALIBRATION - 18 nuts × 1.4 grams = 25.2 grams. Since the quantity looks like a handful, which is often around 20-30 grams in Swiss portion context, this fits within a medium portion range. STEP 5: CROSS-VALIDATION - No other foods in hand to compare, but the estimate aligns with standard portion sizes for nuts which are dense and small. STEP 6: RELATIVE WEIGHT VALIDATION - N/A as only one food type visible. SYSTEMATIC BIAS CHECK - No overestimation since counting was meticulous, no container weight is included, density is accounted for, and size scale based on hand is reasonable. Final estimate: approximately 25 grams for the cashew nuts in the hand."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is vinaigre balsamique, which is the dark brown liquid drizzled on top of the salad items in the bowl. It is spread thinly and does not pool heavily at the bottom, suggesting a small amount. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The vinaigre balsamique covers the visible surface of the salad pieces lightly. Considering the bowl is small (approximately 12 cm diameter typical for single salad servings), the vinaigre balsamique layer is very thin, approximately 1-2 mm depth in localized spots. Step 3: Density Considerations - Vinaigre balsamique is a liquid with density close to water (around 1.2 g/ml). Its spread is light and not a large volume. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Typical dressing servings range between 5-15 grams for a small side salad. Visually, this looks to be on the lower side given limited coverage and thin layer. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Compared to the solid components (tomato, radish, salad), the vinaigre balsamique volume is much smaller, about a few teaspoons amount which equals roughly 8 grams. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - The balsamic vinegar appears 5-10 times lighter than the salad components, consistent with a light drizzle. Therefore, a conservative estimate near 8 grams is appropriate, balancing thin coverage and small container size."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The myrtilles (blueberries) are located on the left-central part of the bowl. I count approximately 12 whole blueberries visible. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each blueberry is about 1.5 to 2 cm in diameter, typical for fresh blueberries. They are piled loosely in a small cluster, roughly 3-4 cm wide and 2 cm deep. Step 3: Density Considerations - Blueberries are relatively light fruit with skin included and watery interior. Average density is about 0.6 - 0.7 g/cm3. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - In Swiss portion context, this looks like a small to medium portion of blueberries arranged on porridge, not a large serving. Step 5: Cross-validation - The porridge portion size looks medium-sized; the blueberries cover a small area relative to the porridge volume, so weight should be smaller than the porridge weight. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - The myrtilles mass should logically be less than half the porridge mass, as is visually confirmed. For 12 medium blueberries, typical weight is around 1.5 to 2 grams each, so estimated 18-24 grams total. Considering the cluster size and some occluded berries, a middle ground estimate is about 20 grams. This aligns with the visual quantity and portion norms."

First, locate the target food item: the houmous au basilic is served in a small glass next to the plate. The amount of houmous in the glass appears to be a small serving, filling roughly one-third to half the glass. Considering the glass size relative to the plate and carrot sticks, it holds approximately 50 to 70 grams if fully filled. Since the glass is about half-filled, the volume corresponds to approximately 25 to 35 grams. Houmous has a dense, creamy texture with a density close to water or slightly denser (around 1 g/cm3), so weight and volume correlate closely. Given the reasonable small portion size and the fact this is a Swiss portion context (generally smaller than US), I estimate the houmous au basilic weight to be around 30 grams."

The target food item is ""oeuf"" (egg). Step 1: Visual Identification - There is one half of a boiled egg visible on the upper right part of the plate. It appears to be a regular-sized egg half. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - A boiled egg half typically weighs about half of a whole egg. A whole medium egg (Swiss portion) weighs about 50 grams. The thickness and size correspond well to a half of a typical boiled egg. Step 3: Density Considerations - Boiled egg is dense with water and protein content, so weight correlates well with visible size. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The portion is exactly one half of an egg, so roughly half of 50 grams, which is 25 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - No other eggs or egg pieces visible; portion does not seem smaller or larger than a half egg. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - Compared to other foods on the plate (rice, vegetables), the egg half has a density and size consistent with this estimate. No container weight is included. Therefore, the weight of the egg half is estimated at 25 grams."

Step 1: The target food is 'salade verte avec sauce', which corresponds to the few pieces of green lettuce leaves with some dressing on a white plate. Step 2: Visually, the serving is very small—about 8-10 pieces of lettuce leaves scattered on a standard-sized dinner plate (approx. 26 cm diameter). Each leaf appears thin and light. There is no significant bulk or piled volume, and the dressing visible is minimal. Step 3: Considering lettuce is a very light food with low density and high water content, the weight will be low compared to volume. Step 4: Typical small salad servings in Switzerland are smaller than US portions. A few leaves like this usually weigh between 10-20 grams. Step 5: Given the small quantity and the sparse distribution, this portion corresponds to a very small serving, closer to the lower end of the range. Step 6: Cross check: The lettuce leaves occupy only a small fraction of the plate surface, and no other food is present for comparison. There is no contained volume or hidden layers to estimate further weight. Therefore, a conservative estimate is about 15 grams for this small portion of salad with dressing. The dressing weight is excluded as per instructions."
2ahgvr,graines de chia,8.0,12,4.0,0.0034038932028507603,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/aa859e5b-563f-472c-9914-036722ebf60e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visually identify the graines de chia in the bowl. The chia seeds are the small black and grey specks mixed throughout the creamy white mixture. They are spread evenly and do not form clumps, indicating a relatively small volume. Step 2: Dimension analysis shows the bowl is a standard small cereal bowl (around 14 cm diameter). The chia seeds are dispersed on the surface and throughout the mixture, but the actual volume they occupy is minimal. The mixture's thickness suggests the chia seeds are fully integrated, so the volume of chia is roughly the surface area multiplied by a very thin layer. Step 3: Considering the density of chia seeds which is quite high for their volume (approx 1.3 g/cm3), and the fact that they are present in small quantity, typical serving for chia seeds in such a bowl would range between 10g to 20g. Step 4: Swiss portions tend to be moderate or smaller. The amount of visible seeds suggests a medium to small portion rather than a large one. Step 5: Cross-validation with other items in the bowl (blanc battu, flocons d'avoine, miel) supports the chia to be a minor component by weight since the mixture is predominantly blanc battu (whipped egg white) and oats. Step 6: Taking into account visual density, spread, container size, and typical portion size, I estimate the weight of graines de chia in the bowl to be about 12 grams, which aligns with a small to medium serving. This avoids overestimation of the seeds' weight given their fine dispersion and small volume occupied."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is 'oignon' (onion). The only visible onion parts are the small green chopped pieces on top of the ham slice. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - By comparing the onion pieces to the bread slice and ham on the plate, the chopped onion pieces look very small and thin, totaling roughly a teaspoon or less, distributed softly over the meat. Step 3: Density Considerations - Onions are moderately dense vegetables, but when chopped finely, the weight is small even if the volume looks a bit larger. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The amount of chopped onion corresponds to a very small portion, likely under 10 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Compared to other items (two radishes, pieces of salami, slice of bread with ham), the onion pieces weight seems minimal. Step 6: Final estimate - the chopped onion weight is approximately 5 grams, considering the small quantity spread on the ham."

Step 1: The target food item is 'bout de gruyère' which is a piece of Gruyère cheese located in the middle of the plate, a single rectangular slice. Step 2: Dimension analysis shows the cheese piece is about 12 cm long, roughly 2 cm wide, and about 1 cm thick. This size estimation is based on comparison with visible items such as carrot sticks, apple slices, and baguette pieces on the plate. Step 3: Gruyère cheese is dense, with a typical density around 1.02 g/cm³, meaning the volume closely translates into weight without major distortion. Step 4: Volume calculated as approximately 12 cm × 2 cm × 1 cm = 24 cm³. Given the density, estimated weight is around 24 grams. Step 5: This portion size is consistent with a small to medium cheese slice typical in a Swiss portion context. There are no other cheese pieces to add. Step 6: Cross-validation with other foods shows this slice is smaller in volume than the bread or meat slices, confirming the weight estimate is plausible and not overestimated. Final estimate: the slice of Gruyère weighs approximately 24 grams."

The target food item is ""graines de courge"" (pumpkin seeds). Step 1: Visual Identification. The pumpkin seeds are sparsely mixed throughout the dish, scattered among couscous, tuna, and cucumber chunks. They appear as small, dark, flat seeds visible mainly on the surface and slightly embedded within the mixture. Step 2: Dimension Analysis. The container is a medium sized glass box likely ~15 cm width and ~6 cm height. The pumpkin seeds themselves are small, usually around 1-2 cm each, with only a few visible clusters scattered in small quantities. Step 3: Density Considerations. Pumpkin seeds are dense and small, so despite their size, weight can add moderately. However, the visible quantity is low. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration. Visually, the pumpkin seeds appear to be a small garnish amount rather than a main ingredient. Estimating roughly 10-15 grams total given their sparse spread and typical density, favoring the low end due to limited visible seeds. Step 5: Cross-Validation. Compared to the couscous and tuna, the pumpkin seeds volume seems much smaller, likely 1/10th or less of the tuna portion weight. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation. If the couscous and vegetables are in the 200-300g range, then pumpkin seeds at ~10-15g is reasonable and consistent. Concluding, I estimate the weight of graines de courge as 12 grams."

The target food is 'tartine avec crème de marrons et beurre' which means a slice of bread with chestnut cream and butter spread on top. Step 1: Visually, the tartine is a single slice of toasted bread, approximately 10 cm long and 5-6 cm wide, placed on a standard white plate. Step 2: The bread slice thickness appears to be about 1 to 1.2 cm typical for a French tartine. Step 3: Estimating bread weight for a slice of this size is about 25-30 g. The spread on top consists of chestnut cream and butter, visibly spread unevenly but lightly over the entire slice. The amount of spread appears modest, roughly 1.5 to 2 teaspoons total (about 15-20 grams combined). Chestnut cream is dense and buttery is fat-dense but the volume is limited. Step 4: Adding these, bread about 27 g plus spread about 18 g totals approximately 45 g for the entire tartine including toppings. Step 5: The instruction is to estimate only the target food item: 'tartine avec crème de marrons et beurre' means the whole open sandwich including bread and spreads. Since the bread is integral to the tartine, we include it. Step 6: No container weight to subtract. Step 7: Swiss portion sizes are smaller than US, and this portion looks small, consistent with a small single tartine. Step 8: No other items overlap or confuse volume. Final estimate is approximately 45 grams for the whole tartine including bread, chestnut cream and butter."

Step 1: The target food item is mayonnaise, which is spread on one slice of pain bis (brown bread). It is applied thinly and evenly across the entire surface of the slice. Step 2: The bread slice is typical Swiss pain bis, roughly the size of a hand, approximately 12 cm long and 7-8 cm wide. The mayonnaise layer appears thin, around 1-2 mm thick, and covers the slice fully except near the edges. Step 3: Mayonnaise is dense and oily, with a density around 0.9 g/ml; for thin spreads, weight estimates correspond mostly to surface area × thickness × density. Step 4: Surface area is approximately 12 cm × 7.5 cm = 90 cm². Thickness estimated at 1.5 mm = 0.15 cm. Volume = 90 × 0.15 = 13.5 cm³. At density ~0.9 g/cm³, estimated weight = 13.5 × 0.9 = 12.15 g. Step 5: Portion size for Swiss context: this is a thin spread, likely a small-medium amount of mayonnaise on bread. Step 6: Cross-validation: visually this matches a typical thin mayonnaise spread on a single bread slice, not a heavy dollop or thick layer. Final estimate: approximately 12 g of mayonnaise."

The target food item is ""fromages (manchego, 2 sortes de gruyères, raclette)"". In the image, there are four slices of cheese arranged on a plate, next to a slice of seeded bread. The four pieces appear to be different types of cheese, consistent with the description: manchego, two types of gruyère, and raclette. Each cheese slice varies slightly in size but generally is thin and of moderate dimensions, roughly comparable but smaller than the bread slice which offers a size reference. The bread slice is typical in size for a small slice of artisanal bread, approx 40-50g. Cheese slices are uniformly thin, roughly 3-4 cm in length and 2-3 cm width on average, and appear roughly 3-5 mm thick. Cheeses such as manchego, gruyère, and raclette tend to be dense dairy products, so their weight per volume is relatively high (approx 1.1 to 1.3 g/cm3 density). Visually, the stack of all four pieces would fill a volume of approximately 30-40 cm3 combined. Considering density and volume, the total cheese weight should be in the 30-40g range. Given that the pieces are thin slices and not a large block, a reasonable medium portion estimate is about 35g total for the combined cheeses shown. This fits within Swiss portion sizes, which tend to be smaller than US portions. Therefore, the total estimated weight for all the cheeses combined is 35g."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The oeuf au plat (fried egg) is clearly visible on the plate's lower left side. It is a single egg, fully cooked with yolk slightly visible and white spread out but contained. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Compared with the plate and other items, the fried egg covers roughly 8-9 cm in diameter including white edges. Typical fried eggs from Swiss medium eggs weigh around 50 grams excluding any oil but considering some absorbed oil or cooking weight, the white portion spreads fully and yolk is intact. Step 3: Density Considerations - Eggs are dense and compact, so the visual size fairly corresponds to its actual weight. There is no cut or missing portion; entire fried egg shown. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - This appears to be a single medium-size egg fried, typical portion around 50 g. Step 5: Cross-validation - Other foods on plate appear standard portion sizes; egg size relative to cherry tomatoes, bulgur, and feta all reasonable. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - The egg is likely heavier than individual cherry tomatoes but less than the bulgur serving. Considering all steps, a weight of approximately 50 grams matches visual and typical Swiss portion size for one fried egg. No container weight included per instructions."

Step 1: Visual identification - The target food item is a single croissant au chocolat, visible in the center of the image and partially bitten on one end. Step 2: Dimension analysis - The croissant is held in one hand, giving a reference for size. It appears about 12-14 cm long and about 6-7 cm wide at the widest part. Thickness appears standard for a croissant, around 3-4 cm. Step 3: Density considerations - Croissants are flaky pastry but contain buttery layers making them moderately dense. The chocolate inside adds some density but not significantly heavy. The toppings visible suggest some added crunch, but minimal additional weight. Step 4: Portion size calibration - Compared to typical Swiss bakery portions, this croissant is average-sized. Typical chocolate croissants in Switzerland range from 70 to 90 grams. Given the size and visible flakiness, estimate towards the middle range. Step 5: Cross-validation - No other foods to compare inside the package, but the size against the hand fits typical croissant weights. Step 6: Relative weight validation - N/A. Final estimate accounting for the partial bite removed is approximately 80 grams, assuming the bite took off about 5-10 grams, the original croissant might have been roughly 90 grams, but visible portion weighs around 80 grams."

The target food is 'haricots rouges' (red kidney beans). First, I locate the red kidney beans in the image: the reddish-purple beans piled on the left side of the plate. They appear to be a single portion, not mixed or layered with other foods. Counting the visible beans yields roughly 30-40 beans, but that's less relevant than the overall volume. Visually, the beans occupy about one quarter of the plate's visible surface area, roughly the same area as the pasta portion. The plate is a standard size (approximately 25-27 cm diameter), so the bean portion surface is about 6-7 cm wide by 5-6 cm deep. The beans are likely cooked, appearing moist and slightly glossy, suggesting some water content. Cooked kidney beans are dense but hydrated, with a density near 0.9-1.0 g/cm3. The pile is moderately thick, about 1.5-2 cm depth, indicating some bulk. Given these dimensions, the beans are likely about 80-100 grams in weight. Compared to the pasta portion, the beans are visually similar or slightly smaller in volume but denser. The Swiss portion style is smaller than US portions, so I note this is a moderate serving, not large. Cross-validation with other foods confirms the bean portion is less than the pasta (usually 100-130g cooked) and more than a very small garnish. Therefore, a reasonable and conservative estimate is around 90 grams of cooked haricots rouges."

Step 1: Visual identification. The target food is a single piece of feuilleté sauce tomate, visible clearly as a small individual pastry with tomato sauce inside. There is only one piece visible. Step 2: Dimension analysis. The feuilleté sits directly on a wooden surface, which provides some scale—wooden table planks usually have grooves roughly 1-2 cm wide. The feuilleté appears about 3-4 cm wide and 2-3 cm high. Thickness/depth seems around 2-3 cm as well, due to the puff pastry layers puffed up with air pockets. Step 3: Density considerations. Puff pastry is light and flaky, so low density but the sauce adds weight. The tomato sauce filling is dense and moist but small in volume. Step 4: Portion size calibration. Given Swiss smaller portions and the size of the piece (small, bite-sized), the weight would be on the lower side, expected between 15-30 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation. A single mini puff pastry with tomato filling from a Swiss context often weighs about 20-25 g. Step 6: Relative weight validation. There are no other foods for comparison in the image, so relying on typical puff pastry-bite weights is necessary. Conclusion: Estimating about 22 grams is a reasonable and conservative estimate for this single feuilleté sauce tomate based on visual size and density."

The target food item is 'crème de marrons' visible on a piece of bread. Step 1, visual identification: The crème de marrons is spread on the bread slice, covering about half the surface with some thickness. Step 2, dimension analysis: The visible bread slice appears to be about 10cm long and 4-5cm wide. The crème de marrons layer looks roughly 2-3 mm thick on average. Step 3, density considerations: Chestnut cream is dense and somewhat sticky, similar in density to thick jam or puree, roughly 1.1 g/cm3. Step 4, portion size calibration: Calculating the area roughly 10cm x 4.5cm = 45 cm2, and 0.25 cm depth multiplied gives a volume of about 11.25 cm3. Multiplying by density (1.1 g/cm3) yields approximately 12.5 grams. Given some variability on spread thickness and coverage, a weight around 12 grams is reasonable for a moderate portion. Step 5, cross-validation: The crème de marrons layer is clearly less than half the weight of the bread slice itself. The bread slice of this size is likely around 25-30 grams, so the chestnut cream is consistent with being about half that or less. Step 6, relative weight validation: Compared to typical servings of spreads on bread in Swiss context, this amount matches a small to medium spread portion. The estimate is therefore 12 grams. No container weight is included and visual evidence supports this estimate."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is 'chocolat,' represented by two small chocolate bunny figures. There are two pieces visible. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each chocolate bunny is approximately the size of a small piece of chocolate, estimated to be around 4-5 cm tall and 3-4 cm wide, judging by the texture and surface they stand on, which looks like a regular table surface without any other size reference but comparable to usual small chocolate figures. Step 3: Density Considerations - Chocolate is dense, so these small bunny shapes, despite their small volume, have relatively significant weight. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - In Switzerland, chocolate bunny figures of this size are usually around 20-30 grams each. Since these pieces look solid and standard in size (neither tiny nor oversized), the medium range around 25 grams is most plausible per bunny. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Two bunnies together weigh about 50 grams total, but since we only estimate one piece, the weight is about 25 grams. Step 6: Systematic Bias Check - There is no overestimation risk as the objects are small and compact. No container is included, and visible volume matches the weight estimate. Therefore, the estimated weight of one chocolate bunny is 25 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification: The target food is 'avocat' (avocado). In the image, there is one visible slice of avocado approximately 1 large strip near the top center of the wrap. Step 2: Dimension Analysis: The avocado slice is about 10 cm long, around 2.5-3 cm wide, and roughly 1-1.5 cm thick. Comparing to the size of the wrap and other elements (grated cheese, ham slice), it is a typical medium slice. Step 3: Density Considerations: Avocado flesh is moderately dense and creamy, with a typical density close to 0.96 g/cm3. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration: A thin avocado slice of this size usually weighs between 30 to 50 grams; this slice is close to a medium portion of avocado taken from about one-fourth of a medium avocado fruit. Step 5: Cross-Validation: Relative to the other fillings, the avocado portion is smaller than ham slice and cheese amount, consistent with a moderate weight. Step 6: Bias Check: The portion is substantial but not overly thick, so no significant overestimation risk. Based on the visual size and typical avocado slice weights, an estimate of 40 grams is reasonable and fits Swiss portion context."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The cervelas is the diced pinkish sausage pieces visible mixed in the chili mixture on the right side of the plate. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The pieces of cervelas are roughly 2 to 3 cm cubes, with about 10 to 12 visible pieces. The cervelas is partially mixed within the chili sauce and beans, so some volume is hidden under the sauce. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cervelas is a dense, processed sausage meat. Each piece is heavier relative to its size compared to vegetables. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given the portion is moderate, typical Swiss portion size for cervelas pieces in such a dish is around 100-150 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Relative to the pasta on the plate, the cervelas portion looks about equal to or slightly smaller than the pasta portion by volume but denser. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - Considering the dense sausage chunks and the portion visible, a medium portion estimate towards the middle of the 100-150g range is reasonable. Therefore, an estimate of 130 grams for the cervelas on the plate is accurate and fits visual evidence."

Step 1: The target food item is 'tonic au gingembre,' which is a ginger tonic drink visible as a clear bottle labeled 'GINGER.' Step 2: The bottle appears to be a standard small glass beverage bottle around 200-250 ml typical size in Swiss contexts, smaller than US portions. Step 3: Considering the density of a tonic drink is close to water, approximately 1 gram per milliliter, the weight of the liquid content corresponds roughly to its volume. Step 4: The bottle is almost full but slightly consumed. I estimate about 200 ml of liquid remaining in the bottle. Step 5: Given the density and volume estimation, the liquid tonic au gingembre weighs approximately 200 grams. Step 6: Container weight is excluded as per instructions, so only the drink's liquid weight is estimated. Hence, a medium small drink portion of roughly 200 grams is reasonable and coherent with visible size and typical Swiss portioning."
