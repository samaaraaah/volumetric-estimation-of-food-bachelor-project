The image shows a single waffle (gaufre) on a plate. The waffle appears to be a standard size, approximately 10 cm x 10 cm, and is not overly thick. Waffles of this size typically weigh around 50-60 grams. Since there is no visible indication of additional toppings or fillings that would add weight to the waffle itself, I will estimate the weight of the waffle alone based on its size and typical density."

The specified food item is 'huile de lin' (flaxseed oil). In the image, there is no visible pool or drizzle of oil that can be directly observed. However, it is likely that the oil has been used as a dressing or mixed into the dish, but its quantity cannot be visually estimated. Since the task requires estimating only what is visible, and no clear amount of oil is discernible, I cannot provide a weight estimate for this item."

The specified food item is 'graines de chia' (chia seeds). In the image, the chia seeds are mixed into a bowl of blanc battu (a type of yogurt or soft cheese), along with oats and honey. Chia seeds are small and dense, and their distribution throughout the mixture suggests a moderate quantity was used. Based on the visible density of the seeds in the mixture, it appears that approximately 1-2 tablespoons of chia seeds were added. A typical tablespoon of chia seeds weighs about 12 grams. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the chia seeds in this dish to be around 15 grams."

The 'salade de pâtes' is located at the bottom left of the plate. It consists of cooked pasta spirals mixed with small pieces of vegetables like green peppers, corn, and tomatoes, and appears to be lightly coated with a dressing. The portion is relatively small, covering a small section of the plate. Considering the density of cooked pasta and the visible volume, I estimate the weight of this portion to be approximately 80 grams."

The specified food item is 'asperges' (asparagus). In the image, there are approximately 6-7 spears of asparagus visible. These spears appear to be of medium thickness and cooked, which slightly reduces their weight compared to raw asparagus. A single medium spear of cooked asparagus typically weighs around 12-15 grams. Given the number of spears, the total weight can be estimated as 6 spears × 12-15 grams = 72-90 grams. To account for slight variations in size and cooking, I estimate the total weight to be approximately 80 grams."

The specified food item is 'tartine mélasse + beurre,' which is the slice of bread with molasses and butter visible in the lower part of the image. The bread slice appears to be a medium-thick piece of rustic bread, approximately 10 cm long and 5 cm wide. The butter is spread thinly, and the molasses layer is also light, as it is not pooling or overly thick. Based on the size and density of the bread, I estimate the bread itself to weigh around 30 grams. The butter and molasses together likely add about 5 grams (2 grams for butter and 3 grams for molasses). Combining these, the total weight of the 'tartine mélasse + beurre' is approximately 35 grams."

The poivron (red bell pepper) is visible in the image as thinly sliced pieces placed near the chicken. The slices appear to be cooked and seasoned, which may slightly reduce their weight compared to raw bell peppers due to water loss. Based on the visible portion, the slices seem to cover a small area of the plate and are not piled very high. Considering the typical density of cooked bell peppers and the volume visible, I estimate the weight of the poivron to be approximately 40 grams."
