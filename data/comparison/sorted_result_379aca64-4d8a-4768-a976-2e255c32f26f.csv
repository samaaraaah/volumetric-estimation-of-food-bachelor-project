The 'délice tomate mozzarella' consists of alternating slices of tomato and mozzarella, drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and sprinkled with herbs. From the image, there are approximately 5 slices of tomato and 5 slices of mozzarella. The tomato slices appear to be medium-sized and relatively thick, likely weighing around 20-25 grams each, giving a total of about 100-125 grams for the tomatoes. The mozzarella slices are also thick and appear to be from a fresh mozzarella ball, with each slice likely weighing around 25-30 grams, giving a total of about 125-150 grams for the mozzarella. Adding the olive oil and balsamic vinegar, which contribute minimally to the weight, the total weight of the 'délice tomate mozzarella' is estimated to be around 230-275 grams. I will take the midpoint of this range for the final estimate."
