xjvrtk,ananas,200.0,450,250.0,5.328786102525845,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/b41068f9-5a0e-4c11-bf1b-7389d3917889,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a blue plate with a collection of freshly cut pineapple pieces ('ananas'). There are 12 individual chunks of pineapple visible, each with a triangular shape. The pieces vary slightly in size but are mostly about 4-5 cm in length and about 2-3 cm in thickness. The chunks are solid, juicy fruit with moderate density. Comparing the size to the plate which appears to be a standard medium-sized dinner plate (approx. 24 cm diameter), the piece sizes and quantity suggest a moderate portion. Pineapple is dense but watery; each piece likely weighs about 40 grams. Multiplying 12 pieces by approximately 40 grams gives about 480 grams. Considering some size variation and outer skin removal, a slightly adjusted estimate would be around 450 grams total weight for the pineapple pieces shown."
2ahgvr,porridge salé,48.0,270,222.0,1.135670894170308,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a35f3211-3b33-4826-97b8-3af69655dada,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a glass jar with a gold-colored lid containing 'porridge salé.' The jar appears to have a diameter of about 7 cm (as indicated on the lid) and a height of approximately 7-8 cm, with the porridge filling about 80% of the jar's volume. The porridge appears dense, semi-solid with visible grain texture characteristic of oats soaked in liquid, showing a thickness just below the rim. Considering the jar's approximate volume (around 300-350 ml) and the density of cooked porridge, which is typically about 1.0 g/ml, the filled portion likely weighs close to 250-280 grams. Taking into account minor air pockets and the jar's fill level, I estimate the weight of the 'porridge salé' inside the jar to be approximately 270 grams."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,230,187.0,8.310668229777256,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a shallow ceramic plate containing a tomato salad with visible slices of tomato topped with flax seeds (graines de lin) and some green leaves, likely herbs. The tomato pieces are cut mostly into wedges and some slices, with about 15-20 pieces visible. The tomato slices have an average thickness of about 1.5 cm as judged from the exposed edges and their internal seed compartments are visible, indicating fresh tomato flesh. The tomatoes fill most of the plate surface and the depth of the salad is roughly around 2-3 cm in places, considering layering of pieces. The plate diameter is estimated around 22-24 cm using the knife and fork nearby as size reference. The total volume of tomato pieces visible corresponds to a modest salad portion. The flax seeds sprinkled on top cover the tomato surface densely but add minimal weight; their contribution is negligible compared to the tomatoes themselves. Tomato density is high due to water content but the salad's volume and slice thickness suggest a weight roughly between 200-250 grams. Considering some tomatoes might overlap and the plate is not fully heaped, a reasonable estimate is about 230 grams of tomato salad itself, excluding dressing and seeds. Since the target is 'salade de tomates,' this weight corresponds to the plated tomato portion observed. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'salade de tomates' is 230 grams."
p96w4a,délice tomate mozzarella,54.0,210,156.0,0.8977938825535543,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/5ebafbd6-315d-44a6-8508-ba143d23adb2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is ""délice tomate mozzarella,"" which is visually identified on the left side of the plate as alternating slices of tomato and mozzarella, stacked vertically and drizzled with balsamic vinegar and herbs. There are 7 visible slices of tomato and 6 slices of mozzarella, arranged in an overlapping pattern. Each slice of tomato appears roughly 1.5 cm thick, about 5 to 6 cm wide, and the mozzarella slices are similar in size but slightly thicker, about 1.7 cm thick. The tomato slices are fresh and contain water, so their density is lower than mozzarella, which is denser (soft cheese). Thickness and volume suggest a pile about 3 cm high when considering the alternating stack. Given the plate size reference (standard dinner plate, approx. 25 cm diameter), the total length of the stack is approximately 15-17 cm. Tomato slice volume estimated at about 30 cm³ per slice, mozzarella slightly more dense with about 35 cm³ per slice. Multiplying by slice count and factoring density (tomato approx 0.95g/cm³, mozzarella approx 1.05g/cm³) results in roughly 200 grams total. The tomato contributes around 100 grams (7 slices), and mozzarella around 110 grams (6 slices). Considering some overlap and minor sauce weight ignored, I estimate the weight of the délice tomate mozzarella to be approximately 210 grams."
p8a2w5,dahl de lentille,281.0,160,121.0,3.623681125439625,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/5ddea52e-8411-4822-893f-d8420fa6cb40,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a white bowl containing a mix of rice and dahl de lentille. The dahl de lentille appears mixed in with the rice but is distinguished by its orange color and chunkier texture with visible lentils and vegetables such as carrots. The bowl is about half full, and the portion visible of dahl de lentille occupies roughly half of the visible food quantity with rice underneath. Comparing the size of the bowl to the fork nearby and the laptop keyboard in the background, the bowl is of typical medium size (about 12 cm diameter). The depth of the food inside the bowl is about 3-4 cm based on the visible fill level. Dahl de lentille, cooked with lentils and vegetables, has a moderate density, denser than rice but hydrated and soft. The total portion visible likely totals around 300-350 grams combined, with the dahl de lentille representing approximately half of the volume. Considering density and visible volume, I estimate the dahl de lentille weight to be approximately 160 grams."
8japfq,ratatouille,196.0,80,116.0,2.423105616540552,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/b6659a8f-25e7-44f7-a351-7873f60f1586,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'ratatouille,' located towards the top-right section of the plate in the image. The ratatouille appears as a chunky vegetable stew with visible pieces of eggplant, zucchini, and tomato in a sauce. It is a mixed, somewhat moist and dense vegetable preparation. Visually, the ratatouille occupies about one-fifth of the plate's surface area. Considering the plate is a standard dinner plate, approximately 25 cm wide, and the pile of ratatouille has some volume with pieces layered and slightly mounded, the depth can be roughly estimated at around 1.5-2 cm. The width and length of the ratatouille pile roughly correspond to about 8 cm by 6 cm visually. Multiplying these dimensions (8 x 6 x 1.7 cm average depth) gives a volume estimate around 80 cm3. Given that cooked vegetable stews like ratatouille have a density close to 1 g/cm3 due to moisture content, the weight estimate corresponds closely to the volume in grams. Taking into account any minor foam or air gaps, a reasonable approximation is around 75-85 grams. I estimate the weight of the ratatouille to be 80 grams based strictly on visible portion size, density, and plate size reference."
xjvrtk,tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe,250.0,135,115.0,3.064052008952361,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/f607625b-a07d-423e-a564-4d96ebadf084,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows one slice of tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe on a small plate. The slice is roughly triangular, covering about half the plate surface. The plate diameter appears to be around 20 cm based on typical dinnerware size. The slice itself is approximately 12 cm wide at the crust edge and about 14 cm long to the tip. The thickness of the slice, judging from the edge, is about 1.5 cm, including the thin crispy crust and fruit topping. The topping consists of diced rhubarb pieces and possibly thin apple slices embedded in a creamy base with cinnamon sprinkled on top. Considering this is a baked pastry with fruit topping, the density is moderate—denser than pure fruit due to the crust and creamy layer, but lighter than solid cake. The visible amount of fruit and the creamy layer contribute to weight but in moderate volume. Taking into account the dimensions and density of similar fruit tart slices, this serving likely weighs between 120 and 150 grams. I estimate the weight of this tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe slice as approximately 135 grams."
p96w4a,cervelas,130.0,240,110.0,1.5240328253223916,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/58f82c5a-4b79-4f95-9f8f-0b55a93d8383,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'cervelas,' which is visible as diced pieces mixed throughout the chili portion on the right side of the plate. Visually, there are approximately 12 distinct chunks of cervelas, which are roughly cubical, with each piece about 2.5 cm on each side. The chili sauce and kidney beans partially cover the pieces but the surface visibility is clear enough for counting. Considering the density of cooked sausage-like cervelas, which is quite dense and meaty, each piece can be estimated around 20 grams on average. Multiplying by 12 pieces results in approximately 240 grams total. Some hidden volume might be present under the visible pieces, but this is balanced by some chili sauce volume around them. Therefore, a conservative yet visually grounded weight estimate of the cervelas is 240 grams."
ppf8hc,pâtes carbonara,236.0,140,96.0,2.4145795587765106,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/4d4e6539-b86f-4019-b2aa-0c15dbce0667,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a white plate with a serving of pâtes carbonara topped with shredded gruyère cheese. The pasta portion is a mix of penne and some shell pasta, coated with a creamy sauce and small pieces of meat (presumably bacon or pancetta). The pasta pile covers a roughly circular area of about 12-14 cm diameter on the plate. The depth of the pasta mound, judging by visible edges and the piled cheese, appears to be around 2-3 cm thick. The amount of shredded gruyère on top is a small mound covering the center, approximately 3-4 cm in diameter and about 0.5-1 cm thick. The density of cooked pasta with sauce and meat is relatively high, estimated around 1.2 g/cm3 due to moisture and fat content, while shredded cheese is lighter but compact. Considering visual volume, the pasta portion likely weighs about 130-160 grams, and the shredded cheese on top approximately 10-15 grams. Since the target food is pâtes carbonara (including the creamy pasta and bits of meat but excluding the cheese itself which is a separate item), the estimation focuses solely on the pasta with sauce and meat. Therefore, subtracting the cheese weight, the pâtes carbonara portion weighs around 140 grams."
2ahgvr,brochette de boeuf,76.0,165,89.0,0.7208781839496963,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/5b8a0853-ecc4-4015-bc9a-2b50766f873a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is the 'brochette de boeuf' which is located near the top center of the plate. It consists of three chunks of beef threaded onto a wooden skewer. Each beef chunk appears relatively thick and roughly cube-shaped, measuring about 3-4 cm per side based on comparison to the slice of bread on the plate and the sausage below. Considering the thickness visually comparable to a typical skewer meat piece and the density of cooked beef, each chunk likely weighs approximately 50-60 grams. With three pieces, the total weight is around 150-180 grams. Factoring in small air gaps and slight shrinkage from cooking, a reasonable estimate for the entire brochette is 165 grams."
p96w4a,purée de pdt,214.0,125,89.0,2.0298412021741448,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/828972fc-fa12-4270-a960-fc59367fc91e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a white plate with a serving of purée de pdt (mashed potatoes), topped with meat stew and carrots plus sauce. The mashed potatoes portion is visible as roughly a scoop about 9 cm long, 7 cm wide, and about 2 cm thick, judging by comparison to the plate diameter (standard dinner plate around 25 cm). The purée has a smooth and dense appearance but is soft and aerated, typical for mashed potatoes. The surface is partially covered by meat and sauce but the underlying purée volume can be roughly estimated. Based on these dimensions, the volume is approximately 9 cm x 7 cm x 2 cm = 126 cm³. Mashed potatoes have a density close to 1 g/cm³, so the weight is approximately 126 grams. Considering slight compression and moisture content, a weight estimate of about 125 grams is reasonable."
p8a2w5,artichaut,143.0,230,87.0,1.3259085580304806,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/9b2c7383-a434-4260-ac30-86103e4546ea,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows one whole artichaut placed on a round white plate. The artichoke is whole and intact with visible outer leaves and a small stem, clearly not cut or portioned. The plate is held by a hand, which provides a visual size reference; the artichoke seems to be roughly the length of the width of an average palm, estimating around 10-12 cm in length and about 7-8 cm in width. The artichoke appears dense with thick, fleshy leaves typical of cooked artichokes. Considering the depth given by the visible side profile and the compact structure of the vegetable, the volume and density combine for a moderate weight. Typical medium-sized whole artichokes weigh between 200 to 350 grams; this one appears slightly smaller than medium size but still substantial. Given the visual cues and density of artichokes, a conservative and accurate estimate for the weight of this single artichoke on the plate is approximately 230 grams."
wrah5h,fondant au chocolat maison,73.0,155,82.0,0.6379622721943942,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1be13f84-6a0b-4b1c-bff5-fc0a0fcf87b8,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single slice of fondant au chocolat maison placed on a white square plate. The slice is triangular with a rounded edge. Visually, the length of the slice from tip to crust edge measures about 12 cm, based on comparison with the nearby cup handle partially visible. The width at the widest part is approximately 6 cm. The thickness (height) of the slice is about 3.5 cm, as we can see the side profile clearly indicating a dense but moist texture typical of chocolate fondant cakes. The surface is cracked and looks slightly crumbly but compact inside, suggesting a dense caloric content. Considering the dense texture which is typical of chocolate fondant, a slice of this size is visually consistent with about 140 to 170 grams in weight. Taking midpoint and the visual evidence into account, I estimate the weight of this fondant au chocolat maison slice to be 155 grams."
wrah5h,"délice des dieux (biscuit, fruits rouges, séré+mascarpone)",205.0,130,75.0,1.6386017265266972,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/5de398c7-684b-448d-ba0a-f318d009bccd,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a square piece of délice des dieux on a plate, topped with fresh red fruits - specifically two raspberries and two blueberries. The dessert has three visible layers: a pinkish biscuit base soaked with juice, a thick creamy white mascarpone and séré layer on top, and fresh fruits placed on top. The piece measures approximately 8 cm by 8 cm in surface area, inferred by comparing to the plate diameter which seems to be around 20 cm. The dessert has a visible cream thickness of about 1.5 cm and the biscuit base appears about 1 cm thick, giving an overall approximate thickness of 2.5 cm. The cream layer is dense but aerated mascarpone+séré, and the biscuit is moderately dense and moist soaked with fruit juice, while the fresh fruits add some weight but are light individually. Given that the whole portion is a single square piece and that similar layered desserts typically weigh between 100-150g for similar size, and accounting for the density of cream combined with the spongy biscuit base and fresh fruit, the approximate weight should be closer to around 130 grams. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the délice des dieux portion shown to be about 130 grams."

The image shows pieces of fresh tomatoes mixed with cucumber chunks on a decorated plate. Focusing on the tomatoes, I count roughly 8 visible pieces of tomato, cut into irregular wedges. Each tomato piece is about 2-3 cm long and appears moderately thick with some juice visible, indicating freshness and density typical of ripe tomatoes. By comparing the tomato pieces to the cucumber slices and the plate diameter, the total tomato volume looks moderate, covering a small portion of the plate. Tomatoes have a density close to water, so volume equates closely to weight. Each tomato piece likely weighs about 15 grams on average. Multiplying by 8 pieces gives an estimated total weight around 120 grams. Given some variation in piece size and possible small unseen tomato bits mixed in, I estimate the weight of tomatoes as about 120 grams."
wrah5h,betterave,65.0,137,72.0,0.49877437919641904,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/bba5cf64-1d08-40cb-bc6c-bfdd2a7c2116,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with six distinct food items: quinoa, diced beetroot (betterave), mango, cucumber, tomato, and avocado. The target food item is betterave. The beetroot pieces are dark red, cubed, and located at about 10 o'clock on the plate. They appear to be cut into firm, even chunks. There are approximately 15 visible beetroot cubes clustered together. Dimension-wise, each cube appears to be about 2 cm per side based on comparison with the tomato slices and cucumber pieces nearby. Assuming a roughly cubic shape, this gives each cube a volume of about 8 cm3. Beetroot is quite dense with an approximate density around 1 g/cm3, so each cube likely weighs about 8 grams. Multiplying by 15 cubes gives 120 grams. Considering potential slight hidden volume beneath the visible cubes and some variation in size, an adjustment upwards by about 15-20% is reasonable, bringing the estimate to approximately 135-140 grams. To remain conservative but precise, I estimate the betterave weight at 137 grams."

The image shows a small green bowl containing three strawberries with visible green leafy caps. Each strawberry appears whole and uncut. Comparing their size to the bowl, which looks like a small dessert or dipping bowl (approximately 10 cm diameter), the strawberries are quite large, almost filling the bowl. Each strawberry seems relatively thick and dense, with a length around 5-6 cm and width around 3-4 cm. Considering the typical density of fresh strawberries, which is relatively high and includes the skin and leaves, an average large strawberry of this size typically weighs around 25-30 grams. There are three strawberries, similarly sized but one slightly smaller. Estimating their combined weight with minor variation, I calculate roughly 80 grams in total for the three strawberries."

The target food, 'cottage cheese aux herbes,' is located near the bottom center of the plate. It is a small but distinct pile of white curds with visible herb flakes mixed throughout. The portion is spread but compact, roughly 4 cm wide and 2 cm thick on the plate surface. Compared to the adjacent fried egg and other items like hummous and olives, the curds have a light, semi-dense texture typical of cottage cheese. The pile resembles a standard small serving of cottage cheese found in single servings, which typically ranges between 80-120 grams. Given the size relative to the whole plate and the density, I estimate the portion to be approximately 100 grams, accounting for the herbs mixed in without additional bulk. This estimation is consistent with a small side portion of cottage cheese served with herbs in a meal."
ppf8hc,poivrons jaune,150.0,90,60.0,0.9591814984546521,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/95e84def-c82b-4360-8390-f5153ff61064,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'poivrons jaune' (yellow peppers). In the image, there is one small to medium-sized yellow bell pepper cut into three pieces: one main hollowed half filled with quinoa and bulgur au curry, and two separate smaller slices placed on the plate. The pieces appear cooked, as indicated by the softened and slightly shriveled texture and some browning on the edges. The main pepper half, judging by comparison to the white plate and fork nearby, is about 7-8 cm in height and 6-7 cm in diameter. The two slices together represent approximately half of the flesh of a typical pepper. The pepper's wall thickness looks to average around 0.7-1 cm. Considering the pepper has been hollowed and part of it is filled with quinoa and bulgur (which is excluded from the estimate), only the weight of the pepper flesh pieces visible should be counted. Cooked bell peppers have a density around 0.9 g/cm3 and lose some moisture during cooking but retain most weight. The total visible pepper flesh (main hollowed half plus two slices) corresponds roughly to about 110-130 grams fresh weight raw based on volume, but accounting for cooking moisture loss, the visible pieces together likely weigh about 85-95 grams. Taking a conservative median to reflect some possible dehydration and variation, I estimate the weight of the yellow peppers ('poivrons jaune') visible on the plate to be approximately 90 grams."

The image shows a glass container holding three distinct food items: bulgur, ratatouille, and two halves of a hard-boiled egg. The bulgur occupies roughly one-third of the container's base. Visually, the bulgur grains are swollen and cooked, appearing loose but compacted slightly. The container is a standard lunchbox-style glass container approximately 15 cm by 15 cm in dimension. The bulgur covers about 10 cm by 7 cm area, with an estimated depth around 1.5 cm based on visual thickness against the glass edges and relative density. Cooked bulgur typically has a density close to 1 g/cm³ due to water content. Calculating volume: 10 cm × 7 cm × 1.5 cm = 105 cm³ approximately, thus bulgur's weight is about 105 grams. Considering slight packing irregularities and the presence of some small vegetable pieces partially mixed in, adjusting slightly upwards to account for some hidden volume, a reasonable estimate is 110 grams for the bulgur portion."

The target food is 'polenta,' which is positioned on the right side of the dish in the image. Visually, the polenta is presented as a mound topped with shredded cheese. The shape is irregular but roughly a compact pile about 8 cm long, 6 cm wide, and with an estimated depth of about 3.5 cm when considering the cheese on top and the volume underneath it. Comparing the polenta size to the grilled eggplant slices and pork portion shows it is a moderate portion, not overly small or large. Polenta tends to have a soft but dense texture which means its density is relatively high but slightly less than solid meat. Given the volume approximation of around 168 cm³ (8x6x3.5), and a density estimate of polenta around 0.9 g/cm³ (taking cheese topping into account), the total weight is roughly 150 grams. This estimate excludes the container's weight and relies strictly on visible volume and texture indication."

The target food item is 'perle de blé' which are visible as small, round, white-yellowish grains clustered at the bottom left and scattered slightly around the bowl. They are mixed with a creamy saffron sauce (visible yellow coloring) and shrimp. The 'perle de blé' seem to cover roughly half the bottom surface of the bowl, underneath and between around 6 visible shrimp and beside a pile of flat, green beans (haricots coco). The bowl is medium-sized and the layer of 'perle de blé' appears to be around 1.5 to 2 cm thick, with some volume under the shrimp and the sauce coating them, indicating moisture and density. The density of cooked 'perle de blé' is moderate to dense, similar to cooked pasta or small grains. Given the visible quantity compared to the bowl size and relative to the shrimp, I estimate the portion of 'perle de blé' weighs approximately 80 grams."

The image shows two pieces of dessert on a dark plate, one is the tiramisu (left side) and the other is forêt noir (right side). The tiramisu slice is roughly rectangular with visible creamy layers on top and soaked sponge cake underneath. Its size is comparable to the forêt noir piece to the right. The plate has a diameter likely around 20 cm (standard dessert plate), and the tiramisu occupies about one-third of the plate's surface lengthwise, approximately 7-8 cm long, 3-4 cm wide. The height of the tiramisu is about 4-5 cm based on the cream layering visible on the side. The texture appears creamy with soaked cake, so the density can be considered medium due to cream and moist cake. Given typical tiramisu densities and the measured dimensions, I estimate the tiramisu weight to be between 120 and 140 grams. Considering some irregular edges and the moist texture, a reasonable estimate is about 130 grams."

The target food item is 'pain' (bread). In the image, there are two slices of bread on a white plate. Each slice is approximately the size of a typical sliced bread slice, with visible crumb and crust. The slices seem to be standard thickness for sandwich bread, slightly thicker than very thin commercial bread but not excessively thick. The size comparison with the plate, which appears to be a standard dinner plate of about 25 cm diameter, shows each slice occupies about one sixth to one eighth of the plate's surface. Standard sliced bread weighs about 30-40 grams per slice depending on thickness and density. These slices appear fairly dense with a consistent crumb structure typical of whole grain or country bread. Given the visual evidence, I estimate each slice to weigh approximately 40 grams. Since the input only asks for the weight of 'pain' singularly, I consider the total weight of the visible bread slices as the target portion, which is two slices. Therefore, the total weight for the visible 'pain' is estimated at about 80 grams."

The target food item is 'haricots rouges' (red kidney beans). In the image, these are located on the left side of the plate. They consist of individual kidney beans, dark red in color, with visible moisture/gloss indicating they are cooked. I count approximately 30-35 whole beans visible. They are not piled deeply but form a mostly single visible layer, with minimal hidden volume. Comparing their size to the spiral pasta next to them, beans appear roughly 2-3 cm long and about 1 cm thick. The plate diameter and the fork in the background provide a scale indicating this is a standard dinner plate (~25 cm diameter). The kidney beans are dense legumes, so their weight density is relatively high. A typical cooked kidney bean weighs about 1 gram. With 30-35 beans visible and limited hidden volume, total weight likely falls between 30 and 40 grams. The beans appear lightly garnished with some herb pieces but no additional volume. Therefore, an estimate of 35 grams is reasonable based on visual evidence and density considerations."

The image shows a single galette wrap on a plate. The wrap is fully visible and unrolled, with visible toppings of cream, avocado slices, shredded carrots, tomato slices, a folded slice of ham, and shredded cheese. The wrap is thin and approximately the size of a standard large tortilla, visually close to the diameter of the plate, estimated around 22-24 cm. The thickness of the wrap is minimal as it is flat, possibly around 2-3 mm. The consistency is like a whole wheat or multigrain flatbread based wrap. Typical density for such flatbread wraps is about 330-350 grams per square meter. Based on visual evidence, the diameter corresponds to a circle of ~22.5 cm radius 11.25 cm. Area = pi * r² ≈ 3.14 * (11.25)² ≈ 397.5 cm². Converting to m² = 0.03975 m². Weight estimate = 0.03975 m² * 340 g/m² (average) ≈ 13.5 grams. There are no visible thick layers or multiple wraps; this is a single wrap without added bulk. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the galette wrap itself as about 14 grams, considering slight thickness and small imperfections. This is lower than some standard wraps, but visually confirmed from the single thin wrap on the plate."

The image shows a bowl with sliced kiwi pieces placed on top of a white creamy substance, which is likely the séré maigre. The target food is 'kiwi'. The kiwi pieces are cut into about 1.5 to 2 cm thick slices, with a total visible count of approximately 14 pieces. The kiwi pieces cover roughly half of the bowl's surface. A standard whole kiwi weighs about 70 grams, and the visible pieces appear to be roughly equivalent to one medium-sized kiwi peeled and sliced. Taking into account the density and moisture content of kiwi, and that there is no visible kiwi skin, I estimate the peeled kiwi weight to be about 70 grams."

The image shows a single piece of pain aux fruits being held between the thumb and index finger. The piece appears roughly square with irregular edges and a textured crust containing visible nuts and sugar crystals. The width of the piece is approximately the width of two fingers, which from typical adult finger width suggests about 5-6 cm. The thickness is visible at the top edge, approximately 2-3 cm. The bread has a dense and slightly moist crumb consistent with fruit and nut bread, which increases density compared to regular bread. Considering the visible size and density, the weight is estimated by comparing it to an equivalent volume of dense fruit bread. The estimated volume is roughly 5.5cm x 5.5cm x 2.5cm = about 75 cubic centimeters. Given the density of dense fruit bread is approximately 0.6-0.7 grams per cubic cm, the weight would be between 45 and 52 grams. Adjusting slightly for the nuts and sugar which add density, I estimate the piece weighs around 50 grams."

The image shows a white bowl filled with milk and a visible layer of breakfast cereals floating on top. The cereal pieces are small to medium-sized clusters and flakes with some chocolate bits apparent. The spoon provides a reference for scale: the bowl's diameter is roughly 15-18 cm judging by the spoon size, and the cereal layer is relatively thin, about 1.5-2 cm deep, floating in the milk. The cereal covers about one-third of the bowl's surface area, spread relatively evenly. Considering that cereal clusters are light but denser than puffed cereals, and the partial submersion in milk, the total volume of dry cereal before absorbing milk appears to be low. Based on visual density, volume, and typical cereal portion sizes, this serving likely weighs between 25 to 40 grams. Given the visible amount, I estimate the cereals weigh approximately 30 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing apricot yogurt with visible small pieces of apricot. The yogurt fills the bowl to about 2.5 cm in height, considering typical small bowl dimensions (about 12 cm diameter). The yogurt appears to have a smooth, thick consistency with some embedded fruit pieces. Given that commercial apricot yogurts are dense and that the total volume appears to be roughly half a standard yogurt container portion, I estimate the content here to be around 125 grams. This takes into account the visible volume, density of the yogurt, and the small amount of added fruit pieces, avoiding include container weight."

The image shows a single scoop of vanilla ice cream ('boule de glace vanille') in a white bowl, partially covered with hot chocolate sauce. The scoop is roughly spherical and appears to be about the size of a small to medium ice cream scoop, visually comparable to a 6-7 cm diameter sphere. The depth and volume are consistent with a standard single ice cream scoop size. Considering the density of ice cream, which is lighter than water, the volume roughly corresponds to about 90-110 grams for one scoop. The hot chocolate sauce covering the ice cream does not add weight to the ice cream itself, and no container weight is included. Therefore, based on the visible size and density, I estimate the weight of the 'boule de glace vanille' to be approximately 100 grams."

The target food item is 'boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate.' Visually, these are the small round vegetable balls covered in tomato sauce placed on top of the pasta. I count 10 visible boulettes, roughly spherical, about the size of a large cherry tomato each. Comparing their size to the penne pasta (each about 4 cm long) and the plate, each boulette appears approximately 3 to 3.5 cm in diameter. They are covered in a moderate amount of tomato sauce but clearly distinguishable. Given the density of vegetable-based meatballs, which tend to be lighter than meatballs but denser than a mostly vegetable salad, each boulette likely weighs between 25 and 30 grams. Multiplying by 10 gives a weight range of 250 to 300 grams. Considering possible minor hidden volume underneath the top layer and sauce weight adhering to the boulettes, a reasonable estimate is about 275 grams for the total weight of the 10 boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate shown."

The image shows a round white plate divided visually into three portions: cooked rotini pasta on the left, a small dollop of white crème fraîche in the center, and a reddish chili mixture with visible large chunks of cervelas sausage and red kidney beans on the right. The chili covers approximately one-third of the plate's surface area. The cervelas pieces are cut into roughly uniform cubes about 2-3 cm each, with visible kidney beans interspersed in a thick sauce. The depth of the chili portion appears to be about 1.5 to 2 cm, considering the height relative to the pasta on the same plate. The plate is a standard dinner plate size (approx. 25 cm diameter) which helps gauge volume. Given the density of the chili (meat, beans, and thick sauce), it is relatively heavy per volume. Estimating the chili volume to be around 200-250 ml or grams in weight equivalents, while accounting for the density of cooked beans and meat, the weight should fall near 230 grams. There is no visible hidden layer underneath, so no additional volume is added. Therefore, based purely on visual evidence and density considerations, the estimated weight of the chili is approximately 230 grams."

The image shows a bowl with two distinct portions: white rice on the left and dalh de lentilles corail on the right. The target food is 'riz' (rice). The rice occupies roughly half the bowl horizontally and appears to be cooked and fluffy, with visible grains. The bowl is a standard size roughly 15 cm in diameter, and the depth of the rice layer appears to be about 3-4 cm, judging by the curvature and the spoon depth. The rice fills the bowl to nearly the same level as the dalh, indicating a full portion. Cooked white rice has an approximate density of about 130-150 grams per cup (about 240 ml volume). Given the volume visible is about 1 cup or slightly more, the portion of rice likely weighs around 150 grams. No visible container weight is included and the consistency is typical for cooked white rice portions in such bowls."

The image shows a single whole pear ('poire') being held in a hand. The pear is elongated with a narrow top and wider base. Compared to the person's fingers and hand size holding it, the pear appears to be moderately sized — about the length of an average hand (roughly 12-14 cm). The width at the base is approximately 5-6 cm. Pears have a dense, juicy texture. A typical medium pear weighs around 150 to 180 grams. Given the visual size relative to the hand and the typical density of a pear, this one is likely near the average side in weight. I estimate the weight at about 165 grams for this pear."

The target food items are 'salade de pâtes, cornichon, fromage, tomate'. In the image, the 'salade de pâtes' is visible as a small mound of elbow macaroni pasta mixed with small pieces of cornichons (gherkins) and some herbs or sauce. The portion is about the size of a small handful on the plate, occupying roughly 1/6th of the plate's surface area. The pasta is dense and compact, while the cornichon pieces are small and embedded in the salad. For 'cornichon', individual small slices are visible inside the pasta salad, and also possibly in the rice salad, but since only the pasta salad explicitly includes visible cornichon pieces, I focus on those. The visible cornichon pieces are small, about 0.5-1 cm each, totaling roughly 10-15 grams dispersed in the pasta salad. 'Fromage' (cheese) is not clearly visible as solid pieces on the plate; there might be small bits mixed in the salads but not clearly distinct. Given the input, I focus on visible cheese, which appears to be a minor portion, estimated visually about 10 grams since there are no distinct lumps. For 'tomate', there is one small whole cherry tomato on a skewer, visually about 15 grams, consistent with average cherry tomato weights. Summarizing quantities based on visual volume and density: 'salade de pâtes' including cornichon pieces is approximately 90 grams, cornichon component within that about 10-15 grams, tomato about 15 grams, and fromage about 10 grams. Since the question groups these foods, my best estimate for combined weight of 'salade de pâtes, cornichon, fromage, tomate' focuses on the whole unit present on the plate. The largest item is the pasta salad with embedded cornichons, cherry tomato is a separate visible item, and cheese is minor and likely blended in small quantity. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of these four combined foods as approximately 115 grams, broken down roughly as 90 grams pasta salad (including cornichon), 15 grams tomato, and 10 grams fromage. This reflects the actual visible portion sizes and density without including container or other sauces separately."

The waffle occupies a central area of the plate. The waffle appears to be about 12 cm long and 8 cm wide based on comparison to the plate size. The thickness of the waffle is about 1.5 to 2 cm judging from the visible side edges. The waffle is dense but also porous, characteristic of typical waffles. There is apple compote on top, but the target is only the waffle, so I exclude the compote weight. Considering the waffle's size and known densities for homemade or standard waffles, including minimal moisture content, I estimate the waffle's weight to be between 70 and 90 grams. Taking the midpoint for an accurate estimate, I conclude the waffle weighs approximately 80 grams."

The target food item is 'salade de céleri,' which is the grated white salad located at the bottom right of the plate. It appears as a small, loosely piled mound of finely shredded white celery root mixed with a light dressing. The salad occupies roughly 1/6 of the plate’s surface area, and the pile is approximately 2-3 cm high. Comparing it with the roasted chicken pieces (center left), which show a typical thickness and familiar forms, and the carrot salad (top right) which has a visually larger volume, the celery salad is the smallest of the three salads. The celery pieces appear finely shredded, which reduces density but the creamy dressing adds weight. The visible portion looks to be about a small side serving. Given the density of celery root and its water content, along with the dressing, a typical portion of this visible size would weigh about 70 to 90 grams. To be precise and conservative based on visual evidence, I estimate the weight at approximately 80 grams."

The image shows a translucent blue bowl held by a hand, with a creamy light yellow substance spread inside the bottom of the bowl. This is identified as crème caramel, appearing partially filling the shallow bottom of the bowl. The bowl's diameter can be visually approximated by comparing it to the size of the fingers holding it, assuming an adult hand with fingers about 1.5-2 cm wide. The crème caramel layer looks uneven but roughly occupies a circle about 8-10 cm in diameter and an estimated average thickness of about 1.5-2 cm, slightly heaped in the center. The volume corresponds to a pudding-like creamy texture with medium density, so its weight is roughly equivalent to its volume in milliliters (assuming slightly denser than water). Estimating volume: circle area (π * r^2) with r ~4 cm is 50 cm^2 multiplied by 1.5 cm depth = ~75 cm^3 or grams. Given the density slightly above water due to cream and sugar, I raise this to about 85 grams total. Therefore, the estimated weight of the crème caramel in the bowl is around 85 grams."

The image shows four quarter pieces of a sweet potato waffle ('gaufre à la patate douce') arranged on a round plate. Each quarter is approximately a rectangular shape about 7 cm long, 5 cm wide, and roughly 1.5 cm thick, based on comparing to the visible plate size and texture. The waffles appear cooked with a dense, slightly moist interior typical of sweet potato batter. There is a layer of white sauce and a slice of smoked salmon on top but these are not included in this estimation since the target is only the sweet potato waffle. The waffles have a grid texture typical of waffles, which suggests some air pockets but mostly dense structure. Considering density slightly less than dense bread but more than airy waffle due to sweet potato flour and moisture, an estimated density is about 0.5-0.6 g/cm³. Each quarter would therefore weigh approximately 7 * 5 * 1.5 = 52.5 cm³ volume, multiplied by 0.55 g/cm³ density gives ~29 grams per quarter. Four quarters total about 116 grams. Given some conservative margin for moisture and batter thickness variation, the total weighs around 110-120 grams. I therefore estimate the total weight of the sweet potato waffle in the image to be approximately 115 grams."

Visually, the courgette (zucchini) pieces are cut into slices roughly 2-3 cm wide and mixed with translucent cooked onion slices. The food occupies approximately half of the container's base area and is roughly 2 to 3 cm deep. In dimension comparison, the container appears to be a small to medium sized glass lunch box, approximately 15 cm by 15 cm, indicated by the width of the food relative to the container and visible edges. The courgette and onions are cooked, so they have a wet, slightly reduced volume compared to raw. Density-wise, courgette is fairly water-rich and light but onions add moderate density; combined, this is a moderately dense cooked vegetable mix. Considering the approximate volume (about half of a 15x15x3 cm space = ~338 cm3) and average cooked vegetable density (~0.8 g/cm3), the estimated weight is roughly 270 grams. This estimation includes visible mixed volume without counting any hidden extra food, consistent with the visual evidence."

The cheese block has a dense texture typical of Gruyère, making its density relatively high. Gruyère cheese density is approximately 1.1 g/cm³. Calculating the volume as 12 cm × 2.5 cm × 1.5 cm = 45 cubic centimeters, the estimated weight is 45 × 1.1 = 49.5 grams.

The mozzarella portion takes up about one quarter of the plate's surface area. The plate size can be roughly approximated by comparing with the olives next to it, which have an average size around 2-3 cm each. The mozzarella ball appears about 8-9 cm in diameter and roughly 2-3 cm in height/thickness, indicating a plump and dense cheese portion. Considering mozzarella's typical density (about 0.9 g/cm³), and calculating a rough volume of a flattened sphere or dome shape, the estimated weight is approximately 100 grams.

It appears to be about 3.5 cm in diameter in the middle section. The banana is not sliced further; it is a whole segment of the banana without the peel. The density of banana is relatively high for a fruit, as it is dense and moist inside. Given the length, diameter, and typical density, the weight is estimated as a typical small-to-medium banana segment, roughly a third of a whole banana. Whole bananas generally weigh around 120-150 grams including peel; peeled banana weight is typically about 80% of that.

The total volume of the avocado here is roughly 2 slices × (8 cm × 3 cm × 1.5 cm) = 72 cubic cm. The density of avocado is about 0.96 g/cm³, so the estimated weight is approximately 69 grams. Considering slight variations in slice thickness and the possibility of some flesh missing at edges, I adjust slightly down to 65 grams for this portion of avocado."

The image shows two slices of whole wheat or multigrain toast on a white plate. Each slice has a visible thickness of approximately 1.5 cm. The toast size corresponds roughly to a standard square slice of bread, about 10 cm by 10 cm. The toast appears toasted but not overly thick or thin. Given the texture and density of toasted bread, a single slice of this type typically weighs around 30-35 grams. Both pieces together might weigh about 60-70 grams, but since the target is just 'toast', which likely refers to the bread itself, I will focus on one slice. Since the toast appears evenly toasted and normal size, I estimate the weight of one slice of toast at approximately 32 grams."

The target food is 'houmous au basilic (acheté)' shown in a small glass placed above the plate. Visually, the glass is about two-thirds filled with houmous. The volume of houmous appears to be roughly equivalent to a small serving spoon portion, approximately 3-4 cm in height within the glass, which looks like a typical small tumbler glass about 6-7 cm tall with a 5-6 cm diameter. Based on these dimensions and typical consistency of hummus, which is dense and creamy, the amount corresponds visually to about 50-60 grams. Given the partial filling and the dense nature of hummus, the estimate is on the conservative side but realistic for a small side serving."

The target food item is 'porc', which in the image is located at the bottom left corner. It is a single cooked pork piece partially covered with a white creamy mustard sauce. Visually, it is about 8 cm long, 6 cm wide, and approximately 1.5 cm thick based on relative size compared to the aubergine slices and the container. The pork looks cooked and dense. Considering meat density and visible thickness, the piece is relatively compact. Pork meat density is roughly 1.0 g/cm³, so estimating volume as length × width × thickness = 8 × 6 × 1.5 = 72 cm³, equates to approximately 72 grams. The sauce on top adds a little weight but is not part of the pork itself, so excluded. Therefore, the weight of the porc alone is estimated at about 72 grams, with a small margin for variance due to irregular shape and possible slight hidden thickness."

The image shows a white plate with a serving of mashed potatoes ('purée de pdt'), pieces of stewed meat ('viande ragoût'), two whole cooked carrots, and a substantial amount of brown gravy sauce spread over and around the food. The sauce covers nearly the entire base of the plate's food area, appearing as a thin to moderately thick layer across an estimated diameter of about 15 cm on the plate's surface. Comparing the sauce layer to the size of the visible meat and carrots, the sauce depth is roughly estimated to be 2-3 millimeters on average, with slight pooling around edges increasing depth locally but not significantly contributing to total weight. The plate diameter is approximately 25 cm, and the sauce covers about 60% of the plate's inner surface area. Considering the sauce density approximates water-based gravies at about 1 g/ml, and estimating the total volume of the sauce to be roughly equivalent to a flat cylinder 15 cm diameter and 0.2 cm thick, this volume is approximately 35 ml, which corresponds roughly to 35 grams. Given pooling sauce around edges, I add approximately 10%-15% extra, totaling about 40 grams of sauce visible on the plate. No container weight is included. Therefore, the weight estimate for the sauce alone in this serving is around 40 grams."

The target food item is 'fromage', which is visible on the right slice of pain bis. There are seven thin rectangular slices of cheese laid side by side, covering most of the bread slice surface. Each slice appears to be about 1.5 cm wide, approximately 7-8 cm long (matching the bread length), and about 2-3 mm thick. The cheese is semi-hard, likely typical Swiss or similar type, with a density around 1 g/cm³. Estimating each slice volume as 7 cm × 1.5 cm × 0.25 cm = 2.625 cm³. For 7 slices, total volume is approximately 18.4 cm³, which by density corresponds roughly to 18-19 grams. Considering some variation in slice thickness and overlap, I estimate the total weight of the fromage at about 20 grams."

The target food item is 'oeuf', which is located in the lower left part of the plate. It appears scrambled and occupies a roughly rectangular area about 7 cm by 4 cm based on comparison with the quartered avocado pieces nearby and the visible wrap. The thickness of the scrambled egg is estimated around 1 cm, a typical thickness for cooked scrambled egg without excessive fluffiness. The scrambled egg is not piled too high, so the visible volume is close to the total volume. Considering that cooked scrambled eggs are dense but contain some air, the density is moderate at about 0.7 g/cm³. Multiplying the approximate dimensions: 7 cm x 4 cm x 1 cm = 28 cm³ volume, and applying the density gives around 20 grams. Therefore, the estimated weight of the scrambled egg portion visible is approximately 20 grams."

The image shows one croissant au chocolat held in a person's left hand. The croissant measures approximately the length of the palm, estimated visually to be around 12 cm long and roughly 6-7 cm wide at its widest part. The thickness appears moderate—a typical croissant shape—with noticeable flakiness and some sprinkled bits on top that slightly add weight. The bottom edge is partially bitten, revealing a thin layer of chocolate filling inside. Considering the visible dimensions and typical density of a chocolate croissant, which has layers of buttery dough and chocolate, this single piece appears to be a standard size rather than oversized or mini. Comparing it to the hand size confirms a heavier weight than a basic plain croissant due to the chocolate filling. Standard croissants usually weigh between 50-70 grams, and with chocolate, the weight is slightly higher. I estimate this croissant au chocolat to be around 65 grams based on the actual dimensions and visual volume."

The image shows a transparent glass bowl containing chocolate yogurt, which is the target food item. The yogurt fills roughly about half or slightly more of the bowl's volume. The bowl appears to be a small dessert or snack-sized glass bowl. Comparing the bowl to the visible table texture and common bowl sizes, I estimate the bowl's diameter to be approximately 10-12 cm. The yogurt has a soft, slightly heaped texture with some peaks, suggesting a volume of about 150-180 ml. Given yogurt's density close to that of water (approximately 1 g/ml), the weight of the yogurt is roughly equivalent to its volume in grams. Therefore, the chocolate yogurt portion shown is approximately 160 grams, considering the slight heaping and consistency."

The image shows a rectangular plastic container with a salad that contains diced cucumbers, tomatoes, yellow bell peppers, black olives, chopped white cheese (likely feta), and some rings of onions. The salad appears to fill about 70-80% of the container's volume. Comparing the container size to the visible tabletop edges suggests the container is a medium-sized food storage box, approximately 15 cm long, 10 cm wide, and about 7 cm deep. The salad pieces are small and diced, with some cheese crumbles dispersed throughout. Assuming a typical density for mixed salad with vegetables, olives, and feta cheese, the salad is denser than leafy greens alone but lighter than cooked or processed vegetable dishes. Given the visible volume and composition, the salad likely weighs around 300 grams, accounting for the diced vegetables’ water content and cheese density. No sauce weight is included as the target is only the 'salade grecque.'"

The target food item to estimate is 'caviar d'aubergine'. Visually, it corresponds to the spread on the upper slice of bread on the plate. The slice of bread itself looks like a typical seeded country-style bread slice, approximately 10 cm long and 6-7 cm wide. The spread of caviar d'aubergine covers the entire slice fairly thinly, with an estimated spread thickness of about 3-4 mm. Given the spread covers roughly a 60-70 cm2 surface area (bread slice size), the volume of spread can be estimated around 18-28 cm3. Considering the density of caviar d'aubergine (a cooked, pureed vegetable spread which is somewhat dense but with moisture), around 0.9-1 g/cm3 is plausible. Therefore, the weight of the caviar d'aubergine spread on the bread is estimated around 20-25 grams. Taking a precise visual estimation and density into account, I estimate the weight of the 'caviar d'aubergine' portion as 23 grams."

The target food item is 'tomate'. Looking closely at the image, the tomato appears on the left side of the container as red chunks or slices. There are about 2-3 visible pieces of tomato, some partially hidden beneath avocado slices and tofu cubes. The tomato pieces are roughly 4-5 cm long and 2-3 cm wide with a typical tomato flesh thickness of about 1-1.5 cm visible. The tomato pieces appear fresh and moist, and the density of raw tomato is relatively low as it contains mostly water. Comparing the tomato pieces to the other food items and the overall container size, the total visible volume corresponds to roughly a small portion, approximately the size of half or a third of a medium tomato. Given typical raw tomato weight and this visual volume, I estimate the weight of the tomato pieces to be in the range of 50-70 grams. Considering slight hidden volume and the pieces' thickness, I estimate 60 grams for the tomato serving in this container."

The image shows a single slice of tarte aux fraises (strawberry tart) on a patterned ceramic plate. The tart slice appears to be about one sixth of a whole tart, judging by the crust edge and the typical wedge shape. There are seven visible strawberries cut in halves and placed on top, along with some smaller red currants embedded in the creamy filling. The crust is thin and crumbly with fragments on the plate. The cream filling looks dense but aerated, occupying the space between crust and strawberries. By comparing the tart slice size to the average dessert plate diameter (around 22 cm), the slice is roughly 10 cm long and 5 cm wide at its broadest end. The slice's height is approximately 3.5 cm, considering the berries' height and the filling. The density combines the crumbly crust, creamy filling, and fresh fruit. Given strawberries are about 0.6 g/cm3 (dense for fruit) and cream plus crust raise overall slice density to roughly 0.9 g/cm3. Calculating an estimated volume: length x width x height = 10 x 5 x 3.5 = 175 cm3. Multiplying volume by estimated density: 175 x 0.9 = 157.5 g. Considering some air pockets and possible overestimation, I adjust down slightly to account for crumb loss and air in cream, resulting in a final weight estimate of approximately 150 grams for this slice."

The target food item is 'vinaigre,' which appears visually as a drizzle or dressing on top of the chopped vegetables (tomato, carrot, cucumber) and pumpkin seeds in the bowl. Observing the image, the vinaigre is a light mustard seed vinaigrette scattered evenly but thinly across the salad surface. The volume of the vinaigre is minimal and it is not pooled or in a separate container. Given the thin distribution and typical usage of vinaigre as a dressing, it likely weighs between 5 and 10 grams. Since the drizzle is modest but covers a good portion of the salad, I estimate the vinaigre weight closer to 7 grams."

The sauce oignons is visible as a layer of reddish-brown onion sauce spread on top of the slices of rôti (roast meat). It appears mostly concentrated on the two visible meat slices, covering an area roughly equivalent to the meat surface. The sauce layer thickness seems thin, about 2-3 millimeters judging by the slight pooling and edges visible on the plate. The amount covers a surface area of approximately 12 cm by 7 cm over two meat slices, and there is no separate container or pile of sauce. Considering onion sauces tend to be moderately dense (mostly liquid with cooked onions), the volume would be roughly 12 cm x 7 cm x 0.2 cm = about 16.8 cm³ or milliliters. Using a density close to 1 g/ml for sauce, this corresponds to approximately 17 grams. I therefore estimate the weight of the sauce oignons on the plate to be about 17 grams."

Visually, it fills about half of the medium-sized bowl, with its surface showing a thick, dense texture with visible lentils and carrot slices. The spoon provides a scale reference, indicating the bowl's diameter is roughly 15 cm. The dalh appears to be around 4-5 cm deep in the bowl. Considering the density of cooked lentils and vegetables in a thick stew, the volume approximates about 250 ml, with a dense food density around 1 g/ml. This suggests a weight near 250 grams. Given some allowance for space and the visible thickness, I estimate the dalh de lentilles corail to weigh approximately 260 grams."

The image shows a single slice of toasted bread (tartine) on a white plate. The slice appears to be relatively small, roughly 8-9 cm in length and about 5-6 cm at its widest. The bread slice is thin, with a toasted edge and a somewhat dense crumb. On top, there is a spread of chestnut cream (crème de marrons) and butter. The chestnut cream is applied unevenly but covers most of the surface, with butter visible underneath and slightly melted. The thickness of the spread combined (butter + chestnut cream) appears moderate, approximately 3-4 mm in depth. Toasted bread density is lighter than fresh bread but still notable, with a typical thin slice of this size weighing around 20-25 grams. The chestnut cream is dense and sticky, while the butter adds density but in a thin layer. The spread likely weighs about 15 grams combined considering the visible amount and density. Adding these together, the total weight of the tartine with spread should be in the range of 35-40 grams. Accounting for some crumbs and variations, I estimate around 37 grams total for this tartine with crème de marrons and butter."

The target food is 'mais' (corn). In the image, the corn is located near the bottom center of the plate, composed of individual kernels forming a small cluster. There appear to be roughly 40-50 kernels visible. The kernels are loose, and the pile is shallow, approximately 1-1.5 cm deep, covering an area roughly 6cm by 4cm on the plate. The plate is a standard size (estimated about 25 cm diameter), and the kernels are typical size for corn, around 1 cm each. Corn kernels are dense and moist, and the compact pile suggests a modest portion size. Considering density and actual visible volume, the weight is likely in the range of 60-80 grams. Visually, the portion fits closer to 70 grams for this serving."

The target food item is 'graines de courge' (pumpkin seeds). In the image, the pumpkin seeds are visible scattered throughout the couscous mixture inside a rectangular glass container. The seeds are relatively small, flat, dark green pieces, fewer in number compared to other components like couscous and cucumber chunks. Based on the container size (typical glass food storage container about 15 cm wide), the seeds cover only a thin scattered layer across the surface and within the mix, likely totaling a small volume fraction. Considering their small size and sparse distribution, there appears to be roughly a teaspoon or slightly more of pumpkin seeds, which by density (about 0.7g per teaspoon) corresponds to around 4 to 6 grams. Accounting for some seeds mixed inside unseen from the angle, I estimate approximately 5 grams of pumpkin seeds in this portion."

The lemon slice thickness is visible and appears to be about 0.5 cm. The slice includes the peel, pulp, and membranes. Considering the density of a lemon slice (high water content, moderate density), I relate this to an average lemon slice weight. Given the dimensions and the single slice visible, the weight should be close to 6-8 grams. Factoring in the thickness and density, I estimate the lemon slice to weigh approximately 7 grams."

The image shows one small feuilleté with tomato sauce visible on the surface. The feuilleté is placed on a wooden surface with no direct references like utensils or hands, but the wood grain and texture give a modest scale. The feuilleté appears to be roughly the size of a small bite-sized appetizer, estimated around 3.5 cm in length, 2.5 cm in width, and about 2.5 cm thick, based on its puffed and layered pastry structure. The puff pastry dough is visibly flaky and light but with some density due to the tomato sauce filling. Tomato sauce adds some small extra weight but is not bulky here, mainly a thin layer between pastry layers. Considering the typical density of puff pastry (around 0.5-0.7 g/cm3) and the sauce, the estimated volume is roughly 3.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 = approximately 22 cm3. Multiplying by an average density of 0.6 g/cm3 gives an estimated weight of about 13 grams. Given slight variations due to puffiness and possible minor charring reducing mass slightly, the final estimate is conservatively 12 grams."

The cookie is round but not perfectly uniform, with a visible thickness suggesting it is somewhat dense and chewy rather than very thin and crisp. There are several visible chocolate chunks embedded within the cookie. Comparing the cookie size to the texture of the granite, which gives a rough scale reference, the cookie diameter appears to be roughly 7-8 cm. The thickness is approximately 1.5-2 cm. Considering cookies of this size and visible density, which includes the chocolate pieces that add weight, such cookies typically range in weight from 40g to 60g. Given the substantial thickness and visible dense texture, I estimate the cookie weighs towards the higher end, approximately 55 grams."

There are clearly two small cheese pieces: one larger, roundish portion with some rind, and another smaller wedge-shaped white piece. Both pieces have a creamy, dense appearance typical of sheep/goat cheese. Comparing these pieces to the baguette slice and the piece of fish, the combined volume of the two cheese pieces is roughly equivalent to a small handful, likely around 3-4 cubic centimeters per piece, totaling about 7-8 cubic centimeters for both pieces combined. Given the density typical of soft sheep/goat cheeses is close to 1.0 g/cm³, the total estimated weight is approximately 7 to 8 grams. Considering small margin for moisture and rind weight, I estimate the total weight of these two cheese pieces at 8 grams."

The target food is 'yogourt nature,' which in the image appears as a white, creamy layer spread on a single slice of pain complet (whole grain bread) on a plate. The bread slice is approximately 10 cm in length and 6-7 cm in width based on standard slice sizes and relative scale to the plate. The yogurt layer covers most of the slice with a spread thickness estimated visually at about 3-5 mm, as it is relatively thin but clearly spread without pooling. Considering yogurt's density close to water (approximately 1 g/cm3), the volume can be approximated by length × width × thickness: around 10 cm × 7 cm × 0.4 cm = 28 cm3. This suggests roughly 28 grams; adjusting slightly for spread irregularities and minor thinner edges, the weight is likely close to 25-30 grams. Therefore, the reasonable estimate for the visible yogurt nature portion is 27 grams."

The image displays a single peeled carrot lying flat on a granite or speckled stone countertop. There are no other objects directly next to or overlapping the carrot for direct size comparison, but the texture of the countertop tiles and the reflection gives a sense that the carrot is of moderate size, at least 12-15 cm long. The carrot is tapered, thicker at one end and thinner at the other, with a consistent cylindrical shape. The density of a carrot is moderately high as it is a root vegetable, so volume corresponds fairly closely to weight. Given its approximate length and visible girth, the carrot appears to be a typical medium-sized peeled carrot. Based on visual estimation, typical medium carrots weigh between 70-100 grams. Considering all above, I estimate this peeled carrot weighs approximately 85 grams."

The target food item is 'purée cacahuète' (peanut butter). In the image, the peanut butter is visible as a light brown creamy dollop located on the lower left side of the plate. It appears to be a single, smooth portion, not spread thinly but modestly heaped. Comparing its size to the half banana on the top right of the plate and the chocolate chips on the upper left, the peanut butter portion seems roughly 4-5 cm wide and 2-3 cm thick with a moderately dense consistency typical of creamy peanut butter. Given the visual comparison to the other items and typical density of peanut butter (approximately 0.9-1.0 g/cm³), the volume likely corresponds to about 15-20 grams. Considering visual evidence alone and avoiding assumptions beyond what is seen, the estimated weight of the peanut butter portion is about 18 grams."

The target food item is 'yaourt nature'. In the image, there is a single open container of natural yogurt visible on the left, alongside an apple. The yogurt container is cylindrical and filled to the top with creamy, smooth yogurt. The container is a standard small-sized yogurt pot typically around 125 grams capacity based on its comparison with the adjacent apple. The apple, slightly smaller than a typical medium apple, provides a size reference—standard yogurt pots of this shape and dimension are commonly about 120 to 150 grams volumetrically. Given the yogurt is dense but not overly heavy, and the pot is about this typical portion size, the yogurt weight is likely around 125 grams."

The image shows a single slice of brown bread ('pain') on a patterned plate with a visible tablespoon partially in the frame for scale. The bread slice is irregularly shaped, roughly oval, approximately 12 cm long and about 8 cm wide. The slice is moderately thick, around 1.5 cm, with a light crumb texture and visible air pockets consistent with whole grain or rustic bread. The bread appears dense but not overly heavy, based on surface texture and crumb density. Comparing to the spoon nearby (around 14 cm long) confirms these dimensions. Given typical density for whole grain bread slices, and the dimensions observed, a single slice of this size and thickness usually weighs about 40-50 grams. Considering the visible thickness and density, I estimate the weight of this piece of bread ('pain') to be approximately 45 grams."

The target food item is mayonnaise, visible spread thinly but evenly on one slice of pain bis (brown bread). The slice of bread is roughly palm-sized, about 12 cm long and 6 cm wide, giving around 72 cm² surface area covered by mayonnaise. The spread layer is thin, approximately 1-2 mm thick, judging by visible texture and coverage extent. Mayonnaise is a dense, creamy substance with a density close to 0.9 g/cm³. Multiplying area by estimated thickness gives approximately 7.2 to 14.4 cm³ volume, which corresponds roughly to 7 to 13 grams in weight. Considering the thin spread and some uneven parts, the weight estimate should be on the lower side within this range. Therefore, I estimate the mayonnaise portion weight at about 8 grams."

The image shows a black bowl containing several food items, including porridge, raspberries (framboises), blueberries (myrtilles), dark chocolate chips, and peanut butter. The target food item to estimate is 'myrtilles', or blueberries. Focusing on the blueberries, I count approximately 11 individual blueberries visible, clustered mostly on the left side of the bowl. The blueberries vary slightly in size but appear roughly uniform overall. The blueberries have a typical round shape and the visible individual fruits seem similar in size to a standard blueberry, approximately 1.5 to 2 cm in diameter. Using the bowl as a size reference, the blueberries cover an area roughly 6 to 8 cm in diameter if laid side by side, and a single layer is visible with little overlap, indicating no hidden depth beneath. As blueberries are dense and solid fruit, their density is relatively high, about 0.7 to 0.9 g/cm3. Each blueberry typically weighs around 1.5 to 2 grams. With about 11 blueberries seen, the total is approximately 16 to 22 grams. Considering minor quantity that might be just missed at edges and variation in size, I estimate the total weight of blueberries in this serving to be about 18 grams."

The tuna pieces appear scattered evenly but in limited quantity relative to couscous. Counting visible tuna chunks, I estimate around 10-12 distinct sizeable pieces, each about 2-3 cm long and roughly 0.5-1 cm thick. Given the light flaky density of canned tuna in chunks, each piece likely weighs about 8-10 grams. The total volume occupied by tuna is about 15-20% of the whole container filling. Considering visual volume and density of cooked tuna, my internal weight estimate range is 80-110 grams. After considering no visible excess liquid or compactness, I estimate the tuna weight to be approximately 95 grams."

The target food item is ""yogourt orange sanguine,"" which appears to be the yogurt mixture seen in the bowl. The bowl contains a mixture of cereals, blueberries, and yogurt, which is the orange sanguine flavored yogurt. We see that the yogurt is mixed uniformly with the cereals and blueberries, not as a separate layer, so we need to estimate the total yogurt quantity within the mixture. The bowl is a medium-sized ceramic bowl, approximately 16 cm in diameter, filled to about 80% of its height with the mixture. The yogurt, being the binding liquid, likely constitutes about 50% of the visible volume considering the cereals and blueberries take up space. Assuming the total volume of the mixture is roughly 300-350 mL based on bowl size and fill level, the yogurt volume would be approximately 150-175 mL. Yogurt density is close to that of water, about 1 g/mL, so the weight of the yogurt should be close to the volume estimate. Given the evidence, I estimate the weight of the ""yogourt orange sanguine"" in the bowl to be approximately 165 grams."

Comparing their size relative to the fingers, each cashew is approximately 2.5 to 3 cm long and seems fairly dense. The average weight of a single cashew nut is about 1.3 to 1.5 grams. Multiplying 18 cashews by an average weight of 1.4 grams results in about 25 grams. Considering some slight variation in size and density, the total weight is likely between 22 and 28 grams.

Focusing on the mayonnaise, I observe one distinct dollop with a roughly oval shape and a thickness similar to a typical spoonful. Comparing to the asparagus pieces, which are about 10-12 cm long, the mayonnaise dollop measures approximately 5 cm in length, 3 cm in width, and about 2 cm in visible thickness. Mayonnaise has a high density and creamy texture. Estimating volume as roughly 5 cm x 3 cm x 2 cm = 30 cubic centimeters (ml), and knowing that mayonnaise density is about 0.9 g/ml, the weight is approximately 27 grams.

Comparing the piece to the texture and small crumbs around it, the thickness appears to be about 0.8 to 1 cm. Its length is approximately 3 to 4 cm and width around 2 to 2.5 cm. Considering dark chocolate is dense with a typical density around 1.3 g/cm³, the estimated volume is roughly 12 cm³ (3.5 cm × 2 cm × 1.7 cm - factoring the angled top surface). Multiplying volume by density gives about 15 grams. Given potential slight air gaps and break irregularity, a conservative estimate for this single chocolate piece is around 14 grams."

Comparing the egg half to the size of the rice grains and cherry tomatoes nearby, the egg half appears to be a typical size, approximately half of a medium-sized hard-boiled egg. A whole medium hard-boiled egg typically weighs around 50 grams. Since this is one half, the weight should logically be around 25 grams. Given the visual evidence and no partial missing pieces, I estimate the weight of the 'oeuf' (half egg) on the plate to be approximately 25 grams."

It appears to be a single whole egg with a visible yolk and egg white spread thinly around it. The egg white extends approximately 9-10 cm in width and 8 cm in height based on relative size to the plate and other items (cherry tomatoes around 3-4 cm in length). The thickness of the cooked egg white appears thin, approximately 0.2 to 0.3 cm, while the yolk maintains a small dome shape implying some volume and density. Fried eggs typically have a density close to that of cooked eggs, and a single egg generally weighs between 50 and 60 grams. Given the size and appearance of this egg, it looks like an average large egg fried without extra added volume. Therefore, considering visual evidence and typical densities, I estimate the weight of the 'oeuf au plat' on the plate to be approximately 55 grams."

Using the textured background, which resembles a typical table or placemat, I estimate each bunny's height is about 4 to 5 cm, width about 2 to 3 cm, and depth similar to the width due to the rounded shape. Considering typical density of solid milk chocolate (about 1.2 g/cm³) and estimating the volume as roughly equivalent to a rectangular prism of around 4.5 cm x 3 cm x 2.5 cm equals about 33.75 cm³, adjusting for the rounded shape to about 70% of that (approx 24 cm³).

The milk fills about half the bowl. Compared to the spoon at the top right, each cluster is roughly 2-3 cm in length and thickness appears to be about 1-1.5 cm as these clusters are puffed but dense. Cereal density is moderate due to grains and chocolate pieces included. Estimating individual cluster weight at about 3-4 grams and considering approximately 15-20 clusters visible plus some smaller fragments, a total weight between 55-70 grams is reasonable. Milk is excluded as per instructions. Therefore, based purely on visual evidence, the estimated weight of the cereals in the bowl is about 62 grams."

The slices are somewhat thin but dense and solid, each about 4-5 cm long and around 2-3 cm wide, with thickness visually around 0.3-0.5 cm. Given the density of these cheeses (semi-hard to hard cheeses), typical densities range around 1.1 g/cm³. The total visible cheese area and thickness suggest a combined volume roughly equivalent to about 30-40 cm³. Multiplying the estimated volume by density suggests a total weight around 35-45 grams.

Comparing the bottle size to typical glass bottles (around 15 cm tall and 6 cm diameter), the volume occupied by the peanuts is roughly around 50-60 ml. Given that peanuts have a density close to 0.6-0.7 g/ml, and considering some empty air spaces between the peanuts, the effective density should be a bit lower. Estimating based on volume and average peanut weight (~1 g per peanut), the total weight is likely around 30 to 40 grams.

The chopped pieces appear to be about 1 cm long each, and there are approximately 10-15 such pieces visible. Considering the thinness of these small pieces and the sparse distribution, the total onion portion on the plate is very small. Onion's density is moderate and moist but light in weight compared to volume. Given the visual evidence, the chopped green onion amounts approximately to 3-5 grams in total.

The bowl itself is a medium-sized dessert or breakfast bowl likely around 12 to 15 cm in diameter, providing visual scale relative to the granules. The muesli is dry and somewhat loose in texture, making it less dense than wet, compact foods such as the yogurt present underneath. Given the volume of the muesli layer and its lighter density compared to yogurt, the weight is less than the apparent volume might suggest. Based on these observations and typical densities of dry muesli, I estimate the visible portion to weigh approximately 50 grams."

The portion is a moderate pile, with roughly a stack about 6-7 cm wide and 8-10 cm long, and about 1.5-2 cm thick when considering the depth of noodles layered on top of each other. The pasta appears cooked and slightly glossy due to sauce or oil. Comparing to the plate size, which is a standard dinner plate of approximately 26-28 cm diameter, the pasta portion occupies about one quarter of the plate's surface area. The pasta is dense and cooked, so it will be heavier than it looks due to water absorption. Given these dimensions and the spread of the pasta pile, an estimated volume corresponds to roughly 120-150 grams. Considering the presence of sauce on top with mushrooms, but excluding that as it is a separate item, the pure pasta portion is estimated conservatively at about 140 grams, allowing for some depth under the visible top layer but no hidden additional portions.

Visually, the mushrooms in the sauce appear as about 9 medium-sized slices scattered throughout the pasta, with the creamy sauce coating visible on both mushrooms and pasta. The sauce itself is not visibly separated but coats the visible noodles and mushrooms. The creamy sauce layer thickness is thin, mainly a coating rather than a large quantity of liquid. The bowl is medium-sized, and about half of the bowl's content seems to be pasta, the rest likely comprises the sauce and mushrooms. Given the visual volume of the creamy mushroom sauce visible as coating and small pieces, I estimate its weight. A typical creamy mushroom sauce density is medium, thicker than water but not dense like solid food. Considering the size and amount of mushrooms and cream present, the sauce likely weighs in the range of 80-120 grams. Choosing a median value based on visible coverage and material density, I estimate the weight of the sauce aux champignons to be approximately 100 grams."

The statistics to consider: The volume of vinaigre balsamique appears moderate but not excessive; it covers parts of the surface irregularly in a few streaks and small pools, without filling the bowl or creating a large puddle. Compared to the dimension of the bowl (which is roughly 10 cm in diameter) and thickness of visible vinaigre balsamique drizzles, I estimate the volume is approximately 10-15 ml considering the uneven layer and small spots.

The thickness appears moderate, about 1-1.5 cm, given the visible edge profile and slight doming. The cookie looks dense, typical of a chocolate chunk cookie with sugar and butter content, which increases its density compared to a light cookie.

The bread piece is about 10 cm long and 4-5 cm wide, with the spread covering roughly 40-50 cm². The thickness of the cream layer appears thin to moderate, approximately 2-3 mm thick, judging by the texture and slight pooling on the surface. Crème de marrons is a dense, smooth spread similar in density to jam or thick purée, approximately 1 to 1.2 g/cm³. Estimating the volume involves multiplying surface area by thickness: 45 cm² × 0.25 cm = 11.25 cm³. Considering density about 1.1 g/cm³, weight = 11.25 × 1.1 ≈ 12.4 grams. Rounding conservatively, accounting for some unevenness in spreading and absorption into bread, the estimated weight of the chestnut cream is approximately 12 grams."
2ahgvr,graines de chia,8.0,8,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/aa859e5b-563f-472c-9914-036722ebf60e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is ""graines de chia"". In the image, the chia seeds appear mixed throughout a creamy, thick white mixture inside a white bowl. The chia seeds are small, black and widely dispersed, not in a solid form or concentrated pile. Visually, they form less than 10% of the total volume of the mixture. Given chia seeds' small size and relatively high density, their visual presence corresponds to a small weight compared to the other ingredients. The bowl looks medium-sized, with the mixture filling around 60-70% of it; however, the chia seeds are embedded and scattered, not in a thick layer. Estimating the chia seeds based on their dispersed amount in this mixture, I gauge the total weight of the chia seeds around 8 grams, reflecting a typical serving size mixed with other ingredients."
xjvrtk,tonic au gingembre,200.0,200,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/c70f93c3-23cc-4817-bbe9-93091771b273,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single glass bottle of ginger tonic water on a marble table. The bottle is clear with a green and white label indicating 'GINGER.' The bottle appears typical of small glass beverage bottles, similar in size to a standard 200 ml bottle, often used for specialty tonics or craft sodas. There is no visible liquid level difference, suggesting the bottle is either unopened or full. Using the bottle dimensions as a cue, it looks roughly 18 cm tall and about 5 cm in diameter, common for 200 ml glass bottled drinks. Since water's density is 1 g/ml and tonic water is close to that, the weight of the liquid inside would be approximately 200 grams. The glass bottle itself is excluded from estimation as per the instruction. Therefore, the estimated weight of the tonic au gingembre (ginger tonic) is about 200 grams."
xjvrtk,yogourt figue sans sucre,150.0,150,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/4c27b970-43cc-443a-93d5-6a8777362594,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single serving container of fig-flavored yogurt without added sugar, positioned on a wooden surface next to a fork. The container appears to be a small plastic cup with a label indicating 'Migros Bio' brand and fig flavor. The cup is approximately the height of an average fork's top end (visible to the right), which suggests a typical yogurt cup size. The cup is mostly full, with some yogurt visible at the top but no significant empty space. Given the container shape and size, and based on common single-serving yogurt cups, the volume is likely around 150 grams. Yogurt has a density close to water, so mass in grams usually corresponds to volume in milliliters, validating this estimate. Considering all visual cues and typical portion sizes for such products, the weight estimate for the 'yogourt figue sans sucre' is 150 grams."
