The specified food item is 'tomates cerises' (cherry tomatoes). Visually, there are approximately 16 cherry tomatoes in a small cardboard container. Each cherry tomato is roughly spherical with diameter about 2.5 to 3 cm. A typical cherry tomato weighs about 15 to 20 grams. Given these tomatoes appear firm and fresh, it's reasonable to use the average weight of around 17 grams per tomato. Multiplying 16 tomatoes by 17 grams gives about 272 grams total. Considering some tomatoes vary in size and there may be slight gaps, a plausible weight range is 250-290 grams. Choosing a midpoint value, the estimate is approximately 270 grams. This aligns with the visible size relative to the container and the light book nearby as a scale reference."

The target food is the pizza with mushrooms, olives, and courgettes on a white plate. The pizza is cut into four slices, and appears to be a medium-thin crust with typical toppings. The diameter of the whole pizza is roughly 22-24 cm based on the plate size and slice proportions. Cooked vegetables like mushrooms and courgettes add some moisture and weight but not excessively dense. Olives are small but denser and add some weight as well. The pizza is moderately topped but not heavily overloaded. A whole medium pizza of this type typically weighs around 300-400 grams. Since there are four slices present, the total pizza is about 350 grams estimate, so each slice is roughly 87 to 90 grams. The image shows portions consumed with some crust and toppings intact, and all four slices present. Therefore, the total weight of the pizza on the plate is about 350 grams, which represents the pizza as a whole food portion."

The specified food item is 'salade grecque,' which is visually identified in the plastic container. The size of the container is roughly medium, similar to a typical meal prep box commonly around 1 to 1.5 liters in volume. The salad consists of diced cucumbers, tomatoes, yellow bell peppers, olives, onions, and chunks of white cheese (likely feta), all coated with dressing. The salad fills approximately half to two-thirds of the container but is not densely packed; the diced pieces are relatively small and loosely aggregated. Considering the volume (around 700 mL effectively filled) and the density of mixed salad vegetables and cheese, the density is moderate (approx. ~0.7 g/mL due to vegetables and cheese). Multiplying volume by density yields an estimation range between 400g to 550g. Given some air gaps, visible salad distribution, and dressing, a mid-range estimate of about 475 grams is appropriate. This aligns well with typical prepared portions of Greek salad in similar containers, confirming plausibility."

First, I locate the légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux) on the plate; they are clearly visible as small pieces of cooked carrots and leeks on the right side next to the fish. The sautéed vegetables occupy a space roughly 7 cm long, 5 cm wide, and about 1.5 cm thick. This volume corresponds to approximately 52.5 cm³. Considering the density of cooked vegetables, which is approximately 0.7 to 0.9 g/cm³ due to water content and softness, the weight range would be around 37 to 47 grams. Given the visible quantity and considering some mixing with fish pieces, the final estimate near the midpoint would be 42 grams. This aligns well with the portion size on the plate, which is moderately sized but not dense or piled high."

The specified food item is 'colrave crue', which appears as peeled and sliced kohlrabi pieces on a small white plastic tray. The pieces are relatively thick and cover most of the tray's surface area. Given the typical size of such trays (approximately 15-18 cm long) and the fact that the kohlrabi slices are about 1-2 cm thick on average, we can estimate the volume. Kohlrabi has a density similar to other bulbous vegetables—somewhat dense and crunchy. The total volume of the slices looks similar to about one medium kohlrabi, which generally weighs around 200-300 grams. Considering some variability in thickness and size of the pieces, a plausible weight range is 220-280 grams, with a midpoint around 250 grams. This estimation fits the visible portion size and density well."

The food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries). They are clearly visible in a small bowl held by a hand, which provides a useful size reference. The bowl is relatively small, and the blueberries are densely packed to nearly the top. A typical blueberry weighs about 1 to 1.5 grams, and there appear to be around 50-60 berries in the bowl. Based on the bowl size and the blueberry count, the total weight likely falls between 50 and 90 grams. Choosing a midpoint near 70 grams is reasonable given visual volume and known average blueberry weights. This range is consistent with the visible portion size and density."
wrah5h,riz complet,82.0,200,118.0,1.1482140738103714,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/ee492174-b956-48fe-a4cb-4f059c9bc233,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'riz complet' (brown rice), which is located on the upper left side of the plate. Visually, the portion of rice covers about one-quarter of the plate's surface. The rice appears cooked and somewhat fluffy, with typical grain size and density for brown rice. Considering the plate’s diameter approximately matching a standard dinner plate (about 25-28 cm), the rice portion is roughly a compact mound about 1.5 to 2 cm thick. Rice density after cooking is about 130-140 g per 100 ml. Estimating the volume visually around 150 ml (length ~10 cm, width ~8 cm, height ~2 cm), the weight should range between about 195 g to 210 g. Given these observations and typical Swiss portion sizes, a plausible weight range is 180-220 grams, with a midpoint near 200 grams. This aligns well with the visible amount compared to other items on the plate and does not seem excessive or sparse."
xjvrtk,courgette et oignons,300.0,185,115.0,4.093983624065504,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'courgette et oignons', which is located on the left side of the glass container. The vegetables appear to be cooked and chopped into bite-sized pieces, spread loosely but visibly filling around half of the container's left side. The container is roughly 15 cm by 15 cm square. The vegetable portion does not look very dense, given the mix of courgettes and onions which have high water content and cook down to a soft texture, reducing volume and weight. Given the visible volume, depth (about 3-4 cm in the container), and typical density for cooked courgettes and onions, the weight could be estimated between 150 g and 220 g. A midpoint estimate around 185 g seems reasonable and plausible, considering the portion size and density observed. This also aligns well with the comparative size of the millet and bean patties on the right, which are denser but occupy a somewhat smaller visual volume. Therefore, the estimated weight for the courgette et oignons in this container is 185 grams."
ppf8hc,spaghetti,217.0,330,113.0,2.909813694078557,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/7c7d7932-0ffe-47e1-83e9-2289044511e5,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is spaghetti. The spaghetti is served on a medium-sized black plate, covering most of the plate surface, with a moderate pile height. Comparing the size of the spaghetti strands to the nozzle of the lighter in the background, the pile appears to be around 15 cm in diameter and about 3-4 cm high. Spaghetti cooked typically has a density around 0.7-1.0 g/cm3 due to water absorption. Estimating the volume: approximate a cylinder shape with roughly 15 cm diameter and 3.5 cm height. Volume = π * (7.5 cm)^2 * 3.5 cm ≈ 620 cm3. Using a density of 0.9 g/cm3 (middle ground), weight = 620 * 0.9 = 558 g. However, this seems high because the spaghetti is loosely piled and not densely packed. Considering the loose nature and air gaps, a more realistic effective density for the piled pasta on a plate might be lower, around 0.5-0.6 g/cm3. Recalculating with 0.55 g/cm3: 620 * 0.55 ≈ 341 g. Based on visual cues and common Swiss plate portion sizes, a cooked spaghetti serving around 300-350 g is quite reasonable. The minimum plausible weight might be about 280 g and the maximum about 370 g for the given volume and density context. Hence, the best estimate is near the midpoint: approximately 330 g. This aligns with the visible size and typical density of cooked spaghetti on a plate with pesto and some cheese."

The target food item is ""croissants au jambon,"" and the image shows two small croissants on the plate. These are classic croissants filled or topped with ham (visible by the slightly darker spots and shape). Each croissant appears to be about the size of a small palm, typical for a serving. In Switzerland, small ham croissants often weigh between 60-80 grams each due to the pastry and ham filling/density. Given there are two croissants, and considering their size relative to the knife and fork on the side as reference, the total weight for both combined should be approximately 130 to 160 grams. Choosing a midpoint estimate, a reasonable weight for the two croissants au jambon is about 145 grams. This fits the typical size and the visual cues without overestimating the density or volume."

The muesli nature is in a small terracotta bowl to the right of the white square bowl with yaourt nature. The muesli appears chunky and loosely packed, about three-quarters full in a small bowl roughly 10 cm in diameter and 5-6 cm deep. Given the loose structure and typical density of muesli granola clusters, the volume is approximately 250 to 300 ml. Considering an average density of around 0.5 to 0.6 grams per ml for chunky muesli, this yields a weight range of 125 to 180 grams. Selecting a value near the middle of this range for accuracy, I estimate the muesli weighs about 150 grams. This is consistent with the visual amount present and typical Swiss portion sizes."
wrah5h,"salade de carotte, mais, tomates",133.0,50,83.0,1.3099560935089594,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/a7f54de1-9b6e-4edf-8f1f-0df19f00ceb0,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'salade de carotte, mais, tomates', which is clearly visible on the top right of the plate. This salad consists of grated carrots, corn kernels, halved cherry tomatoes, and some leafy spinach or similar greens, mixed with a creamy dressing. The portion size is moderate, occupying roughly a quarter of the plate. Using the size of the two pizza slices as reference (each slice roughly 100-120 g), the salad mound looks less dense due to the grated carrot and vegetables, which have lower density and some air gaps. The salad appears to be around 8 cm wide and 5 cm deep in its spread, with an estimated thickness of about 1.5-2 cm. Considering the density of grated carrot salad mixed with dressing is roughly 0.6-0.8 g/cm³, the volume (8x5x1.8 cm ≈ 72 cm³) multiplied by density yields an estimated weight between 43 g (0.6*72) and 58 g (0.8*72). Taking the midpoint favors about 50 grams as a balanced estimate, which fits with the visual portion on the plate. This weight range also feels plausible compared to the pizza slices portion sizes. Thus, the estimated weight for the carrot, corn, and tomato salad is about 50 grams."

The target food is 'salade de tomates,' which corresponds to the sliced tomatoes on the plate. The plate is medium-sized with typical table utensils beside it to gauge scale. The tomato slices are thick and numerous, covering almost the whole plate surface with some overlapping but not piled high, suggesting a relatively flat layer about 1.5–2 cm thick. Considering a medium tomato weighs approximately 120–150 grams, and visually estimating about 3 to 4 medium tomatoes sliced and arranged here, the total quantity should be around 400 to 600 grams. Accounting for the density and moisture of tomatoes, which are quite dense and juicy, and the coverage on the plate, a plausible weight range is 450–550 grams. Selecting the midpoint gives a reliable estimate of approximately 500 grams for the tomato salad on this plate."

The specified food item is the salad, which includes lettuce, carrots, avocado, olive oil, and vinegar. Visually, the salad portion takes up about one third of a standard dinner plate, with visible leafy greens, thin carrot strips, and some chunks of avocado. The lettuce is leafy and low density, the carrots are thin slices, and the avocado pieces add some density. The salad is lightly dressed with oil and vinegar, which would not add notable weight. Estimating volume based on the plate size (approximately 24 cm diameter), the salad portion looks to be around 150-200 ml in volume considering leaves and other components. Taking density into account: lettuce ~0.15 g/ml, carrots ~0.6 g/ml, avocado ~0.95 g/ml (medium density), and averaging for mixed salad, a density estimate around 0.4-0.5 g/ml is reasonable. Multiplying volume (~170 ml midpoint) by density (0.45 g/ml), the estimated weight is about 75-85 grams. A plausible range would be from 70 grams (lighter, more leaves) to 90 grams (more avocado). The midpoint estimate will be 80 grams. This aligns with visible salad bulk on a plate of this size and composition."

The target food is 'pomme' (apple). In the image, the apple is next to a croissant, giving context to size. The apple appears to be of a small to medium size, typical for Swiss apples found in stores or markets. Comparing it to the croissant, which likely weighs around 60-70 grams, the apple is roughly comparable in size or slightly smaller in volume. A typical small apple weighs around 150 grams, but this apple's shape seems slightly shorter and more compact. Therefore, I estimate the apple's weight to be between 120-160 grams, with a midpoint around 140 grams. This estimation is plausible given the visible size and typical density of apples."

There are four distinct pieces of grilled chicken drumettes arranged centrally on the plate. Each drumette appears to be of average size, typical for chicken wings, roughly 6-7 cm long and moderately thick. A standard cooked chicken drumette typically weighs between 40g and 60g depending on size and cooking method. These pieces look slightly on the smaller to medium side, perhaps around 45-50g each. Multiplying by four pieces gives approximately 180-200g. Given some variability in exact size and potential moisture loss from cooking, an estimated total weight range for the four pieces would be between 160g and 210g. Choosing a value near the midpoint yields about 185g. This is consistent with the visible volume and density and fits well with known portion sizes."

The target food item is 'galettes millet haricots noirs maïs', which are visible on the right side of the glass container. There are five visible galettes, each roughly 6-7 cm long, about 3 cm wide, and about 1-1.5 cm thick. These galettes are dense with millet, black beans, and corn, which all contribute to a somewhat compact but not very heavy texture. Each galette likely weighs roughly between 40 and 50 grams given their size and density. For five galettes, the total weight range would be around 200 to 250 grams. Given the visual fullness, the galettes appear to be packed but not overly thick or heavy. Thus, a reasonable estimate near the midpoint is about 225 grams. This estimate aligns well with the relative size of the container and the adjacent courgette and onion portion. Therefore, the best estimate for the total weight of the 'galettes millet haricots noirs maïs' is 225 grams."

The target food item is 'oeufs brouillés' (scrambled eggs), which are located on the upper left side of the plate. Visually, the scrambled eggs cover an area roughly similar to the gnocchi portion but appear less dense and more fluffy. Comparing to the gnocchi pieces on the right and the cauliflower florets on the bottom left, the eggs look like a moderately sized portion of about one large egg equivalent, broken up and cooked. A single large egg weighs approximately 50 grams before cooking, and scrambled eggs can lose a bit of water but remain roughly the same weight in the cooked state due to absorbed fat or milk. The visible volume looks like approximately 1.5 eggs (scrambled), but not excessive piles. Estimating a range, from about 60 grams (small portion) to 90 grams (larger portion) makes sense given the portion size on a medium plate. The midpoint and most reasonable estimate is around 75 grams. This aligns well with the portion size compared to gnocchi and cauliflower pieces on the plate and typical Swiss portions."

These patties are about 6 pieces, small-sized, roughly 6-7 cm diameter and thin, but visibly dense. Considering typical homemade millet patties containing black beans and corn, their density would be moderate to high. Each patty likely weighs around 40-50 grams based on size and density (small millet patties typically weigh around 40g each). Since there are 6 patties densely stacked with visible black beans and corn pieces, total weight is roughly 6 x 45g = 270g. A plausible weight range is around 240g to 300g. Hence, the midpoint estimation of 270g is appropriate and consistent with visual volume and density observed in the image."

Regarding volume, the portion of pasta salad occupies roughly a third of the plate's diameter and appears to be a moderate scoop with some height but not piled very high. The plate is a standard dinner plate (about 25-27 cm diameter) giving scale. Given the pasta shapes and some vegetables, density is moderate, less than plain cooked pasta for an equal volume because of the vegetables and dressing likely present. A typical Swiss portion of pasta salad in such serving size would be approximately 120-160 grams. Considering this, a weight estimate near the middle of this range is reasonable. After a plausibility check, 140 grams is a balanced estimate that fits the visible volume and density cues."

Blueberries are scattered throughout the mixture, visible in moderate quantity but not densely packed. A rough count of visible blueberries suggests around 20-30 berries mixed throughout the bowl. Considering the average weight of a single blueberry is approximately 1 to 1.5 grams, the total weight of blueberries likely lies between 20 and 45 grams. Given they are partially distributed and some could be obscured, a plausible weight range is 25-40 grams. Selecting a midpoint estimate, I choose approximately 33 grams for the weight of the blueberries in this serving. This estimate aligns well with the visible portion size and the mixing density observed in the bowl."

Visually, the chicken breast is a medium portion, roughly the size of a large palm, about 12 cm in length, 7-8 cm wide, and relatively flat with an estimated thickness of about 1.5-2 cm. Considering the density of cooked chicken breast (~1 g/cm³ approximately), and its volume estimated from these dimensions (12 cm x 7.5 cm x 1.8 cm ≈ 162 cm³), the weight should be close to 160 grams. The gravy visible around the chicken does not add mass to the meat itself, so it's not counted. Given this is a typical Swiss-sized portion of chicken on a meal with fries and salad, the weight range could plausibly be 140-180 grams, with 160 grams as a good midpoint estimate. This aligns with common serving sizes seen in local contexts and the visual appearance relative to the surrounding items."

The piece is roughly a rectangular slice about 9 cm long, 4 cm wide, and about 3-4 cm thick. Considering the density of tiramisu, which is moist but spongy with cream, the weight is moderate. Tiramisu usually weighs around 1.0 to 1.2 grams per cubic centimeter. The estimated volume is approximately 9 x 4 x 3.5 = 126 cm³. Multiplying by the density range gives 110-150 grams. The midpoint and best estimate is about 130 grams. This aligns with typical tiramisu slice sizes and the visible portion on the plate."
wrah5h,pomme,95.0,150,55.0,0.6200308532099205,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/383669c9-0f7c-4be9-a917-ab76ffae8ab0,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The food item to estimate is 'pomme' (an apple). Visually, the apple is a single whole fruit with a typical round shape, small stem, and appears to be a relatively small to medium-sized apple compared to the surface it is on. The surface reflections and shadow give an idea of volume. The apple's diameter looks to be around 7-8 cm, a common size for a small apple. Typically, a small to medium apple weighs between 120 and 180 grams. Given the apple's compact shape and no visible slices or parts missing, I estimate its weight around the middle of that range. Thus, I propose a plausible weight range of 120g to 180g, with the final estimate close to 150 grams to account for the observed size."
2ahgvr,salade de pâtes,112.0,60,52.0,0.6911119022190578,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a1dcaa3e-bad0-4d16-a8e3-c6217544e407,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'salade de pâtes' (pasta salad). The image shows a small remaining portion of pasta salad on a plate, consisting mostly of penne pasta, some pieces of corn, cherry tomato halves, and herbs. The pasta pieces appear to be cooked and lightly coated with dressing or herbs. The amount visible covers only a small central area of the plate, with some pasta pieces separated around, so the portion is definitely less than a full serving. Considering the plate size and the average density of pasta salad ingredients (relatively dense cooked pasta, some light vegetables), the visible amount looks like roughly 8-10 penne pieces plus some vegetable bits. A typical full portion of pasta salad in Switzerland might weigh around 200-250 grams, but here it's clearly a leftover fraction. Based on volume and density, the visible quantity seems to be roughly 50 to 70 grams. Splitting the difference, the best estimate is around 60 grams. This is consistent with visual impression and with portion size relative to the plate. The range estimate is 50-70 grams."

The food item to estimate is 'fraises' (strawberries). There are three strawberries placed inside a small green bowl. The bowl diameter appears to be approximately 10-12 cm based on the wooden surface texture and typical size of such bowls. The strawberries are large, with visible leafy tops, and vary slightly in shape but are all substantial in size, approximately 5-6 cm in length each. A typical large strawberry weighs about 25-35 grams. Given the size and density visible in the image, these strawberries seem on the larger side, likely closer to 30-35 grams each. For three strawberries, the total weight could be around 90-105 grams. Since we are to provide weight for 'fraises' as a food name, and considering the bowl contains only the three strawberries, the weight for strawberries is estimated near the midpoint of this range, approximately 95 grams. This estimation matches the visible volume, density, and size of the strawberries in the bowl."

The target food item is 'poivron' (bell pepper), which is the red sliced strips on the plate. Visually, the poivron portion appears to be about one small bell pepper sliced into thin strips, arranged neatly on the plate. Compared to the pieces of chicken and tomato slices nearby, the poivron occupies a modest area but with moderate thickness. A small bell pepper typically weighs about 100 to 150 grams whole. Given this is sliced and some loss from trimming is likely, the visible portion corresponds to approximately two-thirds to three-quarters of a small bell pepper. Therefore, I estimate the poivron weight to be in the range of 65 to 110 grams. The midpoint would be around 85 grams. This makes sense given the portion size relative to other food items and the plate. Hence, 85 grams is a reasonable and plausible estimate."

The specified food item is 'épautre cuit' which is the cooked spelt grains visible on the left side of the glass container. Visually, the spelt covers about one-third of the container's base and appears to be about 2-2.5 cm thick, judging by comparison with the adjacent scrambled eggs and eggplant slices. Considering the density of cooked spelt (similar to cooked whole grains like farro or barley), a volume roughly equivalent to about 200 ml seems reasonable. Cooked grains typically weigh around 1 g/ml given their water content. Therefore, the weight of the cooked spelt portion is approximately between 180g and 220g. Splitting the difference, a weight close to 200g is a solid estimate. This assessment fits well visually with the container size and the relative portion sizes of the other items."

The image shows four Blevita crackers stacked on each other. Each Blevita cracker typically weighs about 13 to 15 grams. Given that there are four crackers, the total weight is approximately 4 times that amount. Multiplying 4 by around 14 grams (midpoint of typical weight) gives about 56 grams. Considering some small variation in cracker thickness and size, a plausible weight range is 52 to 60 grams. Therefore, a reasonable estimate would be near the midpoint of 56 grams."

The specified food item is 'viande' (meat), which is located on the left side of the plate as a cooked, irregularly shaped piece of ground or minced meat. Its size relative to the plate and surrounding items (potatoes and salad) shows it is a medium-sized portion. The meat portion looks roughly 10 cm long, 5 cm wide, and about 1.5 cm thick, giving a rough volume of around 75 cm³. Cooked ground meat has a density around 1.1 g/cm³, so estimated weight is about 75 x 1.1 = 82.5 grams. Considering thickness might be somewhat less dense in places and the piece is uneven, a plausible weight range is 70 to 90 grams. The midpoint and best estimate here is approximately 80 grams, which fits well visually and by portion size standards in Switzerland for a home-cooked meal."

The specified food item is 'pain' (bread). There are two slices of bread on the plate. Both slices appear to be medium thickness, typical of homemade or fresh artisan bread, roughly 1.5 cm thickness each. The size of the slices corresponds to a standard slice of baguette-style bread, approximately 12-14 cm in length and about 7-8 cm in width. Each slice looks dense but not overly thick or heavy. Typical sliced bread of this size weighs around 40-50 grams per slice. Given two slices, the total bread weight is approximately 80-90 grams. To be precise considering the weight of the slices visible, I estimate about 85 grams for the total bread portion seen. The rest (butter, mélasse, Nutella) does not add to the bread weight, so is ignored in this calculation."

The target food is 'pain bis', a type of whole grain or darker bread visible as two slices in the image. Each slice is roughly the size of a standard sandwich slice, which typically weighs between 30-40 grams. Considering the thickness and density of this bread, and accounting for two slices shown, the total weight would be in the range of 60-80 grams. A reasonable midpoint estimate would be about 70 grams for the two slices combined."
r3bub9,raviolis a la courge,143.0,175,32.0,0.5430164946006882,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/r3bub9/dish_media/17c1535c-dc84-4dbb-9668-1d3f9a4a135d,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'raviolis a la courge,' which are clearly visible on the plate, situated in the top left quadrant. There are about 7 ravioli pieces. Each ravioli appears medium-sized, roughly around 5 cm by 5 cm in surface area, and looks to be about 1 cm thick. Cooked ravioli with squash filling has a moderate density due to pasta and squash contents, somewhat dense but not as heavy as pure meat fillings. Considering the visual volume (about 7 pieces covering roughly a palm-sized area with a shallow pile), and comparing to the nearby cherry tomatoes and salad to estimate scale, the total portion likely weighs between 150 and 200 grams. Choosing a value near the midpoint for accuracy and plausibility, I estimate about 175 grams for the raviolis a la courge."

The target food item is 'séré maigre,' a type of low-fat fromage blanc or quark. It appears as the creamy, thick base component in the bowl, mixed with chia seeds and hazelnut purée. The bowl size relative to the spoon suggests a small to medium serving bowl with about 7-8 cm diameter visible. The séré maigre mixed with other ingredients occupies roughly the entire bowl volume, but we must isolate only the séré maigre portion. Considering that chia seeds and nut purée add density and volume, we estimate séré maigre itself constitutes about half to two thirds of the mixture's volume. The mixture is thick but spread evenly through the bowl, with an estimated depth of around 4-5 cm. This translates approximately to a volume around 150-200 ml for séré maigre alone. Knowing séré maigre's density close to water (~1 g/ml), the weight estimate would therefore be between 150 g and 200 g. Selecting a midpoint value for accuracy, we estimate around 175 g for séré maigre. This is consistent for a small bowl breakfast or snack portion and aligns well with the visual cues and mixture context."

The target food is 'salade verte', which is the green leafy salad on the bottom right of the plate. The leaves appear to be iceberg or romaine lettuce with some dressing visible. The volume is moderate, covering an area roughly 1/5th of the plate, but the salad is quite thin with leaves not densely piled. Compared to the portion of rice salad and carrot salad next to it, it is visibly less dense and lighter in weight. Given typical lettuce density and the visible size, the portion likely weighs between 40 and 60 grams. A midpoint estimation in this range would be around 50 grams. This seems plausible considering the plate size and the other food portions on the plate."

The target food item is the gaufre (waffle) visible on the plate. It appears to be a standard small rectangular waffle, roughly the size of a standard European snack waffle, approximately 10cm by 7cm. The waffle is of medium thickness, about 1.5cm to 2cm thick, with an airier (less dense) texture common to waffles. Considering typical density and size, such a waffle usually weighs between 60 to 90 grams. Given the visual thickness and size, an estimate around the midpoint of 75 grams is reasonable. The apple compote covering it does not impact the waffle's weight. So, the estimated weight for the gaufre alone is approximately 75 grams with a plausible range of 60 to 90 grams."
6fwmw2,salade de céleri,49.0,75,26.0,0.1511807286104189,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/6fwmw2/dish_media/1a96e805-fc15-4295-90a7-73a41fcb683f,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The salade de céleri is located at the bottom right corner of the plate and consists of shredded white pieces. The portion appears roughly the size of a large handful spread loosely on the plate. Comparing it visually to the roasted chicken on the plate (which is a moderate portion) and the other denser salads, this celery salad looks less dense and lighter. Given the relatively loose pile and shredded form, it likely weighs less than the carrot salad, which is similarly sized but denser due to its moisture and fibers. The salad seems to have a moisture content that makes it somewhat heavier than dry grated vegetables. A reasonable estimated weight range would be between 60g and 90g. The midpoint, around 75g, fits the volume and density cues observed here. This estimation ensures that the portion aligns with typical Swiss salad side servings and plate size."
wrah5h,pain/galette,90.0,65,25.0,0.266998932004272,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/e3bda09e-e437-4ac8-bfbf-4f282e801bfc,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The food item to estimate is 'pain/galette,' which corresponds visually to the flatbread or wrap that is partially unwrapped in the metal container. The galette looks like a typical thin flatbread or tortilla wrap, folded and containing filling. Based on the size relative to the container and visible texture, it appears to be about 20-22 cm long and about 10-12 cm wide. The flatbread is thin, around 2-3 mm thick on average. This style of galette is similar to a thin tortilla wrap, which commonly weighs about 40-60 grams per piece depending on size and thickness. The flatbread is not overly thick or dense, and some of it may be folded over, but total visible volume is consistent with one standard wrap-type flatbread. Since there are two main folded wraps visible, but the food list specifies only 'pain/galette' singular, I estimate the weight of the whole visible galette item (likely one or two sheets folded, but counted as one portion). Considering the thickness and area, a reasonable plausible range is from 50 grams (if very thin) up to 80 grams (if slightly thicker or two layers). Choosing a midpoint, 65 grams is a solid estimate for this quantity of flatbread. This aligns with typical Swiss cafe portion sizes and the visual volume in the container, avoiding overestimation given the thin flatbread nature."

The specified food item is 'tarte aux fraises,' visible in the image as a slice of strawberry tart on a plate. The tart slice includes a base (likely a pastry crust), a creamy filling, and a generous topping of whole and halved strawberries, plus some red currants. The plate's diameter can be roughly estimated around 20-22 cm based on typical dish sizes, and the tart slice occupies about one-sixth to one-eighth of a standard 20 cm tart. The crust thickness is thin but solid, and the cream layer appears moderately thick. The strawberries, being dense and fresh, add weight. Strawberries typically weigh around 12-15 grams each. There are approximately 6 visible strawberries on top, plus some red currants. The creamy layer likely weighs similarly or a bit more. Taking the crust, filling, and fruit into consideration, the weight range is plausibly between 120 grams (if lighter on cream) and 160 grams (if cream and fruits denser). A midpoint estimate is about 140 grams. This aligns with a typical Swiss-sized slice of strawberry tart of this appearance and volume."

The food item to estimate is pizza, and the image shows a partially eaten slice of pizza on a standard-sized dinner plate. The slice is relatively small, about one quarter or less of a typical pizza slice. It has a visible crust, a layer of tomato sauce, some melted cheese, and three mushroom pieces on top. The crust thickness looks moderate, about 1 to 1.5 cm. The area of the slice is roughly 8x6 cm. Considering the typical density of pizza (dough, tomato sauce, cheese, toppings), a slice of this size normally weighs approximately 70-100 grams. Given the moderate crust thickness, visible toppings, and partial consumption, the estimated weight would be toward the lower end but balanced. The plausible weight range is between 70 and 90 grams, so choosing the midpoint, the estimated weight is about 80 grams. This estimate aligns well with the visual cues of size and the typical weight of a slice of homemade or pizzeria pizza in Switzerland, ensuring it is neither too large nor too small for its appearance."

The specified food item is 'chips vaya beans.' From the image, the chips appear to be relatively thin, crispy, and fairly light, with a size approximately similar to a standard tortilla chip, but they have a slightly puffed texture. The chips fully cover the inner part of a standard size dessert/salad plate, which is about 20 cm in diameter. The pile is somewhat thick, about 2 to 3 cm high. Considering the volume and the texture, these chips are low density but their quantity suggests a moderate total weight. A typical portion of such chips on a plate like this usually ranges between 30g and 50g. Given the visible portion, a mid-range estimate of about 40g is plausible. This matches the visual fullness and typical chip density. Therefore, the best estimate for the weight of the 'chips vaya beans' in the image is 40 grams."

The target food is 'asperges' (asparagus). In the image, there are about 7 asparagus spears laid on the plate. The spears look cooked, as they appear slightly softened but not overly wilted. Each asparagus spear is approximately 18-20 cm long and about 1-1.5 cm thick. A typical cooked asparagus spear weighs around 12-15 grams. Multiplying by 7 spears, the total weight range is approximately 84 to 105 grams. Considering visual fullness and slight variability in thickness, an estimate near the midpoint 95 grams seems reasonable and plausible given the overall volume and size on the plate. This weight fits the density and size cues well, and the amount is consistent with typical serving sizes visible in the image."

The target food is 'carotte' (carrot), and it appears as several thick slices on a white plate. The carrots are cut into rounds roughly 1.5-2 cm thick. There are about 14 visible pieces of carrot evenly spread on the plate. Each carrot slice appears dense but typical for cooked carrot in water or light steaming. The size of each slice suggests a diameter of approximately 3-4 cm. Considering the density of cooked carrot (roughly 0.8 g/cm³), each slice could weigh around 12-14 grams. Multiplying 14 slices by approximately 13 grams per slice gives a range of roughly 150 to 180 grams in total. Allowing for minor weighing variations and small spaces between slices, a plausible weight range is 140-180 grams. The quinoa-bulgur mixture portion size nearby helps confirm this is a moderate single meal portion, consistent with the carrot weight estimate. Thus, a precise estimate near the middle of this range is about 160 grams."

The target food item is a Kinder chocolate bar. The image shows a single, classic Kinder Bueno white chocolate bar segment, identifiable by its characteristic white chocolate coating with dark chocolate stripes and a slightly curved shape. A standard Kinder Bueno white bar weighs approximately 43 grams. The bar in the image is whole and unbroken, with no visible missing parts. There are no other items in the image to adjust the scale, but the wooden surface gives a rough estimate confirming this is a regular-sized bar segment. Given these factors, the weight should match the common packaging weight of the full bar. The plausible weight range is roughly 40 to 45 grams, with 43 grams as a central estimate. This aligns well with the appearance and known portion size of a single Kinder Bueno bar."

The specified food is 'tomates'. In the image, there are three visible tomato wedges, placed on the top part of the galette wrap. Each wedge is medium-sized, likely from a small to medium tomato, each around 2-3 cm in length and width. The total volume is low since they are sliced wedges, not whole tomatoes. Tomatoes have a density of roughly 0.9 g/cm³ and are mostly water, so not very dense but with some moderate weight. Considering their size, three wedges likely weigh between 40 g and 60 g total. The visual amount seems modest, about a small part of a single tomato’s weight. Given this range, a midpoint estimate is around 50 g. This estimate aligns well with the visual portion alongside other ingredients and the plate size context."

The specified food item is 'toast.' The image shows two slices of toasted bread on a plate, each spread with some fromage frais. We need to estimate the weight of one slice of toast only. A typical slice of toast (made from standard sandwich bread) weighs around 30-40 grams before toasting. Toasting reduces water content slightly but does not significantly change the weight. Considering this, one slice of toast likely weighs about 35 grams. The presence of spread does not affect the toast's weight estimation since we exclude the fromage frais weight. The toast slices look like typical square packaged sandwich bread, matching Swiss portion sizes. Given the size compared to the plate and the knife, 35 grams is a reasonable estimate for one slice of toast with slight variance 30-40 grams. Final estimation: 35 grams for one slice of toast."

Each slice has a thin spread of butter that looks uniform and light. Typically, a thin butter spread on a slice of bread is around 5 to 8 grams. Considering the visible surface coverage and quantity, the minimum estimate would be about 5 grams per slice and a maximum about 8 grams per slice. Since there are four slices, the total butter weight is approximately 20 to 32 grams. To be more precise, it looks closer to a thin but adequate spread, so about 6 grams per slice is a balanced average, leading to around 24 grams total. This range fits the visual thickness and area coverage of butter on rustic bread of this size. Therefore, the best estimate for butter weight on these four slices is 24 grams."
p96w4a,tarte à la rhubarbe,105.0,125,20.0,0.2491990032039872,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/e0c92380-fc15-4bbe-90fb-cc2936321050,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a slice of rhubarb tart on a standard-sized dinner plate with a fork and knife for scale. The slice is about one-sixth of a whole tart based on typical tart slicing. The tart slice is relatively thin, approximately 1.5 to 2 cm thick, with visible rhubarb chunks on top and a pastry base. Rhubarb is a low-density vegetable, but the tart has added custard or similar, increasing density slightly. Typical rhubarb tart slices range from 100 to 150 grams for this size slice. Given the size, thickness, and the apparent density of the filling and crust, the plausible weight range is 110 to 140 grams. A value near the midpoint, around 125 grams, is a reasonable and precise estimate for this portion."

The hummous is located at the bottom left of the plate, appearing as a creamy beige paste with a somewhat dense but spreadable texture. Comparing it to the nearby items — such as the green olives, the small round walnut bread rolls, and the sliced strawberries — helps scale its volume. The hummous portion looks like a medium dollop, roughly the size of a large spoonful, about 6-7 cm in length and 3-4 cm wide, with a thickness roughly 1.5-2 cm. Given its creamy density, hummous weighs approximately 1 g/cm3, so the volume can be closely equated to its weight in grams. Estimating the hummous volume to about 20-25 cm3, the weight estimate range is about 20-25 grams. The mid-point that balances visual size and density is about 22 grams. This is plausible given the relatively small portion shown on a standard dinner plate with other items for scale."

The food item to estimate is 'salade'. The salade is visible on the left side of the plate, consisting mainly of fresh green leafy lettuce leaves with some sunflower seeds sprinkled on top. The portion covers roughly one-third of the plate surface. The plate diameter appears to be approximately 25 cm based on common dinner plate sizes. The salad leaves are arranged loosely, with some volume but not densely packed. Considering the light density of leafy greens, and the visual volume coverage, a typical small salad portion on a plate like this weighs between 40 to 60 grams. Given the visible size and typical moisture content, I estimate the salad weighs around 50 grams. This estimation fits well the volume observed and is plausible compared to the rest of the plate that includes the denser risotto. Therefore, the final weight estimate for the salade is 50 grams."

The target food item is 'framboises' (raspberries), which are located on the lower right side of the plate. There are about six visible raspberries, of various sizes but generally medium-sized. Each raspberry typically weighs between 2 to 5 grams depending on size and density. Given the size relative to the strawberries and slice of bread, these raspberries seem fairly plump and fresh, averaging closer to about 4 grams each. Therefore, the total weight for the six raspberries would range approximately from 12 grams (6 x 2g) to 30 grams (6 x 5g). Considering the visual volume and average density of raspberries, a midpoint estimate of about 20 grams is reasonable. This also aligns plausibly with the visible portion size without overestimating their mass."

The food item 'flocon d'avoines' (oat flakes) is visible on the right side of the white bowl. The portion is a small pile, roughly half of the bowl's base area. The oats are loose and not densely packed. Compared to the flax seeds on the left (which are smaller and denser), the oat flakes appear volumetrically larger but less dense. A typical single serving of dry oat flakes is about 40-50 grams, but this looks somewhat smaller due to the visual volume and thin spread. Based on typical density and visual volume, I estimate the oat flakes weigh between 25 and 35 grams. A midpoint estimate of 30 grams is reasonable and consistent with the measured visual portion in the bowl."

The target food is 'tartine mélasse + beurre,' which corresponds to the slice of bread at the bottom of the plate. The bread slice is about 12 cm in length and roughly 5 cm in width, with a thickness of approximately 1.5-2 cm. Typical weight for such a slice of whole grain or rustic bread is around 40-50 grams. The tartine is spread with a layer of butter and a thin layer of molasses (mélasse). Butter added visually appears moderate — about 5 grams of butter can be estimated. The molasses layer is thin and contributes little weight, around 5 grams maximum. Therefore, the sum weight is bread (45 g estimated midpoint) + butter (5 g) + molasses (5 g) = approximately 55 grams in total. A plausible weight range would be 50-60 grams, so selecting 55 grams as a midpoint estimate makes sense given visual thickness and spread coverage. The estimation avoids overestimation by carefully noting the thin spread of liquids and moderate bread size."

The food item to estimate is 'poire' (pear), which is clearly visible in the image as several pieces of cut pear in a rectangular plastic container. The container size appears typical of a small lunchbox container. The pear pieces vary in size but overall appear to come from approximately one medium pear, cut into 6 chunks with skin still attached. A medium pear usually weighs around 150 to 180 grams when whole. Given the pieces fill about half the volume of the container, and accounting for the density and water content of a pear (which is fairly dense but watery), the total visible pieces likely amount to roughly one whole pear. I would estimate the weight range between 140 grams to 180 grams for the pear pieces shown. The midpoint value is about 160 grams. This makes sense given the size of the pieces, the volume inside the container, and typical pear weights."

The target food is 'galettes millet haricots noirs maïs,' which are visible as three patty-shaped portions on the plate. Each patty is roughly 6-7 cm in diameter and about 1.5-2 cm thick. They are dense, composed mainly of cooked millet, black beans, and corn, which gives a moderate density similar to a grain-legume patty. Estimating the volume: each patty is approximately the size of a medium thick palm-sized patty. Volume per patty roughly: 6.5 cm diameter circle area (~33 cm²) × 1.7 cm thickness = about 56 cm³. Three patties total volume about 168 cm³. Considering the density of cooked grains and legumes combined, approximately 1.1 g/cm³, the total weight is around 185 grams. Accounting for some air holes and uneven texture, a plausible range is 160-210 g. The midpoint and best estimate is about 185 g for the three galettes combined. This is consistent with the plate size and other food portions present, making this a reasonable estimation."

The target food item is a 'branche de chocolat,' a chocolate-covered bar with visible nut pieces or crisps. The chocolate bar appears to be a small-sized snack bar held in a hand, which serves as a good size reference. The visible length of the bar is roughly the same as the width of two fingers, suggesting a length around 7-9 cm. The thickness is about 1.5 cm, and width about 2-2.5 cm. Considering the dense nature of chocolate and added crunch inclusions inside, the estimated volume is roughly a small candy bar size. Typical chocolate bars of this size usually weigh between 30-50 grams. Given the visual size and density, a plausible weight range would be approximately 35-45 grams. Choosing a midpoint, 40 grams is a reasonable and consistent weight estimate for this 'branche de chocolat.'"

The specified food item is 'demi croissant', which visually corresponds to a half croissant piece on the plate. The piece is small, roughly the size of a typical half croissant, with a fluffy and layered interior typical of croissants. Considering the volume of this half piece and typical croissant density (which is light but buttery), a full croissant usually weighs around 50-60 grams in Switzerland. Since this is about half of a croissant, the expected weight falls between 25 and 30 grams. The addition of butter and apricot jam adds minimal extra weight, so those are excluded from this estimate. Given the visual clues — the size relative to the plate and the visible thickness — an estimate near the midpoint is reasonable. Thus, the estimated weight of the demi croissant piece alone is 28 grams."

The vinaigrette sauce here appears to be lightly drizzled over the tofu and vegetables rather than serving as a separate substantial portion. It shows small droplets and a thin coating effect on the tofu, carrot, and other vegetables but no visible pool of liquid. The container size is roughly a standard lunchbox size (about 1.5 liters total capacity) and the sauce occupies a very small volume proportionally. Typical vinaigrette usage in such a serving is around 10-20 grams. Given the visible amount and that only a light coating is present on most ingredients, I estimate the vinaigrette sauce in this container weighs between 10 and 20 grams, with a final estimate near the midpoint at 15 grams. This is plausible given that the vinaigrette looks like a thin dressing rather than a thick sauce or large quantity."

The target food item is myrtilles (blueberries), which are the small round blue fruits located on the left side of the plate. There are about 14 visible blueberries. Each average blueberry weighs roughly 1 to 1.5 grams. Given the size of the plate and the clear view of the berries, there seems to be a small pile covering a modest area without stacking much, suggesting no hidden layers. Therefore, the total weight range would be approximately 14 to 21 grams, with the midpoint around 17 grams. Considering some variability in size and density, an estimate of 17 grams for the myrtilles is plausible and consistent with the visual evidence and typical berry weights."

The target food item is 'pain', which corresponds to the slice of bread on the plate. The bread slice is a medium-thick slice of whole grain or brown bread, approximately the size of the plate's radius (around 10-12 cm in length). Typically, a medium slice of whole wheat bread weighs between 30 and 40 grams. Given the thickness and size observed, the slice is likely closer to a standard weight around 35 grams. This fits well with the visual size in comparison to the omelette slices and the plate size. Therefore, estimating the bread slice weight around 35 grams is reasonable."

Chocolate bars of this size, especially those with added texture or nuts, usually weigh in the range of 30 to 45 grams. Given its thickness and texture, a plausible weight range would be 35 to 45 grams. Choosing a value near the middle of this range, I estimate the weight as 40 grams.

Considering typical butter density and thickness, it looks like a typical small pat of butter served with bread. Standard single servings of butter for bread are usually around 10-15 grams. Given the visible size and common portioning, a plausible weight range for this pat of butter is 10 to 15 grams. Placing the estimate near the midpoint, about 13 grams is reasonable.

The texture and density appear moderately dense, combining millet (light but grainy), corn (light), and black beans (denser). Given the size and compactness, a single galette of this size in Switzerland would typically weigh around 40-50 grams. Since there are two galettes, the total combined weight would be about 80-100 grams. Considering slight variability in compactness and moisture, a plausible weight range is 75 to 105 grams. Choosing the midpoint gives around 90 grams total for both galettes. The estimation aligns well with the visible volume relative to the container size and the other foods."

The size relative to the wooden surface suggests it is about 8-10 cm long and about 2-3 cm wide, with an approximate thickness of around 1 cm. The usual weight for this type of Kinder chocolate bar is about 12 grams per single stick. The visual does not indicate it is a fraction or broken piece; it looks like a whole bar.

The target food item is 'graine de chia' (chia seeds), which are visually identifiable in the glass jar as small black seeds dispersed mostly within the mixture. The container is a small glass jar filled nearly to the top with a creamy mixture composed mainly of yogurt, oat flakes, oat bran, honey, almond purée, and chia seeds. Visually, the chia seeds are mixed evenly but do not form a separate layer; they are embedded throughout the visible volume. Chia seeds are dense but used in small quantities because they expand significantly when combined with liquids, forming a gel-like texture. The total volume of the jar looks to be approximately 250 ml to 300 ml, and the chia seeds appear to represent roughly 5-7% of the total volume (judging by number and visual density). Typical chia seed density is about 0.7 g/ml, but due to expansion and gel formation, the weight of dry seeds is much less relative to volume in liquid. A typical serving for chia seeds in such a preparation is around 15 grams. Here, from the visual proportion and mixture density, the plausible range for chia seeds is roughly 10 to 20 grams. Choosing a midpoint estimate with slight caution leads to approximately 15 grams. This estimation aligns with typical physics of chia seeds and the visual evidence in the jar."

The spinach leaves look fresh and not densely packed, lying flat and stacked up to about 1-2 cm depth overall. Fresh spinach leaves have a low density, roughly 30-40 grams per 100 ml. The volume appears to be around 150-200 ml of loosely piled leaves. This suggests a total weight range of about 45 to 80 grams (considering the light leafy nature and loose layering). A midpoint estimate of about 60 grams is reasonable and aligns with the visual volume without overestimating the weight given the loose and fresh leaves. Therefore, 60 grams is a well-grounded estimate for the quantity of fresh spinach visible in the bowl."

Using the chicken strips and green beans on the left as size references, the metal container seems to be a standard meal tray approximately 20x15 cm in size. The pasta layer looks to be about 2.5 cm thick, judging by the volume and the way it sits relative to other foods. Cooked pasta typically weighs around 130-150 grams per 100 ml volume. Given the estimated volume (~20 cm x 7.5 cm x 2.5 cm = ~375 cm³), and considering some space within pasta is air, the weight would be about 125-160 grams.

Visually, the vegetables occupy roughly a quarter of the plate, piled moderately without being heaped. The pieces of courgette and onion are medium sliced, and the overall volume is moderate, not densely packed but somewhat compact due to cooking. Considering the usual portion size for sautéed courgettes and onions in Swiss home meals with one tablespoon of oil, the estimated volume corresponds to about 150-200 grams. The density of cooked zucchini and onion is around 0.8-0.9 g/cm3. Given the visual volume and density, the weight is likely near the midpoint of this range.

Therefore, the total weight of the yogurt content is close to the container's standard filling. Comparing with the apple next to it (which is about 75-100 grams), the yogurt container volume aligns with a typical 125g yogurt portion.

Chia seeds are small and very light, and in typical recipes like this, they are used in relatively small amounts. Visually, the chia seeds are spread evenly but their quantity is low compared to the overall volume of the mixture. The bowl size is about a medium breakfast bowl, and the total volume of the mixture is roughly 200-250 grams. Chia seeds here likely weigh between 10 to 20 grams, as more would result in a much denser visible presence of the tiny black dots. Given the dispersion and visual density, a reasonable estimate would be near the midpoint of this range. Therefore, the estimated weight of the ""graines de chia"" in the bowl is about 15 grams."

The specified food item is 'oeuf' (egg), which in the image is represented by a half of a hard-boiled egg placed on the plate. A whole medium chicken egg typically weighs about 50 grams including shell, while the edible content inside (without shell) is roughly 43-45 grams. Since only half an egg is visible and appears fully cooked and typical in size, the weight estimate should be approximately half the edible content of a normal egg. This gives a weight range of about 20 to 25 grams. Considering the slight moisture loss from cooking and partial appearance, the range of 20-25 grams is plausible. The visual size compared to the other ingredients (rice grains, cherry tomatoes) supports that this egg half is not unusually large or small. Therefore, a solid estimate near the midpoint, around 22 grams, is justified."

The target food item is 'beurre' (butter), which is visible as a small pat on the plate near the bottom right. Its size can be compared to the two small toasted breads and the slices of sliced roasted chicken on the same plate, as well as the butter block in its wrapper at the upper left. The butter portion looks like a small serving used for spreading on the bread pieces. Considering typical butter portions in Switzerland, a small pat of butter for individual use usually weighs between 10 and 15 grams. The visible butter is a single compact piece, roughly 2 cm long and 1 cm wide with a slight thickness, indicating approximately 12 grams. This estimate aligns well with the visual size relative to the plate and other foods, and it is plausible for spreading on the two small bread slices. Therefore, the estimated weight for the butter is 12 grams, within a reasonable range of 10-15 grams."

The target food item is a 'barre de chocolat kinder,' visually identified as a Kinder White chocolate bar with characteristic stripes. Typically, a single Kinder chocolate bar weighs approximately 12 to 15 grams. By comparing the bar to the wooden surface texture and its relative size, it appears to be a standard full-sized piece, not broken or partial. The volume and density of such chocolate bars are consistent with this weight range. Therefore, estimating within a plausible range of 12 to 15 grams, I choose a mid-value of 14 grams to best represent the visible portion."

The target food item is carottes (carrots). They are visible as thin slices mixed with the pasta and eggplant. The carrot pieces appear to be scattered mainly on one side of the bowl. Considering the size of the bowl and the visible amount of carrot slices, they cover about 15-20% of the surface area of the bowl at a shallow depth, typical for cooked carrots sliced thinly. Carrots have moderate density but these are thin slices, so the weight is less than it would be if chopped more thickly or piled. Based on the visual volume and distribution, the total carrot portion likely weighs around 25 to 40 grams. Taking the midpoint and considering the visual clues and the spread of carrots, an estimate of approximately 32 grams is reasonable and consistent with the appearance relative to the other foods in the bowl."

The target food item is 'huile de lin' (linseed oil). Typically, oil portions are small and not visually prominent in mixed dishes since they are liquid and often used as dressing or cooking medium. In the image, the oil is not distinctly visible as a separate entity, suggesting it is likely mixed in with other foods or lightly drizzled. Given the size of the plate and the other portions, a reasonable estimate for linseed oil used in a meal like this would be about 1 tablespoon (roughly 15 ml). The density of linseed oil is close to 0.93 g/ml, so 15 ml corresponds to approximately 14 grams. A plausible range is 10-20 grams considering possible minimal drizzling or mixing in. Therefore, the final estimate is 14 grams for huile de lin."

The mayonnaise is the white creamy portion on the left side of the plate. It is presented as a small swirl or dollop, occupying a roughly circular area about 4-5 cm in diameter and about 1.5 to 2 cm in thickness. Mayonnaise is dense and creamy, so its density is close to 0.9-1 g/ml. The volume visually appears to be around 20-25 ml, which corresponds roughly to 20-25 grams because mayonnaise has a density close to water. Given the size on the plate compared to the other foods and the fork above, this estimation is plausible. The range can be 18-28 grams, with the midpoint about 23 grams, but to keep a clean round value, 22 grams is a good supported estimate."
wrah5h,mozzarella,54.0,48,6.0,0.03844784620861517,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1550c506-8c95-461f-b658-8f427dc2a0af,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The mozzarella is the white portion placed on top of the pasta in the image. Visually, it appears to be a fresh, soft type, likely cottage cheese or a similar mozzarella variant, with a somewhat fluffy texture rather than a dense block. The portion size is moderate, roughly a rounded scoop about 6 cm long, 4 cm wide, and about 2-3 cm thick. Given the texture, the density will be less than a hard cheese but more than whipped cream—approximately 0.7 to 0.9 g/cm³. Estimating volume as roughly 6 cm x 4 cm x 2.5 cm = 60 cm³. Applying density range 0.7 to 0.9 g/cm³ yields a weight range between 42 g and 54 g. Choosing a final estimate near the midpoint gives approximately 48 grams. This estimate matches the visual portion size compared to the surrounding foods on the plate and the typical serving size of fresh mozzarella or similar variants in Swiss meals."

The target food is 'salade' on the plate alongside risotto. The salad portion appears to be small and consists mainly of leafy greens with some small bits of other vegetables or dressing. The size relative to the risotto and knife gives a good scale: the salad occupies a compact area roughly 6 cm by 4 cm, and the leaves are layered but not piled very thick—about 1 to 1.5 cm thick. Given that lettuce and similar greens have low density (about 0.2 to 0.3 g/cm³), the volume estimated is approximately 6 cm x 4 cm x 1.5 cm = 36 cm³. Multiplying by an average density of 0.25 g/cm³ results in about 9 grams. Considering slight dressing and small additional vegetables, it is reasonable to give a range of 8-12 grams. The midpoint would be around 10 grams. This is consistent with the small visible portion on the plate and the typical weight of such a salad amount. Therefore, the best estimate for the salad weight is 10 grams."

The specified food item is 'oeufs' (eggs). Visually, there are two fried eggs on top of a plate of pasta, marked with ketchup. Each fried egg appears to be typical size, roughly 10 cm in diameter, fairly thin as is common for fried eggs, with visible edges and cooked yolks. An average fried egg weighs about 45-50 grams. Two eggs combined would thus weigh approximately 90-100 grams. Given the visual clues, such as the egg whites spread thin and the yolks intact but not overly large, I estimate a plausible range from 85 to 105 grams total for the two eggs. Considering density and slight moisture loss, a midpoint estimate of 95 grams is reasonable. The ketchup and pasta do not add to the egg weight, so they are excluded. This weight aligns well with the visual size compared to the plate and noodles. Therefore, the best estimate for the two fried eggs together is 95 grams."

The target food item is 'tomate' (tomato), which visually is the red sliced portion in the middle of the container. The container appears to be a typical meal prep box around 15 cm long and 10 cm wide. The tomato slices cover about one-third of the bottom surface and appear relatively thin, about 0.5 to 1 cm thick. Tomatoes are mostly water and have a density close to 1 g/cm³. Assuming the tomato portion occupies roughly 15 cm x 3 cm x 1 cm = 45 cm³, this converts to approximately 45 grams. Allowing for some variability in slice thickness and packing, a plausible weight range is 40-50 grams. The midpoint and final estimation will be 45 grams, which fits well with the visible volume relative to the other items."

The specified food item is 'beurre' (butter) spread on a slice of tresse bread with apricot jam. From the image, the butter layer appears thin and spread evenly beneath the jam on a single slice of bread about 10 cm in length and 6-7 cm in width. A typical thin spread of butter on a slice this size usually weighs between 5 to 10 grams. Given the moderate visible thickness and coverage, the butter here is more likely near the lower-middle of this range. Considering typical butter density and spread volume, a plausible estimation range is 6-9 grams, with a midpoint close to 7.5 grams. I estimate the butter weight on this slice to be about 8 grams, which fits well with the visual clues and portion size."

The 'tomme fleurette' is identified as the soft cheese piece with a white bloomy rind and creamy interior, located near the center bottom of the plate, slightly to the right. The piece looks roughly triangular, about 4 cm wide at the base and 3 cm in height, with a thickness of approximately 1.5 cm. Tomme fleurette is a soft to semi-soft cheese, with moderate density—so volume is a good guide. Estimating volume around 18 cm³ (4 x 3 x 1.5 / 2 for triangle approximated to a wedge). Typical density for soft cheese is around 0.9 g/cm³, implying roughly 16-18 grams weight. Given some margin due to irregular shape and slightly variable density, a plausible range is 15-22 grams. The estimated weight near the midpoint would be 18 grams. This fits visually compared to the other cheese portions and objects like the bread slice and fish on the plate, and maintains consistency with expected Swiss cheese portions."

The target food item is 'pain' (bread), of which there are clearly two pieces visible on the plate. Both pieces appear to be torn portions of rustic or artisanal bread, roughly each about half of a small slice. The bread has visible texture with some holes, typical of a light but crunchy bread. Given the visual size relative to the plate and the butter and jam coverage, each piece looks to be about 10 cm long and 5-6 cm wide, with an approximate thickness of 1.5-2 cm. Bread typically weighs around 250-300 grams per 1000 cm3, and these two halves combined seem to have a volume around 30-40 cm3 each, giving an estimated 8-12 g per half slice. Both together would be roughly 18-22 g. Since the prompt only refers to 'pain' as the item, I concentrate on the combined bread weight visible on the plate. Thus, a plausible weight estimate for the bread visible here is around 20 grams, within a reasonable range of 15-25 grams considering the irregular shape and density of the bread."

The specified food item is parmesan. In the image, the risotto with asparagus and parmesan is visible as a single mixed dish, with no separate visible solid parmesan chunks or shavings prominently shown. The cheese is likely incorporated into the risotto, melted and mixed in. Thus, the parmesan portion must be estimated as the cheese content within the visible risotto serving. Typical risotto recipes with cheese include about 10-20% of the dish weight as parmesan. The risotto portion on the plate is roughly a small serving, about 150-180 grams in total. The parmesan is likely about 15-20 grams within that mix. Because the cheese is not separately visible but integrated, and considering swiss portion sizes, a reasonable estimate is around 18 grams with a plausible range from 12 to 24 grams of parmesan in the serving."

The target food item is 'crème de marrons' spread on a piece of bread. Visually, the spread layer is thin but covers most of the bread surface. The bread piece appears to be a small slice of crusty bread, roughly 10 cm long and about 4 cm wide in the thickest part. The thickness of the spread is thin, approximately 2-3 mm thick. The density of 'crème de marrons' (chestnut cream) is similar to a thick jam or preserve, which is roughly 1 g/cm³. Estimating the volume: roughly 10 cm x 4 cm x 0.25 cm = 10 cm³ volume. Given the density about 1 g/cm³, the weight is about 10 grams. Considering some possible variation in spread thickness and spread area, a plausible weight range is from 8 to 12 grams, with a midpoint around 10 grams. Therefore, the final estimated weight of the chestnut cream on the bread is 10 grams."

The target food item is 'pousses de graines' which are visible in the center-left part of the bowl as small, thin germinated sprouts. They form a loose pile mixed lightly with spinach leaves and cherry tomato halves. The portion appears moderate in volume but these sprouts are very light and airy, with a low density. Given their roughly 7-8 cm spread and sparse layering, the volume corresponds to about a handful of sprouts typically weighed around 20-40 grams. Considering the visual density and the area covered, a plausible weight range is between 25 and 40 grams. The midpoint at about 32 grams fits well with their observed mass relative to the size of cherry tomatoes and spinach leaves on the plate. This estimation aligns with common values for fresh sprouted seed portions in salad bowls."

The target food is 'beurre' (butter) visible on the two slices of bread. We see butter spread lightly under the layer of molasses on one slice and mixed slightly under the Nutella on the other slice. The typical spread of butter here is thin and patchy, not a thick layer. From the bread slice size (approximately a standard slice of rustic bread around 12cm long and 7 cm wide), and the thin spread of butter, I'd estimate a small amount. Butter density is around 0.95 g/cm3. Given the spread, the butter likely weighs between 6 and 10 grams total. Taking midpoint 8 grams makes sense as it covers a thin butter layer rather than a heavy spread. This is consistent with the visible volume and the typical butter usage on toast in Switzerland."

The target food item is 'pain' (bread), which appears as a single slice placed on a plate. The slice is round and medium-thick, roughly the size of a small bun or roll half, judging by its size relative to the plate and the texture of the crumb. A typical slice of white bread or bun of this size in Switzerland weighs approximately 30-40 grams. Since this slice is about half a bun, it is denser and thicker than a thin sandwich slice but still moderate in size. The visible thickness and crumb density suggest a weight range of 30 to 40 grams. Choosing a midpoint for accuracy, I estimate the bread slice weighs about 35 grams. This estimate fits the visible size and common bread slice weights, with no irregularities observed."

The pasta portion is spiral-shaped, cooked, and loosely piled, covering an area around 10 cm by 8 cm with an estimated thickness of about 2 cm. Cooked pasta density is roughly 0.8 g/cm3 due to water content. Volume estimate: 10 cm x 8 cm x 2 cm = 160 cm3. Weight estimate: 160 cm3 x 0.8 g/cm3 = approx. 128 g. Considering some air gaps, the weight range can be from 110 to 140 grams, so a midpoint of about 125 grams is reasonable. This fits well compared to the visual size and other foods on the plate."

The target food is 'biscuit' in the image. The biscuit appears as several small, thin, crispy pieces placed on top of the ice cream. These biscuits are likely wafer or crisp cookies, probably around 2-3 mm thick each, with visible cracks and a light, brittle texture. Given the size relative to the ice cream scoop (about 6-7 cm in diameter), the total visible biscuit pieces cover roughly 30-40 cm² in surface area but are very thin. Since biscuits of this type generally have a low density (around 0.5-0.7 g/cm3), and the volume is small, the total weight should be modest. Estimating the thickness as about 0.3 cm and an area of roughly 30 cm², volume is approximately 9 cm³. At a density near 0.6 g/cm³, this gives approximately 5.4 grams. Considering some variability, a plausible weight range for the biscuit pieces is 4 to 7 grams. Final estimate near the midpoint: 6 grams. This aligns with the visual lightness and thinness of the biscuit pieces on top of the ice cream, without overestimating their mass."

Typical fresh artisan bread slice of this size in Switzerland weighs around 30 to 40 grams. The three pieces combined approximate about 2.5 slices in total given the partial piece. Hence, total weight likely ranges between 70g and 100g. Choosing a midpoint towards 85g is reasonable for the visible amount of 'pain' considering the size, density, and partial slice. This estimate excludes the weight of butter and strawberry jam, which are spread very thinly and will be handled separately if needed."

Each slice of bread is about the size of a typical slice of rustic bread (approximately 70-80 grams per slice of bread but we focus on just the butter). The butter coverage is light and uneven. A thin spread of butter usually weighs around 5 to 10 grams per slice of this size. Given that both slices have butter, but only part of each slice is covered, and considering the visible volume and typical density of butter, the total butter weight on both slices combined is likely around 10 to 15 grams. To estimate only the butter on one slice: it looks like butter is on both slices roughly equally, so about 5 to 7.5 grams of butter per slice. Since the user did not specify which slice's butter weight they need, but mentioned 'beurre' in general, I'll provide the estimated weight for butter on one slice.

The slices seem to be around 2 mm thick individually. Estimating the volume of one slice as roughly a 3.5 cm diameter circle with 0.2 cm thickness: volume ≈ π * (1.75 cm)² * 0.2 cm ≈ 1.92 cm³ per slice. For 7 slices, total volume is about 13.4 cm³.

The melasse layer is thin and unevenly spread, covering roughly half the surface area of the slice with a light glaze. Considering melasse's density, which is thick but spread in a thin layer, the volume is quite small. Typical thin spreads of molasses-like syrups on bread are around 4 to 7 grams per slice depending on spread thickness, and here it appears moderate but not thick. Given this, the plausible weight range is 4 to 7 grams. Selecting a midpoint consistent with the visible thin layer, an estimate of 6 grams is reasonable. This accounts for the thin but noticeable spread and matches usual practices for molasses toppings on bread in Switzerland. The estimation is plausible since melasse is dense but applied sparingly."
xjvrtk,œuf dur,50.0,50,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/b53715cb-f3f5-4abf-bd1d-b7264f7f0a86,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'œuf dur' (hard-boiled egg), which is visually identifiable as two halves of a boiled egg placed on the left side of the plate. The egg is cut in half and appears well cooked with a firm yolk. A typical hard-boiled egg weighs about 50 grams whole. Since there are clearly two halves from one egg, the total egg weight is likely near that standard. The yolk and white volume and density are consistent with a standard medium-sized egg. The context (other foods of known volume) doesn't affect the egg size. The egg halves occupy a small section of the plate relative to the comparatively larger bulgur and ratatouille portions, confirming this is a single egg. Therefore, I estimate the weight to be around 50 grams, with a plausible range of 45 to 55 grams due to typical size variations in eggs. The midpoint is 50 grams, which is suitable here."
ppf8hc,maréchal,15.0,15,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/2d798449-e3c7-4b6e-9f74-d788f51b5ce7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The maréchal (a type of cheese) is visible as small cubes on the plate among the salad leaves and cucumber slices. Each cube is approximately 1.5 cm per side, and there are about 4 cubes visible. Cheese is dense, approximately 1 gram per cm³. The total volume for 4 cheese cubes, estimated at about 1.5x1.5x1.5 cm each, is roughly 4 x 3.375 cm³ = 13.5 cm³. This corresponds to about 13 to 15 grams of cheese. Considering some margin for slight variation in cube size and density, a plausible weight range is 12 to 18 grams. The midpoint and best estimate is therefore 15 grams."
