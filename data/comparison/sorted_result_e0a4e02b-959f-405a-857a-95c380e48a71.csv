The porridge is served in a medium-sized bowl, and it appears to fill about two-thirds of the bowl. Porridge is dense and has a relatively high weight-to-volume ratio due to its water content. Based on the visible portion and typical serving sizes for porridge in a bowl of this size, I estimate the weight of the porridge to be approximately 250 grams."
p96w4a,délice tomate mozzarella,54.0,210,156.0,1.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/5ebafbd6-315d-44a6-8508-ba143d23adb2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The 'délice tomate mozzarella' consists of alternating slices of tomato and mozzarella, drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and sprinkled with herbs. From the image, there are approximately 5 slices of tomato and 5 slices of mozzarella. Each slice of tomato appears to be a medium-sized slice, likely from a medium tomato, and each slice of mozzarella is of similar size and thickness. A medium tomato slice typically weighs around 20-25 grams, and a slice of mozzarella of this size typically weighs around 20 grams. Therefore, the total weight of the tomato slices is approximately 100-125 grams, and the mozzarella slices weigh around 100 grams. Adding these together, the total weight of the 'délice tomate mozzarella' is approximately 200-225 grams. Considering the visible portion and the density of the ingredients, I estimate the weight to be 210 grams."

The courgette and onions are located on the left side of the container. They appear to be cooked and chopped into small pieces. The portion fills about half of the container, which is a rectangular glass dish. Cooked courgette and onions are not very dense, so their weight will be less than their volume might suggest. Based on the visible portion size and typical density of cooked courgette and onions, I estimate the weight to be approximately 150 grams."

The specified food item is 'concombre' (cucumber). In the image, the cucumber is cut into medium-sized chunks and mixed with other ingredients in a glass container. The cucumber pieces are distributed throughout the dish, and their volume appears to make up a significant portion of the total mixture. Considering the size of the container and the visible amount of cucumber, I estimate that the cucumber weighs approximately 100 grams. This accounts for the density and typical weight of cucumber chunks, as well as their proportion relative to the other ingredients."

The image shows a bowl of grated carrot salad (salade de carottes) with vinaigrette. The bowl appears to be moderately filled, and the grated carrots are loosely packed, which means the density is relatively low. A typical serving of grated carrots in a bowl of this size would weigh around 150-200 grams, including the vinaigrette. Considering the visible portion and the likely weight of the vinaigrette, I estimate the total weight of the 'salade de carottes' to be approximately 180 grams."

The specified food item is 'avocat' (avocado). In the image, there are two slices of avocado visible, each approximately 1/4 of an avocado. Avocados are dense and creamy, and a single medium avocado typically weighs around 200-250 grams. Since the visible portion is about half of an avocado, the weight of the avocado slices can be estimated as 100-125 grams. Considering the size and thickness of the slices, I estimate the weight to be approximately 110 grams."

The ratatouille is visible as part of the filling inside the wrap. It appears to be a small portion mixed with the grilled chicken and other ingredients. Based on the visible volume of the ratatouille in the cut section of the wrap, and considering that it is a cooked vegetable dish with a relatively low density, I estimate the weight of the ratatouille to be approximately 40 grams. This accounts for the portion visible and assumes a small amount is distributed throughout the rest of the wrap filling."

The mozzarella is visible as two slices on the plate. Each slice appears to be a standard thickness and size for fresh mozzarella, likely from a medium-sized ball. Fresh mozzarella is dense and has a high water content, so it is relatively heavy for its size. Based on the size of the slices compared to the other items on the plate (e.g., the bread and tomato slices), I estimate that the two slices together weigh approximately 60 grams."

The image shows a wrap made with a flatbread (galette) containing grilled chicken (poulet grillé) and ratatouille. The grilled chicken is mixed with the ratatouille inside the wrap. Based on the visible portion of the filling, the chicken appears to be a significant but not dominant component of the filling. Assuming the wrap contains approximately 30-40% chicken by weight, and estimating the total filling weight to be around 150 grams, the weight of the grilled chicken would be approximately 50 grams. This estimation accounts for the visible portion of the filling and the typical density of cooked chicken."

The image shows two slices of tarte aux épinards (spinach tart) on a standard-sized dinner plate. Each slice appears to be a triangular portion of a medium-sized tart. The tart has a visible crust, a filling of spinach, cheese, and possibly eggs, which are typical ingredients for such a dish. Based on the size of the slices and the density of the filling, I estimate that each slice weighs approximately 120 grams. Since there are two slices, the total weight of the tarte aux épinards on the plate is approximately 240 grams."

The image shows a bowl of cereal with milk. The cereal appears to be a flake-type cereal, which is relatively light and low in density. The bowl is not completely full, and the cereal is mixed with milk, which makes it harder to estimate the exact volume of the cereal alone. Based on the visible portion, I estimate that the cereal occupies about half of the bowl's volume. For a standard bowl of this size, this would correspond to approximately 30-40 grams of cereal. Considering the density and the visible portion, I estimate the weight of the cereal to be 35 grams."

The image shows a bowl containing two distinct food items: dark brown seeds (graines de chia) and light-colored flakes (flocon d'avoines). The chia seeds occupy approximately half of the bowl's surface area. Chia seeds are dense and small, so their weight is relatively high for their volume. Based on the visible portion, the amount of chia seeds appears to be around 2 tablespoons, which typically weighs about 30 grams. This estimation is based on the visual volume and typical density of chia seeds."
