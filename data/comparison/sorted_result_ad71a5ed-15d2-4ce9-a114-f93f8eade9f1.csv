The image shows a slice of bread topped with caviar d'aubergines. The bread slice appears to be a regular slice of bread, not too thick. I will estimate the weight of the bread slice based on its visible size and thickness. The bread slice is approximately 10cm x 8cm and about 1.5cm thick. A typical slice of bread of this size and thickness would weigh around 30 grams."
