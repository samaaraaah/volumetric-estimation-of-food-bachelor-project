The image shows a 'branche de chocolat,' which is a chocolate stick. The chocolate appears to be partially unwrapped, and its size can be estimated based on the hand holding it. The stick is relatively thin and elongated, with a textured surface indicating nuts or crisped rice. Based on the typical size of such chocolate sticks in Switzerland, they usually weigh between 20-30 grams. Given the visible portion and the standard packaging, I estimate the weight of this chocolate stick to be approximately 25 grams."
