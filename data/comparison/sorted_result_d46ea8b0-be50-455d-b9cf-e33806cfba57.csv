wrah5h,pain/galette,90.0,350,260.0,2.7767888928444284,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/e3bda09e-e437-4ac8-bfbf-4f282e801bfc,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'pain/galette,' represented here as two wraps or galettes inside a metal container. Reference objects include the metal container and a faint glimpse of the scale underneath. A typical dinner plate is 26-28 cm, and this container is smaller; estimating its visible internal length to be approximately 20 cm and width about 12 cm. The galettes themselves appear folded in two or rolled. Each galette seems to be about 18 cm long and 8-9 cm wide when flattened. The galettes have a thin, flatbread structure, probably around 2-3 mm thick when flat, but rolled here, giving an approximate thickness for volume estimation of around 1.5 cm conservatively. The geometric volume per rolled galette is approximately length × width × thickness = 18 cm × 9 cm × 1.5 cm = 243 cm³ for each. There are two galettes, but the second one is partially obscured, so we only estimate the visible portion to one and a half galettes (1.5 × 243 = 365 cm³). The galette is a dense solid similar to flatbread, so density approximately 1 g/cm³. No hidden-layer multiplier needed as these are discrete rolled wraps. Packing factor is 1 as it's solid dough. Effective volume is approximately 365 cm³; thus weight estimate is 365 g. Swiss typical single portion of a similar flatbread or galette is around 120-180 g, so two galettes would be 240-360 g approximately, consistent with our volume-based calculation. The container capacity is roughly 20 cm × 13 cm × 5 cm = 1300 cm³ max, so 90% capacity is 1170 cm³, much larger than the 365 cm³ effective volume, so this estimate is plausible. Weight range factoring some thickness and folding variation: low 300 g to high 400 g, midpoint ~350 g aligns well with typical portion sizes. Therefore, estimate 350g total for the 'pain/galette'."
ppf8hc,spaghetti,217.0,470,253.0,6.514892607096238,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/7c7d7932-0ffe-47e1-83e9-2289044511e5,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Reference objects: the black plate (dinner plate ≈ 26 cm diameter). The spaghetti mound covers roughly a circular area about 20 cm diameter on the plate, with a height estimate of about 3 cm, typical for a pasta serving on a plate. Geometric volume = π × (10 cm radius)^2 × 3 cm height ≈ 942 cm^3. Spaghetti is loosely packed, approximate packing factor = 0.5. No hidden layers beyond the visible mound as pasta lies mostly flat. Effective volume = 942 cm^3 × 0.5 = 471 ml. Density for cooked pasta is about 0.7 g/ml. Estimated weight range using ±20% uncertainty: low ≈ 378 g, high ≈ 565 g. Typical single portion weight for cooked spaghetti is 150–250 g. The upper physical capacity of the plate for pasta is roughly 90% of about 26 cm diameter plate's volume if piled about 3 cm thick, which aligns with roughly 1100 ml max, so no container size constraint is violated. Since the volume-derived weight estimate is about double a typical single portion, the plate looks to hold a generous double portion of spaghetti, which is plausible given the image. So, estimating spaghetti weight at midpoint ~470 g is reasonable."
2ahgvr,salade grecque,315.0,500,185.0,6.915272338910644,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/c476a6d0-acb2-45fd-b168-84822bc98003,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Reference object is the plastic container, which appears to be a standard food storage box approximately 15 cm long, 10 cm wide, and about 8 cm tall. Geometric volume is 15 cm × 10 cm × 8 cm = 1200 cm³. The salad fills about 70% of the container volume, so estimated salad volume is 840 cm³. The salade grecque contains diced vegetables, feta cheese, olives, and dressing—essentially a mixed salad of raw vegetables and cheese. Packing factor is estimated around 0.6 due to diced pieces and some air gaps. No hidden layers because the salad appears evenly mixed in the container. Effective volume = 840 × 0.6 = 504 ml. Density for raw vegetables and salad components is about 0.5 g/ml typical for fresh salad, but considering feta cheese and olives slightly denser, an average estimate of 0.7 g/ml is reasonable. Low-high weight range considering packing factor uncertainty (0.5-0.7) and volume fill (60-80%) gives approximately 420-588 grams. Typical portion for a salad like this is between 300-500 grams, making the midpoint 504 grams plausible. The 90% container limit is about 1080 grams max, so the estimate is well within physical limits. Therefore, estimating about 500 grams for the salade grecque is reasonable."
xjvrtk,séré maigre,145.0,305,160.0,2.753055654444049,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/6d7c5913-406a-449c-a95d-dae1cff11f27,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'séré maigre,' seen here as a creamy mixture in a bowl. Reference objects: the spoon's bowl is about 4 cm wide, typical for a teaspoon, and the woven placemat strands suggest the bowl's diameter is around 12 cm. Geometry: the bowl contains approximately a circular area of 12 cm diameter (radius 6 cm) and the fill height is estimated at about 3 cm since it’s a shallow bowl and the food is not overflowing. Geometric volume = π × 6² × 3 ≈ 339 cm³. Packing factor: the food is a smooth mixture (like yogurt), so 1.0 (no air gaps). Hidden-layer multiplier: not applicable since this is a continuous smooth mixture. Effective volume = 339 × 1.0 = 339 ml. Density: 'séré maigre' (a type of low-fat quark or fresh cheese) is similar to thick yogurt or purée, density about 0.9 g/ml. Estimated weight = 339 × 0.9 ≈ 305 grams. Low-high range considering fill height uncertainty ±0.5 cm: volume range from ≈283 ml to ≈394 ml, weight range roughly 255 g to 355 g. Plausibility checks: typical single-portion dairy pot is around 150 g, but this bowl appears to contain about double a standard yogurt pot portion, which is plausible for a personal meal serving. The bowl is not overflowing, so the 90% container capacity is around 340 ml, matching the estimate well. Conclusion: about 300 g of 'séré maigre' is reasonable."
wrah5h,"légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)",198.0,42,156.0,3.665361338554646,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/5e117510-fc82-4a06-a502-12983d55aac5,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Reference objects include the plate, estimated at about 26 cm in diameter. The visible vegetables portion covers an approximate area of 8 cm by 6 cm on the plate. Assuming a fill height of around 2.5 cm due to the relatively flat pile typical of sautéed vegetables, the geometric volume is 8 × 6 × 2.5 = 120 cm³. Since the vegetables are a loose pile with some air gaps, a packing factor of 0.5 is used. The pile does not appear very thick or layered, so no hidden-layer multiplier is applied (multiplier = 1). Effective volume is therefore 120 × 0.5 × 1 = 60 cm³. Density for cooked vegetables is about 0.6–0.8 g/cm³; we take a midpoint of 0.7 g/cm³. Multiplying effective volume by density gives a weight range of 60 × 0.6 = 36 g (low) to 60 × 0.8 = 48 g (high). The midpoint is 42 g. Typical single portion weight for sautéed vegetables like carrots and leeks ranges from 50 to 100 g, so this estimate is slightly lower but plausible given moderate portion size. The 90% container limit is not exceeded considering the plate size and portion size. This all confirms the estimate is reasonable."
ppf8hc,carotte,182.0,34,148.0,3.1963925477631423,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/586e0d02-4ce2-4d7f-8ebb-a46598eb749c,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Reference object: dessert plate approx. 20 cm diameter. The carotte (carrot) slices are spread on about 8 cm by 6 cm area on the plate. Estimated thickness per slice is about 1 cm. Carrot is cut into slices approximately 1 cm thick, about 13 slices visible, total volume approximately 8 cm × 6 cm × 1 cm = 48 cm^3 geometrically if considering all slices combined. Packing factor for solid carrot slices is close to 1 since slices are whole and dense. No hidden-layer multiplier is applied since slices are single-layer. Density of cooked carrot is about 0.7 g/ml (0.7 g/cm^3). Effective volume = 48 cm^3 × 1 × 1 = 48 cm^3. Weight estimate = 48 × 0.7 = 33.6 grams. Low-high range by allowing ±20% volume uncertainty: approx. 27–40 grams. Typical portion size of sliced cooked carrot on plate is roughly 30–50 grams, so this is plausible. The plate's capacity and food amount fits well within physical limits as only about 1/4 of plate area is covered. Hence, final estimate is consistent and reasonable."
8japfq,"pizza champignons, olives, courgettes",183.0,46,137.0,2.975080099679601,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/9ac9736b-e0d1-4862-9981-1f47f8109d18,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Reference object: dessert plate approximately 20 cm in diameter. The pizza slices are placed on this plate, and their sizes fit roughly a half pizza. Assuming a whole pizza diameter of about 22-24 cm, each slice is approximately one eighth of the pizza. Geometric volume estimate: pizza thickness about 1-1.5 cm including crust height, visible slice length about 10 cm (half the plate diameter), width about 8 cm at base tapering to a point. Approximating slice area as a triangle: (10 cm * 8 cm) / 2 = 40 cm². Volume = 40 cm² * 1.3 cm thickness = 52 cm³ (conservative average thickness due to toppings and baked dough). Packing factor: this is a solid but porous food with cheese, vegetables, and dough, so roughly 0.85 to account for air pockets and cheese stretch. No hidden layer since pizza toppings are a single layer. Effective volume = 52 cm³ * 0.85 = 44.2 cm³. Density: pizza with cheese and vegetable toppings is dense about 1.0 to 1.1 g/cm³; using 1.05 g/cm³ as a middle value. Weight estimate = 44.2 cm³ * 1.05 g/cm³ = 46.4 g per slice. The plate holds four slices visible; from which one slice is target. Checking plausibility: typical pizza slice weight is around 80-130 g, but this pizza seems thin crust and light toppings, so slightly less is reasonable. The 46.4 g is therefore an estimate for this particular slice. Also, the total pizza (8 slices * 46.4) gives ~370 g, which is plausible for a thin vegetable pizza. The maximum capacity of the dessert plate (area πr² ≈ 314 cm², height about 2 cm reasonable for a slice stack) is approximately 628 cm³, so our slice is well below food volume capacity (about 7%). This supports the plausibility of the estimate."

Reference object: dinner plate approximately 27 cm diameter. The vegetables (courgette and onion) appear to occupy an area about 9 cm by 7 cm on the plate. The layer is roughly 1.5 cm deep, typical for sautéed vegetables. This gives a geometric volume of 9 cm × 7 cm × 1.5 cm = 94.5 cm³. The vegetables are cooked but not densely packed, so I use a packing factor of 0.7. No hidden layers since it is a flat single layer sauté. Effective volume = 94.5 × 0.7 = 66.15 cm³. Density for cooked vegetables is about 0.7 g/cm³. Estimated weight = 66.15 × 0.7 = 46.3 g. Typical sautéed vegetable single portion size is 50–100 g, so this is a bit on the low side but plausible for a side portion. The container (plate) can hold much more, so no volume limit concerns. I conclude the cooked vegetables weigh approximately 46 g."

Reference objects: dessert plate (approx. 20 cm diameter), fork (approx. 20 cm long). The croissants au jambon are two medium-sized croissants on the plate. Typically, a single croissant au jambon weighs around 80-100 g based on standard bakery sizes. Geometric volume: each croissant is approx. 10 cm long, 5 cm wide, and about 4 cm high, giving a rough geometric volume of 200 cm³ each (10×5×4). Packing factor: these are solid, dense pastries, so around 0.9 to account for air pockets. Hidden-layer multiplier: none, as whole croissants are visible. Effective volume per croissant: 200 × 0.9 = 180 cm³. Density of croissant au jambon estimated around 0.8–0.9 g/cm³ (pastry with ham). Weight per croissant: volume × density = 180 × 0.85 (mid) = 153 g. Two croissants = 306 g. This seems high, so rechecking typical portions: bakery croissants au jambon usually range from 80-100 g each. The large volume estimate likely overestimates height or width. Adjusting size to 9×4×3 cm = 108 cm³ geometric volume × 0.9 = 97 cm³ effective volume. Weight = 97 × 0.85 ≈ 82 g each, thus two croissants ≈164 g total. Sanity check against plate capacity: plate usage is reasonable. Midpoint weight 82 g aligns well with typical single croissant weight and fits plate capacity. Thus, for the target 'croissants au jambon' weight estimate for both croissants is 164 g."

Low-high range from volume and density uncertainty (~0.6-0.8 g/ml) = 82.5 - 110 g. Typical portion size for blueberries is about 100 g. The container capacity at 90% fullness = 275 × 0.9 = 247.5 ml or about 173 g at 0.7 g/ml, so estimated portion is well below container max.

Reference objects: dinner plate approx 26-28 cm diameter visible under the salad plate which is approx 20 cm diameter (dessert plate size). Geometric volume: the tomato slices cover nearly the entire 20 cm plate, estimated approx 18 cm diameter area filled. Thickness is about 1.5 cm average (sliced tomatoes stacked one layer). Volume = π × (9 cm)^2 × 1.5 cm ≈ 381 cm³. No hidden layer multiplier needed as tomatoes are sliced and laid flat in a single layer. Packing factor: sliced whole tomatoes are dense and close packed, packing factor about 0.85 (to account for irregular shapes and minor gaps). Effective volume = 381 × 0.85 = 324 cm³. Density for raw vegetables like tomatoes is about 0.9 g/ml (close to water density but slightly less dense). Estimated weight = 324 g. Low-high range from volume × density uncertainty: ±10% → 290–360 g. Sanity check versus typical single portion of sliced tomatoes on a side plate (usually 150–250 g): this is a generous portion but plausible as a full salad plate. Also below 90% of the plate capacity volume limit. Therefore, reasonable estimate is around 320 g, midpoint of range fits well with visual and typical portion size."

Reference object: The dessert plate, ~20 cm diameter. The tart slice sits on it and occupies roughly 1/6th to 1/7th of the plate area, estimating slice length ~9 cm, width ~5 cm. Thickness: Cream and fruit layer looks about 3 cm max. Geometric volume = 9 cm × 5 cm × 3 cm = 135 cm³. The surface fruit layer (strawberries and currants) is somewhat loose with air gaps, so packing factor ~0.6. No hidden layers, the tart slice is flat. Effective volume = 135 × 0.6 = 81 cm³. Density: Tarte aux fraises consists mostly of pastry, cream, and fruit; approximating density as moderate solid, ~0.9 g/cm³ (similar to cream and fruit combined). Weight estimate = 81 × 0.9 = 73 g (rounded). Typical single slice from such tart usually weighs about 70-100 g, plausible. Considering the plate size and slice proportion, 90% capacity check is fulfilled. Low-high range with packing factor uncertainty (0.5 to 0.7) and density (0.8–1.0) gives approx 60-95 g, midpoint fitting typical portion and capacity checks."

Reference object: dinner plate approximately 27 cm diameter. The pasta salad is a small leftover portion in the center, roughly 8 cm by 6 cm visible area. Estimated fill height is about 1 cm as the pasta is spread thin. Geometric volume = length × width × height = 8 cm × 6 cm × 1 cm = 48 cm³. Packing factor for pasta salad, which includes pasta, corn, tomatoes and herbs, is about 0.7 due to tight packing but some air gaps. No hidden layer assumed as pile looks single-layered and thin. Effective volume = 48 × 0.7 × 1 = 33.6 cm³ (ml). Density for cooked pasta with vegetables typically 0.7 g/ml due to water and low density filler vegetables. Weight estimate is volume × density = 33.6 × 0.7 = 23.5 g. Low-high range from uncertainty in height (0.8 to 1.2 cm) and packing (0.6 to 0.8) gives about 20 to 28 g. Typical single serving of pasta salad is about 150 to 200 g, this is a small leftover portion, so the value fits plausibility. Also well below the 90% of dinner plate capacity (about 1100 ml × 0.9 = 990 g max). Thus the estimated weight of this leftover pasta salad is about 24 g."

The target food is 'salade de carotte, mais, tomates,' which is located in the center of the plate. The plate is a dinner plate, about 27 cm in diameter. The salad covers roughly a quarter of the plate area, about 13 cm long and 8 cm wide. The salad is spread thin on the plate, with an estimated fill height of about 2.5 cm. Geometric volume = length × width × height = 13 × 8 × 2.5 = 260 cm³. The salad includes shredded carrot, corn, and cherry tomatoes. This is a loose, raw vegetable salad with some creamy dressing, so density is estimated at 0.4 g/ml (typical for raw leafy vegetables and salads). Packing factor is about 0.6 given the loose arrangement and dressing. The salad is spread out, no extra hidden layer applies, so hidden-layer multiplier = 1. Effective volume = 260 × 0.6 × 1 = 156 ml. Weight estimate = volume × density = 156 × 0.4 = 62.4 g. Low-high range with packing and height uncertainty could be approximately 50-75 g. Typical single-portion weight for this type of salad is about 60-100 g, so the estimate fits within this plausibility range. The plate can contain up to 90% of its capacity in volume; given the plate radius of ~13.5 cm, max volume for food assuming 3 cm height is roughly 3 × π × 13.5² ≈ 1720 cm³, 90% is about 1550 cm³, so 156 ml is well below the container's limit.

Reference object: the wooden tabletop texture suggests a normal-sized stack of crispbread without a formal plate, but we can use an average hand width for scale of about 8-10 cm. Each Blevita crispbread square is roughly 9 cm x 6 cm and about 0.5 cm thick. There are 4 units stacked. Geometric volume for one crispbread = 9 cm x 6 cm x 0.5 cm = 27 cm3. For 4 units stacked, height = 2 cm approximately, so volume = 9 x 6 x 2 = 108 cm3. Packing factor is 1 because they are solid, stacked crackers with no air gaps between layers. No hidden layer multiplier is needed because we see all pieces distinctly and they are stacked neatly. Density of Blevita cracker (dry baked crispbread) is approximately 0.8 g/cm3 given its porosity but solid form. Therefore, effective volume is 108 cm3, density 0.8 g/cm3, giving a weight estimate of 108 x 0.8 = 86.4 g. Low-high range considering uncertainty in thickness (between 1.5 cm and 2.5 cm height for 4 crackers) gives 9 x 6 x 1.5 = 81 cm3 to 9 x 6 x 2.5 = 135 cm3, or 64.8 g to 108 g weight range. Typical single Blevita crispbread weight is about 20-25 g each; 4 pieces hence about 80-100 g, fitting well with our estimate. No container capacity to check here since it’s a dry stack on table. Thus, the estimated weight is plausible and fits expected portion size."

Reference objects are a dessert plate (about 20 cm diameter), a standard knife (about 20 cm long) and a fork. The visible slice of 'tarte à la rhubarbe' occupies roughly a central portion of the plate and measures about 12 cm in length and 7 cm in width. The typical height or thickness of such a tart slice can be conservatively estimated at 2.5 cm. Therefore, the geometric volume is approximately length × width × height = 12 cm × 7 cm × 2.5 cm = 210 cm³. As it is a baked tart with a dough base and rhubarb filling, the packing factor might be close to 0.9 due to minimal air gaps. There is no visible extra hidden layer. The density for such a tart, mainly a mix of cooked rhubarb (density ~0.7 g/cm³) and pastry (denser, close to 1 g/cm³), can be averaged at around 0.9 g/cm³. Multiplying geometric volume by packing factor: 210 × 0.9 = 189 cm³ effective volume. Weight estimate = effective volume × density = 189 × 0.9 = 170 grams. A typical single tart slice weighs between 150-200 grams, so 170g fits well the known typical portion weight. The 90% container limit is less relevant since this is a slice, but as the slice is a fraction of a full tart (~1.5-2 kg total), estimation is plausible. The low-high weight range from ±20% is approximately 136–204 g, consistent with typical slices. Hence, 170 g is a reasonable estimate."

The target food 'courgette et oignons' is located on the left side of the container. Reference objects: the glass container on a wooden table, likely standard size around 15 cm by 15 cm. The cooked zucchini and onion appear spread flat, covering roughly half the container's base (approx. 7.5 cm by 15 cm). Thickness is shallow, estimated max fill height 3 cm as it is low and cooked vegetables tend to compact. Geometric volume = 7.5 cm × 15 cm × 3 cm = 337.5 cm3. Packing factor for cooked vegetables is taken as 0.7 (moderate density, some air gaps). No significant hidden layers, so hidden-layer multiplier = 1. Density for cooked vegetables is about 0.7 g/ml (or g/cm3). Effective volume = 337.5 × 0.7 × 1 = 236.25 ml. Estimated weight range low-high ±20%: 189 - 283 grams. Plausibility: typical cooked vegetable portion is about 150-250 g, and container 90% capacity for this part is about 340 ml × 90% = 306 ml, so 236 ml fits well under the physical limit. Midpoint 236 g aligns well with both typical portion weight and container capacity, so estimate is sound."

The target food is 'sauce bolognese', located on top of the pile of pasta and beneath the grated cheese. The dish is served on a standard dinner plate, approximately 27 cm in diameter. The sauce roughly covers an area about 12 cm by 7 cm on the plate. Assuming the sauce is spread with a fill height of about 1 cm because it looks relatively thin and smooth. The geometric volume is therefore approximately 12 cm × 7 cm × 1 cm = 84 cubic cm (ml). There are no hidden layers since the sauce layer is visible and fairly flat. The packing factor for sauce is effectively 1 (liquid/semiliquid, no air gaps). Density for bolognese sauce is typically between 0.8 and 0.9 g/ml due to meat and vegetable content. Using a density range of 0.8–0.9 g/ml, the weight estimate is between 67 g and 76 g. The midpoint is about 71.5 g. Checking plausibility: typical portion size for bolognese sauce ranges from 60 to 120 g, so this fits well. The plate can physically hold well over 200 ml of food in this area and height, so the 90% capacity limit is not exceeded. Therefore, the estimate is reasonable and fits the portion size expectation and container size limits."

The target food is œufs brouillés (scrambled eggs), located on the left upper half of the plate. The plate appears to be a standard dinner plate, approximately 27 cm in diameter. The scrambled eggs cover an area roughly 10 cm by 7 cm. The eggs are loosely piled in one layer, with some small thickness visible. Using a conservative fill height of about 2.5 cm for the scrambled eggs on the plate. Geometric volume = 10 cm × 7 cm × 2.5 cm = 175 cm³. Since the eggs are loosely piled, a packing factor of 0.6 is reasonable to account for air gaps. No hidden layers multiplier is applied because the eggs are spread with visible gaps. Effective volume = 175 × 0.6 = 105 cm³. Density of scrambled eggs is about 0.8 g/ml (0.8 g/cm³). Thus, estimated weight = 105 × 0.8 = 84 grams. Low-high range accounting for uncertainty in fill height (2-3 cm) and packing factor (0.5-0.7): volume range 140 cm³ to 210 cm³, effective volume range 70 to 147 cm³, weight range 56 to 118 grams roughly. Typical portion of scrambled eggs usually falls between 70 to 120 grams, which fits well with this estimate. The weight is also well below 90% capacity of the plate area and physically plausible for the space taken. Therefore, the final estimate is ~84 grams."

Reference objects: small bowl (approx. 12 cm diameter) and wooden table pattern for scale. There are 4 strawberries visible in a small bowl. A typical strawberry weighs about 15-25 g depending on size. The strawberries here appear large, so average weight per strawberry is estimated at 20 g. Geometric volume: strawberries roughly approximate to an ellipsoid about 6 cm long, 4 cm wide, and 3 cm high each, volume ≈ 6 × 4 × 3 × 0.52 = about 37 ml each, total visible volume about 148 ml. Packing factor: as whole strawberries touch, packing factor is close to 1 for total volume estimation. Hidden-layer multiplier: none, all strawberries visible. Density: strawberries have a density close to water, about 0.9 g/ml. Effective mass = volume × density = 148 ml × 0.9 g/ml ≈ 133 grams total. Checking against count × average = 4 × 20 g = 80 g; volume-derived mass higher due to assumed volume shape and density. The lower value of 80 g is more consistent with typical portion sizes. Container capacity is much larger than required for 4 strawberries, so no constraint. Final estimated weight chosen near average of the two approaches, about 90 g, which fits typical portion and visible food amount."

The target food is 'pâtes' (pasta), located on the right side of the container mixed with sauce and topped with grated parmesan. The container is a standard stainless steel meal tray, approximately 20 cm by 12 cm in visible area for the pasta section. Reference objects include the metal container estimated at 20 cm width and a portion of grilled chicken roughly 10 cm long. Pasta is layered somewhat densely and covered with grated parmesan, with an estimated visible length about 12 cm and width about 10 cm. The pasta is piled but not very high, estimated fill height is 3 cm on the flat bottom. Packing factor for cooked pasta is about 0.7 (moderately packed), and no hidden layers assumed since pasta occupies a single consistent layer. Effective volume = 12 cm × 10 cm × 3 cm × 0.7 = 252 cm³. Density for cooked pasta (with sauce) is approximately 0.8 g/ml, therefore weight estimate is 252 × 0.8 = 202 grams. The typical portion size for cooked pasta is 150–200 g, and 90% maximum container capacity for pasta in that compartment (about 240 cm³ × 0.8 density = ~192 g) is close to this estimate. The estimate of about 200 g is consistent with both typical portion weight and container limits after considering sauce and cheese on top, so no major assumptions need adjusting."

The target food is 'pain' (bread), identified as two slices on a white dinner plate. The plate is about 27 cm diameter, the bread slices roughly 13 cm by 7 cm each. Typical single slices of bread weigh about 30-40 g. Calibrating scale using the dinner plate diameter (27 cm) as reference, each slice occupies an area about 13 x 7 cm, and thickness about 2 cm. Geometric volume per slice = 13 cm x 7 cm x 2 cm = 182 cm^3. The packing factor for bread is close to 1 (dense solid porous but mostly solid). No hidden layers. Density of bread is about 0.3-0.4 g/cm^3 because bread is porous. Effective volume = 182 cm^3 x 1 = 182 cm^3. Weight estimate = volume x density = 182 x 0.35 = 64 g per slice approx. Since there are two slices visible, total bread weight about 128 g. However, asked to estimate the weight of 'pain' as is, so total weight is about 128 g. Sanity check: typical sandwich slice weights are 30-40 g, so two slices would be 60-80 g, a bit less than the volume-density calculation due to porous structure and air holes. Also, considering the visible slices may be somewhat thick or thin, a reasonable final estimate for both slices is 90-110 g, averaging about 100 g. This fits plausibility checks for typical bread slice weights and fits well within the 90% capacity of the plate surface area that they occupy. Thus, a balanced weight estimate of the visible pain (both slices on plate) is about 100 g."

Reference objects: the open book and woven textile stripes suggest the container is a small produce punnet, typical for cherry tomatoes. Common Swiss cherry tomato punnets come in 250 g or 500 g sizes. The punnet here is approximately 20 cm long and 8 cm wide by estimation relative to the book's open page dimensions. Geometric volume is roughly length × width × estimated height: 20 cm × 8 cm × 4 cm (height slightly above the punnet edge, tomatoes piled to around this height). The tomatoes are quite tightly packed with one visible layer but some piled above the base, so a hidden-layer multiplier of 1.5 is reasonable. Packing factor for cherry tomatoes is about 0.6 due to air gaps. Effective volume = 20 × 8 × 4 × 0.6 × 1.5 = 576 cm³. Density for raw fruits like cherry tomatoes is about 0.95 g/ml (close to water). Weight estimate = 576 × 0.95 ≈ 547 g. Typical punnet weights are 250 g or 500 g, and 547 g fits well with a large 500 g punnet plus some slight overfill. The 90% capacity check with the box volume matches this range. Low-high weight range considering uncertainty in height (3.5 to 4.5 cm) and multiplier (1.3 to 1.7): volume range 20×8×3.5×0.6×1.3=436 up to 20×8×4.5×0.6×1.7=734 cm³; weight range 415-698 g. Midpoint around 550 g is plausible and consistent with common packaging sizes. Hence, estimated weight is approximately 550 g."

The target food is a 'branche de chocolat' which appears to be a chocolate-covered snack bar similar to a KitKat or similar Swiss chocolate product. Common Swiss single-unit chocolate bars like KitKat weigh around 41.5 g, and smaller Kinder bars weigh 21 g. The shape and size suggest it is a single snack bar about 12-13 cm long, approx. 2.5-3 cm wide, and about 1.5-2 cm thick. Reference object: the wooden table grain and surface texture imply typical scale, and the bar length is roughly half the width of a human hand (about 8-10 cm), so around 12 cm long is plausible. Geometric volume approximated as a rounded rectangular prism: length 12 cm × width 3 cm × height 1.8 cm = 64.8 cm³. The packing factor for dense solids (chocolate with nuts or crisped rice) is effectively 1 (very dense, no hollow air gaps inside chocolate). Hidden-layer multiplier not used as this is a single solid piece. Density of chocolate and similar dense solids is about 1.2 g/ml (chocolate is slightly denser than water). Thus, estimated weight = 64.8 cm³ × 1.2 g/cm³ = approx. 77.8 g. Low-high range considering size uncertainty (±10%) and density uncertainty (1.1-1.3 g/cm³) => 57 g to 86 g. Plausibility check: Common chocolate bar weights are 20-45 g typically, but this 'branche' is longer and thicker, so about 70-80 g is plausible. The physical size fits well on a table and matches typical snack bar sizes. The container capacity check is not applicable as it is unpackaged and discrete. Final estimate aligns well with the expected weight of a snack chocolate bar of this size and composition."

The pieces of colrave (kohlrabi) occupy about 18 cm by 10 cm surface area with an estimated average thickness of 1.5 cm (cut pieces lying flat, not piled). Geometric volume = 18 cm × 10 cm × 1.5 cm = 270 cm³. Packing factor for cut raw vegetables is about 0.5, since the pieces are irregular and loosely arranged. Hidden-layer multiplier is 1.0 because no visible layering or piling is evident. Effective volume = 270 × 0.5 × 1.0 = 135 cm³. Density of raw colrave (raw crunchy vegetable) is about 0.5 g/cm³. Weight estimate = 135 × 0.5 = 67.5 g. Low-high range considering packing and depth variation might be 50–85 g. Typical single portion of raw colrave cut pieces is roughly 60–100 g, so this fits well. The container size (lid) would hold about 270 g if fully filled (at 90%, 243 g max), so the estimate is well within the 90% container capacity."

Reference objects: dessert plate (~20 cm diameter). The plate's radius is about 10 cm, giving a surface area of approximately 314 cm² (π × 10²). The blueberries (myrtilles) occupy roughly one-quarter of the plate's visible surface, about 75 cm². Visible blueberries number around 14, piled loosely in one layer. Since berries are small and loosely packed, assume a packing factor around 0.5. We estimate a hidden-layer multiplier of 1.3 because there are some overlapped berries but not a full second layer. The visible height of the blueberries is around 2.5 cm. Geometric volume for myrtilles = area × height = 75 cm² × 2.5 cm = 187.5 cm³. Applying packing factor and hidden layer multiplier: effective volume = 187.5 × 0.5 × 1.3 = 121.875 cm³. Density of raw berries is 0.6–0.7 g/ml (g/cm³); using 0.65 g/ml. Weight estimate = 121.875 × 0.65 = ~79 grams. Low-high range considering volume and density uncertainties: 60–90 grams. Typical portion of blueberries in Swiss settings is about 125–150 g per punnet, so this is roughly half a portion. The 90% physical limit of the plate area × height (full plate with berries) is larger (~440 g at density 0.65), this serving is clearly below that limit, so plausible. Conclusion: estimate is consistent with typical portion expectations and container capacity."

Geometric volume is 12 × 6 × 2 = 144 cm³. No hidden layer, packing factor 1.0 (solid piece). Density for cooked chicken is about 1.0 g/cm³. Effective volume = 144 × 1.0 = 144 ml. Weight estimate based on volume and density is about 144 g. This fits well within typical portion weight and below the 90% container capacity limit (90% of plate area filled to about 3 cm yields a much larger capacity). Low-high weight range ±20%: 115-173 g. The midpoint 144 g matches typical portion range for chicken breast. Therefore, the estimated weight of 'poulet' is 144 grams."

Reference objects: the blue bowl and the surface it is on, estimated diameter of bowl ~18 cm (medium bowl). The galettes millet, haricots noirs, maïs are five small round patties on one half of the bowl. Each galette's diameter is approximately 6 cm, thickness about 1 cm. Geometric volume for one galette ~ π × (3 cm)^2 × 1 cm ≈ 28 cm³. For 5 galettes total geometric volume ~ 140 cm³. These patties are dense, compact, so packing factor ~1.0 with no hidden layers since they lie flat and are separate. Density typical for such legume-based patties around 1.1 g/cm³ (dense solids). Effective volume = geometric volume × packing factor = 140 cm³ × 1.0 = 140 cm³. Weight = volume × density = 140 × 1.1 = 154 g. Low-high range considering thickness ±0.3 cm giving volume range ~112-168 cm³: weight range ~123-185 g. Plausibility check: typical millet + beans galette weighs about 25-35 g each, so 5 × 30 g = 150 g typical portion, consistent with estimate. The bowl can hold about 90% of ~1000 ml max volume = 900 ml, so 154 g well below container capacity. Therefore, weight estimate is plausible and consistent."

A typical small apple weighs around 100-150 grams. Assuming the apple is spherical, approximate diameter is 7 cm, volume ≈ 4/3 * π * (3.5)^3 ≈ 180 cm³. Apple density is close to water, about 0.8 g/cm³ due to air pockets and flesh. Multiplying volume by density gives an estimated weight around 144 grams, fitting within typical small apple weights. No packaging or hidden layers to consider. The weight fits plausible typical portion weights and is reasonable for a whole apple of that visual size."

Reference objects: dessert plate approximately 20 cm diameter. The salade de pâtes portion is on the plate's lower left section, roughly occupying an area 7 cm by 5 cm, with an estimated height (depth) of about 2 cm since it is loosely piled but not heaping. Geometric volume = length × width × height = 7 cm × 5 cm × 2 cm = 70 cm³. Packing factor for cooked pasta salad (loose, including vegetables) estimated at 0.6 due to air gaps. No hidden layers multiplier applied because the pasta salad is shallow and visible. Effective volume = 70 cm³ × 0.6 = 42 cm³. Density chosen is for cooked pasta/vegetables: 0.7 g/cm³ (mid-range of 0.6–0.8). Estimated weight = 42 cm³ × 0.7 g/cm³ = 29.4 g. Low-high range considering volume and density uncertainties (±20%) gives approximately 24–35 g. Typical single portion of pasta salad is around 100–150 g, so this portion is visibly smaller. Checked against plate capacity (dessert plate) and visible quantity, it matches a small side portion comfortably below 90% of plate capacity. Recalculated assumptions to fit plausibility: the estimate represents a small serving under typical portion, which is plausible given the presence of other foods. Therefore the estimate is sound."

Based on physical dimensions and comparison to the croissant, the apple's height is about 7.5 to 8.5 cm and width around 6-7 cm, consistent with a medium apple. No packaging is present and the apple is whole. The table width is not exactly defined, but the usual apple size suffices as a typical portion weight. We do not require geometric volume or packing factors since it is a single unit and no hidden layering. Density of apple is about 0.8 g/ml (typical for raw fruit). Using the common estimated single apple weight range as 150–200 g, this fits plausibility given the apple size and client's known portion sizes. There is no container limit applied here since the apple is on a table. The midpoint weight estimate is 175 g, within typical portion and realistic for the size seen.

Hidden-layer multiplier: Pieces are lying flat, no stacked layers, so multiplier = 1.0. Effective volume: 225 cm³ × 0.7 × 1.0 = 157.5 cm³. Density: Pears are mostly water, so roughly 0.85–0.9 g/ml; use 0.9 g/ml for ripe pear flesh. Weight range: 157.5 × 0.85 = 134 g (low) to 157.5 × 0.9 = 142 g (high). Midpoint ≈ 138 g. Typical whole medium pear weight is 150–200 g, this is about 70–90% of a whole pear. Container limit is 520 g total (0.52 l × 1 g/ml), 90% of which is 468 g, so this weight fits well under that limit. Therefore, about 138 g for these pear pieces is plausible and logical given the portion size and container volume."

Reference objects: the white plate is a dinner plate approximately 27 cm diameter. The poivron (sliced red bell pepper) portion measures about 8 cm long and 3 cm wide. On a flat plate, max fill height for slices is about 1 cm (typical single layer). Geometric volume = 8 cm × 3 cm × 1 cm = 24 cm³. Packing factor for sliced raw vegetables is about 0.6 (some air gaps between slices). No hidden-layer multiplier is used since slices are flat and visible in a single layer. Effective volume = 24 cm³ × 0.6 = 14.4 cm³. Density of raw vegetables like bell pepper is about 0.5 g/cm³. Estimated weight = 14.4 × 0.5 = 7.2 grams. Low-high range could vary ±30% due to slice thickness and packing: low ~5 g, high ~9 g. Typical portion of sliced raw bell pepper is about 30–50 g for a full half pepper, so 7 g is a plausible small serving here, consistent with visual portion on plate. The plate area can easily hold this portion, so the 90% capacity limit is not close to being exceeded."

Geometric volume: visible carrots pieces spread approximately over 6 cm length, 3 cm width, 0.5 cm thickness (since they're thin slices), volume = 6×3×0.5 = 9 cm³. Packing factor: carrots are sliced and scattered loosely among other ingredients, so packing factor = 0.6. Hidden-layer multiplier: no visible pile of multiple layers, so 1.0. Effective volume = 9 × 0.6 × 1.0 = 5.4 cm³. Density of cooked vegetables (carrots) = 0.7 g/cm³ (average). Low-high range from volume × density with ±20% uncertainty: 5.4×0.8=4.32 g to 5.4×1.2=6.48 g. Typical portion weights for carrot slices in mixed dishes are around 20-40 g, but carrot is clearly a minor ingredient here. The container volume is roughly 450 ml; 90% capacity is 405 g total food. The estimated range (about 4-6 g) is reasonable as carrots are a small part of the dish. The estimate fits plausibility checks given portion size and visible quantity."

Assuming butter spread thickness about 2-3 mm (0.2-0.3 cm), volumetric estimate = 160 cm² * 0.25 cm = 40 cm³. Butter packing factor is 1 (solid paste, no air gaps). No hidden layers. Density of butter ~0.9 g/ml. Effective volume = 40 cm³ * 1 = 40 ml. Weight = volume * density = 40 * 0.9 = 36 grams. Plausibility check: typical portion of butter spread on 4 small slices is about 30-40 grams, consistent with estimate. 90% capacity limit of plate irrelevant since volume is much smaller and the butter is clearly thinly spread. Low-high range ±25% gives 27-45 g. Midpoint 36 g matches typical portion size, so estimate is reasonable."

The yogurt pot visible has a standard size and is unopened. Calibrating scale: the yogurt pot is approximately standard small yogurt size, corresponding to about 6-7 cm in height and roughly 6 cm in diameter. Geometric volume estimate (cylinder): π × (3 cm)^2 × 6.5 cm ≈ 184 cm³ or ml. Given the typical pot size, and based on Swiss products, the maximum capacity is about 150 g, which aligns closely with the 90% fill of this volume. Density of plain yogurt is approximately 1 g/ml. Packing factor is not relevant here as this is a single container. No hidden layers apply for this packaged yogurt. Effective volume corresponds closely to the actual volume of yogurt inside. Low-high range: the pot is full and typical size suggests 140-160 g with midpoint 150 g. Plausibility check aligns perfectly with typical portion size of 150 g for Swiss yogurt pots, and well within container capacity. Therefore, estimated weight is 150 g."

Geometric volume for épautre cuit portion (left compartment): roughly 15 cm × 7.5 cm × 3 cm (conservative fill height) = 337.5 cm³. Packing factor: épautre (cooked grains) are dense but with some air gaps so 0.7 is appropriate. No hidden layer multiplier is necessary as grains sit roughly single layer and visible throughout. Effective volume = 337.5 × 0.7 = 236.25 ml (since 1 ml ≈ 1 cm³). Density: cooked grains like spelt typically have about 0.8 g/ml density. Estimated weight = 236.25 × 0.8 ≈ 189 g. Low-high range accounting for packing and height uncertainty (3±0.5 cm): volume range 281 to 394 cm³ × 0.7 × 0.8 = 157 to 220 g. Plausibility checks: Typical single cooked grain portion for spelt 150-200 g fits well with estimate, and 90% fill of container compartment volume confirms it is physically plausible (approx 0.9 × 15 × 7.5 × 5 = 506 ml max, 236 is less than half).

The rice portion is flat and spread out, about 1.5 cm high. Geometric volume = length × width × height = 9 cm × 6 cm × 1.5 cm = 81 cm³. Brown rice cooked density is roughly 0.8 g/ml (g/cm³) according to typical values for cooked grains. Packing factor for cooked rice is fairly dense, around 0.85 because the grains are fairly close but with some air pockets. No hidden-layer multiplier as rice is flatly placed in one layer. Effective volume = 81 × 0.85 = 68.85 cm³. Weight estimate = effective volume × density = 68.85 × 0.8 = 55 grams. Low-high range from 50g to 60g considering some measurement uncertainty in height and packing. Typical single portion of cooked rice is about 150-180 grams, so this portion is smaller but plausible as a reduced or light serving. The 90% plate capacity check is not applicable as rice is separate and only covers part of the plate. The estimate fits logical portion size for the visible amount on the plate.

The galettes are clearly inside the container, each about 6 cm in diameter and 1.5 cm thick each. Geometric volume for two galettes: 2 × (π × (3 cm)^2 × 1.5 cm) ≈ 2 × 42.4 cm^3 = 84.8 cm^3. Packing factor: as these are dense patties, use 0.9 for solid nonporous food. Hidden-layer multiplier: there is no hidden layer, the galettes are discrete and clearly visible. Effective volume = geometric volume (since packing inside each galette is dense and no hidden layers) × packing factor = 84.8 × 0.9 = 76.3 cm^3. Density: millet, corn, black beans cooked together would be mostly cooked legumes/pulses, so density approx 0.7 g/cm^3. Weight estimate = effective volume × density = 76.3 × 0.7 = 53.4 g. Low-high range considering ±20% volume and density variance: approx 43 g to 64 g. Plausibility check: Typical millet patties with legumes weigh about 25–40 g each, so two would be 50–80 g, fitting well with this estimate.

Reference object: The dinner plate is approximately 27 cm in diameter, and the bowl shown likely has a diameter around 20 cm (dessert plate size). The galettes millet haricots noirs maïs consist of three visible patties. Each patty is about 7 cm in diameter and around 1.5 cm thick (estimate from height relative to salad and mushrooms). Geometric volume for one patty is approximately: π × (3.5 cm)^2 × 1.5 cm ≈ 58 cm^3 per patty. For 3 patties, volume ≈ 174 cm^3. The galettes are dense solid-like food (grain and beans mixture), so density is about 1.0 g/ml (1 cm^3 = 1 g). Packing factor is 1.0 since patties are solid formed. No hidden layers multiplier is needed because discrete units are counted. Effective volume = 174 cm^3 × 1.0 = 174 g approximate. Typical portion size for such plant-based patties is approximately 50-70 g each, so 3 patties would be around 150-210 g, which aligns with this volume estimate. The bowl portion limit (estimated at 90% capacity) for a bowl approximately 20 cm in diameter and 5 cm deep is 0.9 × π × (10 cm)^2 × 5 cm ≈ 1413 cm^3 total volume, so 174 g is well within the capacity. Low-high weight range could span ±20% around 174 g to account for uncertainty in thickness, so about 140 g to 210 g. Midpoint fits typical portion weight and container size, so assumptions are reasonable."

The target food item is the salad, which contains green salad leaves, carrots, avocado, olive oil and vinegar dressing. It is served on a standard dinner plate around 27 cm in diameter. The salad covers an area roughly 15 cm by 10 cm. The salad is on a flat plate with an estimated fill height of about 3 cm given it is piled but not very dense, and there are visible leaves and pieces but no deep layering. To account for some layering, I apply a hidden-layer multiplier of 1.4. The geometric volume is thus approximately 15 cm × 10 cm × 3 cm = 450 cm³. Including the hidden layer this becomes 450 × 1.4 = 630 cm³. The salad is loose leafy vegetables with some avocado chunks and carrot slices, so a packing factor of about 0.6 seems reasonable to account for air gaps. Effective volume is therefore 630 × 0.6 = 378 cm³. Density for mixed raw leafy vegetables and avocado + carrots is chosen about 0.5 g/ml (0.5 g/cm³), as avocado and carrots raise the density above pure leafy greens but still below cooked vegetables. The weight estimate is then volume × density = 378 × 0.5 = 189 g. Considering uncertainty in fill height ±0.5 cm and packing factor ±0.1, a low-high range is about 150–230 g. Typical single portions of salad range from 100 g to 200 g, and this estimate fits well within that. Plate capacity supports this, given the salad occupies about half the plate surface with some height, well below 90% of plate volume. Hence the estimate is plausible and consistent."

The target food item is 'pillons de poulet,' which are chicken drumettes. These are discrete countable items, typically weighing between 20 and 35 grams each. There are 5 visible drumettes on the plate. The reference object is the dinner plate, which is approximately 27 cm in diameter. Comparing the drumettes to the plate, the size and thickness appear typical for cooked chicken drumettes. No significant hidden layers are apparent as the pieces are laid out flat. Therefore, the hidden-layer multiplier is 1. The drumettes are dense solids with density approximately 1 g/ml, so each estimated weight is close to typical weight per unit. Geometric volume calculations are not strictly necessary here due to discrete units, but size-to-weight aligns with the 20-35 g range per drumette. Total weight estimate is 5 pieces × (average 27.5 g) = 137.5 g. This fits well within typical portion sizes and container size limits (the plate can easily hold this quantity). Low-high range is approx 100-175 g considering ±30% variation per piece. Midpoint of 137.5 g is logically reasonable for this portion and fits the 90% container-capacity sanity check easily."

Reference objects: dessert plate (~20 cm diameter). Both tiramisu and forêt noir pieces are on the same plate. The tiramisu piece measures roughly 9 cm in length, 4 cm in width, and about 3 cm in height (conservative fill-height for dessert slice). Geometric volume = 9 x 4 x 3 = 108 cm³. Packing factor for this creamy/moist layered dessert is 0.9 (dense creamy layers with little air). No hidden layers as it's a single slice. Effective volume = 108 x 0.9 = 97.2 cm³ ~ 97 ml. Density chosen as 1.0 g/ml (desserts with cream, soaked sponge, roughly 1 g/ml). Low-high range = 85 - 110 g (accounting for layering and slight volume estimation uncertainty). Typical single-portion weight for tiramisu is about 100-120 g. The dessert plate has about 250-280 ml capacity; this piece occupies less than half of a third of this area, so 90% capacity is not exceeded. Midpoint (around 97 g) fits well within typical portion weight and 90% container capacity limit. Hence, 97 g is a well-grounded estimate."

Reference objects visible include a standard-size pen in the background and a document on a desk, giving a rough scale for the jar of about 7 cm in diameter and about 9 cm visible height of the contents. The jar is filled with a mixture that includes the target 'graine de chia' (chia seeds), soaked and mixed in with yogurt and other ingredients, so chia is dispersed within the mixture and not separate. Given that, direct volume measurement for chia alone is not possible from the image, but typical chia seed content in such a portion is about one tablespoon or 12 grams dry weight per serving. The container appears to be a small jar holding about 300 ml volume. The mixture is dense and relatively uniform; density of soaked chia seed mixtures is about 1 g/ml. Chia seeds are embedded in the mass, mixed with yogurt and liquids. Typically, chia seeds constitute roughly 10% of the mixture by weight in such recipes. Volume is roughly 300 ml, so estimated chia seed weight is about 30 grams. Plausibility: typical chia single-portion weight ranges 10-20 grams dry; soaked weight increases but dry content stays same. The 30 grams is a slightly high estimate of dry chia but accounts for soaked seeds and some expansion/swelling. Checking container capacity at 90% of 300 ml is 270 g max, chia alone would not exceed this. Based on visual and logical deduction, the estimate is consistent."

The meat piece appears approximately 8 cm long and 5 cm wide with a thickness about 1.5 cm (typical for a cooked meat patty). The geometric volume is length × width × height = 8 cm × 5 cm × 1.5 cm = 60 cm³. Meat density is generally ≥ 1 g/ml; I use 1.1 g/ml to allow for moisture loss during cooking. The packing factor is 1 since this is a solid piece, no air gaps. No hidden layers since it's a single piece. Effective volume = 60 cm³. Weight estimate = volume × density = 60 × 1.1 = 66 g. Typical single cooked meat portion ranges 60-100 g, also fits well within the plate capacity (27 cm plate, max 90% fill for all food). Plate has other foods but meat only occupies about 15% of real surface, so 66 g is reasonable and balanced with total food. Low-high weight range from 50 to 80 g considering slight size and thickness uncertainties. Midpoint 66 g matches typical portion and plate context very well."

The target food is 'tomate', visible in the middle of the container, sliced. The container can be approximated as a small lunch box about 15 cm long and 9 cm wide. The tomatoes fill roughly a 13 cm × 5 cm area, with a conservative fill-height of 1.5 cm (tomato slices are thin). Geometric volume = 13 cm × 5 cm × 1.5 cm = 97.5 cm³. Tomatoes are basic raw vegetables with density ≈ 0.5 g/ml. The tomato slices are fairly tightly packed but with visible air gaps, so we use a packing factor of 0.6. No hidden layers are visible because these are flat slices in a single layer. Effective volume = 97.5 × 0.6 = 58.5 ml. Estimated weight = 58.5 × 0.5 = 29.25 g. Typical single serving weight for sliced tomatoes is around 30-60 g which fits well with this estimate. The container's capacity for the whole content is about 15 cm × 9 cm × 5 cm deep ≈ 675 cm³, and 90% is about 608 g for water density. Our estimate (around 30 g) is well below this maximum capacity. The low-high range, considering uncertainty in density (0.4-0.6) and packing (0.5-0.7), ranges from about 20 to 40 g, centering near 30 g. Both size and typical portion plausibility checks pass."

The target food is 'salade de céleri', located in the bottom right corner of the plate. The plate is a square white dinner plate, approximately 26-28 cm in width. Using the plate as reference, the portion of celery salad occupies roughly a 6 cm by 6 cm area and is piled to about 3 cm height. Geometric volume is 6 × 6 × 3 = 108 cm³. Given the shredded nature of celery salad, it is loose with air gaps, so a packing factor of 0.5 is appropriate. The salad is piled but not very high, so a hidden-layer multiplier of 1.3 is applied to account for hidden depth inside the pile. Effective volume = 108 × 0.5 × 1.3 = 70.2 ml. Density for raw leafy vegetables / salads is 0.2–0.5 g/ml, and since this is a creamy celery root salad, I select 0.4 g/ml as a medium density. Thus, estimated weight range is low: 108 × 0.4 × 0.5 × 1.1 = ~23 g (assuming slight variation), high: 108 × 0.4 × 0.5 × 1.5 = ~32 g (adjusting hidden-layer multiplier max). Typical single portion for a celery root salad is about 40–60 g; the plate size and portion shown suggests roughly half a typical serving, so 25–35 g is realistic. The plate maximum capacity is about 650 g (total 26 cm plate area × max fill height 3 cm × 90% fill), the celery salad portion is well below 90% limit. The midpoint estimate ~28 g fits well with both typical portion and container capacity checks."

The target food is 'asperges' (asparagus). The asparagus spears are loose, unpackaged, visible on a white dinner plate (≈ 27 cm diameter). Using the plate diameter for scale, each asparagus spear is about 15-18 cm long and about 1-1.2 cm thick on average. There are roughly 7 spears lying parallel. Typical single serving weight of cooked asparagus is about 100-150 g per 100g portion roughly 7-10 spears. Scale calibration: plate diameter 27 cm, asparagus length 15-18 cm. Geometric volume of one spear approximated as a cylinder: length 16 cm, diameter 1.1 cm, volume = π × (0.55 cm)^2 × 16 cm ≈ 15.2 cm³ per spear. Multiply by 7 spears = 106.4 cm³. Asparagus is mostly solid with air gaps in between the spears, packing factor ≈ 0.7 (since they are loose but touching). Hidden-layer multiplier not used (one visible layer only). Effective volume = 106.4 × 0.7 = 74.5 cm³. Density of cooked asparagus estimated at 0.6-0.8 g/ml, choose 0.7 g/ml as midpoint. Weight estimate = 74.5 g × 0.7 = 52 g. Low-high range: volume × density low/high = 74.5 × 0.6 = 45 g to 74.5 × 0.8 = 60 g approximately. Typical portion weight check: usual serving 100-150 g is higher, but given portion has 7 thinner spears. 90% plate capacity check: plate area is large; asparagus volume is small relative to total capacity. So weight fits within plausible smaller serving size. Therefore weight estimate of asparagus on plate is about 52 grams."
p96w4a,tartine mélasse + beurre,39.0,60,21.0,0.097187611249555,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/c9db26cc-13d6-4355-97a6-2355ea46cf42,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'tartine mélasse + beurre', which is a slice of bread with a spread of butter and molasses. Reference objects include the white dinner plate with an approximate diameter of 26 cm. Each tartine is roughly half the size of a standard dinner roll slice, measuring about 12 cm long, 5 cm wide, and the thickness of the bread plus spreads is estimated conservatively at 2 cm. The geometric volume is then approximately 12 cm × 5 cm × 2 cm = 120 cm³. The tartine is a dense solid (bread plus butter and molasses), so the packing factor is 1 (no gaps). Since it is a single slice, no hidden-layer multiplier is applied. The effective volume is therefore 120 cm³. Density for bread with butter and molasses is about 1.0 g/ml, considering the dense solid nature of bread and spreads. Thus, weight estimate = 120 g. Typical single slice of bread weighs about 30-50 g, butter spread about 5 g, and molasses about 10 g, giving a total plausible range of 45-65 g. However, here the tartine is thicker and chunkier bread, so the initial volume estimation is high; revising thickness down to about 1 cm total gives volume = 12 × 5 × 1 = 60 cm³; weight then about 60 g, which fits the typical portion size and fits the container size limit of the plate. So final estimate is 60 g for the tartine mélasse + beurre."

The target food item is 'oeuf' (egg). 1) Identify & locate: There is one hard-boiled egg cut into pieces on the plate. A typical hard-boiled egg weighs about 50-60 g. 2) Calibrate scale: The plate is a typical dinner plate, about 26-28 cm in diameter. The egg portion occupies about 1/6 to 1/7 of the plate area and has a visible depth of around 1.5-2 cm since it is cut in pieces and lying flat on the plate. 3) Volume, packing & density: Volume of the egg pieces is roughly rectangular area about 6 cm x 4 cm x 2 cm = 48 cm³ (48 ml). No hidden layer, packing factor near 1 as pieces are dense solid. Density of cooked egg is about 1.03 g/ml. 4) Discrete units: Only one egg portion present, so count = 1. 5) Low-high range: Volume × density = 48 ml × 1.03 g/ml = about 49.5 g. Typical single hard-boiled egg weight 50-60 g. 6) Sanity check: Estimated weight matches well with typical egg portion size and fits well within the plate capacity. Hence estimate is consistent. Final estimated weight close to 50 g."

Reference objects: the glass food container, typical adult hand width (not visible but table size suggests scale), the container is roughly 15 cm square. Geometric volume: Each galette is roughly oval 6 cm long x 4 cm wide x 1.5 cm thick, volume ≈ 36 cm³ per galette. Packing factor: these galettes are dense solids with some irregular structure, so packing factor = 1. Hidden layer multiplier: none, since galettes are stacked visibly in one layer, count physically visible units only. Density: millet, black beans and corn cooked, typically cooked legumes/vegetables density is about 0.7 g/cm³ to 0.8 g/cm³; I take 0.75 g/cm³ as a reasonable mean. Counting: there are 5 galettes visible. Volume per galette x packing x density = 36 cm³ x 1 x 0.75 g/cm³ = 27 g per galette. For 5 galettes, total weight estimated 135 g. Low-high range from volume and density uncertainty: ±20%, so approximately 108–162 g. Plausibility checks: typical millet-based galette portion weight is around 25–35 g per piece, this fits well with 27 g estimate. Also fits well below 90% container capacity (the container is about 15 cm x 15 cm x 4 cm max fill ~900 cm³; these galettes take about 36 cm³ x 5 =180 cm³, well below 90% of container volume. Therefore, the estimate is consistent and believable."

Reference objects used: dinner plate (approx. 26-28 cm diameter), fork (approx. 20 cm length). The pizza slice is placed on a dinner plate, estimating the width of the slice to be around 7 cm and length about 8 cm. Thickness is conservatively estimated at 1.5 cm due to the visible crust and toppings. Geometric volume calculation: 7 cm × 8 cm × 1.5 cm = 84 cm³. Pizza is a dense solid with some air pockets, so density is about 0.9 g/cm³ (slightly less than pure solid due to crust airiness). No hidden layers or packing factor needed because this is a single slice solid item. Effective volume is the same as geometric volume, 84 cm³. Estimated weight = volume × density = 84 × 0.9 = 75.6 g. Low-high range (±20% due to uncertainty in thickness): 60 - 90 g. Typical single pizza slice portion weighs between 70-120 g, and plate capacity is not directly limiting since it is a small portion. The midpoint (75.6 g) fits plausible portion size. Therefore, the estimated weight is about 76 grams."

Step 1: Identify & locate - The target food is 'chips vaya beans,' which are the flat crispy bean chips shown on the plate. These are unpackaged. Typical snack chip portions range between 20-40 g for a small serving. Step 2: Calibrate scale - The dish is a dessert plate approximately 20 cm in diameter. Step 3: Evaluate volume, packing, hidden depth & density - The pile of chips roughly covers a circular area of about 15 cm diameter. The thickness of an individual chip is about 0.2 cm, and the pile height is estimated around 3 cm (due to the overlap and layering), implying about 15 layers max. Chips are loose stacked, so packing factor would be around 0.5 due to air gaps. Hidden-layer multiplier is assumed 1.5 as chips are piled but not tightly compacted. Geometric volume = area x height = π * (7.5 cm)^2 * 3 cm ≈ 530 cm^3. Effective volume = 530 × 0.5 × 1.5 = 398 cm^3. Density of fried airy snacks like these chips is about 0.2 g/cm^3. Step 4: Mixed dish or discrete items - Discrete chips piled. Step 5: Low-high range & sanity checks - Weight estimate = 398 × 0.2 = 79.6 g. Considering uncertainties in height and packing, low-high range roughly 60-100 g. Typical snack portions fit well (~40 g) but this pile is visibly larger. The plate's capacity is large enough to hold up to about 100 g or more of such chips (90% limit ~ 120 g). The midpoint 80 g fits plausibly within these constraints. Step 6: Conclusion - The chips portion is estimated approximately 80 grams."

Reference objects used are the bowl and the table surface. The bowl diameter appears to be dessert-plate size, roughly 20 cm wide. The ice cream portion occupies about one quarter of the bowl's area, estimated length about 8 cm, width about 3.5 cm, and height about 3 cm (typical scoop height). Geometric volume = 8 cm × 3.5 cm × 3 cm = 84 cm³. Ice cream is relatively dense but aerated, so packing factor is 0.9 (close to solid because density is relatively high). No hidden layer multiplier, as the ice cream is a single solid scoop. Density for ice cream with hazelnut (glace noisette) is roughly 0.8–0.9 g/cm³, averaging 0.85 g/cm³. Effective volume = 84 × 0.9 = 75.6 cm³. Weight range = 75.6 × 0.8 = 60.48 g (low) to 75.6 × 0.9 = 68.04 g (high). Midpoint 64 g. Typical single scoop portion is around 60–80 g, so estimate is plausible. Container is a bowl that could hold ~500 ml, so 90% capacity ~450 g, so well below capacity. All checks consistent."

Reference objects: the plate is a dinner plate approx. 27 cm diameter. The mozzarella is the creamy white portion on top of the pasta. It appears roughly oval, about 7 cm long, 4 cm wide, and 2.5 cm high. Geometric volume = 7 cm x 4 cm x 2.5 cm = 70 cm3. Since mozzarella is soft but dense cheese with some moisture, let's use a density of 1 g/cm3 (approx. 1 g/ml) as typical. No hidden layers or packing factor needed since this is a single solid portion. Effective volume = 70 cm3. Density = 1 g/cm3. Weight estimate = 70 grams. Low-high range ±10 g for visual estimation uncertainty. Plausibility: typical fresh mozzarella portions are around 50-150 g, so 70 g fits well. 90% plate capacity is not limiting here because mozzarella is small relative to plate size. Therefore, the 70 g estimate is reliable for this mozzarella portion."

Geometric volume per slice = 9cm * 9cm * 1.2cm = 97.2 cm³. Packing factor = 1 (solid bread). Hidden-layer multiplier = 1 (only one layer, no pile). Density of toast (bread) is ~0.4 g/cm³ (light bread). Low-high range: using 0.35-0.45 g/cm³ density range gives 34-44 g per slice. Typical slice of toast weighs about 35-45 g. The plate can easily hold 90% capacity of ~400 g of food without problem, so container capacity check is passed. The midpoint is ~39 g which fits the typical portion range.

Reference object: dinner plate (~27 cm diameter). The salade verte portion covers roughly a semicircle measuring about 9 cm by 5 cm on the plate, so geometric volume = 9 cm × 5 cm × 1 cm (conservative fill height for leaves) = 45 cm³. Packing factor for raw leafy vegetables is about 0.3 to 0.5 due to air gaps; here I use 0.4. No hidden layer multiplier applied as leaves are flat and loosely arranged. Effective volume = 45 × 0.4 = 18 ml. Density of raw leafy vegetables typically 0.2 to 0.5 g/ml, I use 0.3 g/ml as reasonable for a lightly dressed salad. Estimated weight = 18 ml × 0.3 g/ml = 5.4 g. Low-high range using packing 0.3-0.5 and density 0.2-0.5 gives approximately 2.7 g to 11.25 g. Typical portion of salade verte is around 30-50 g, but visually this portion is quite small, likely a side garnish rather than a full portion. Volume also limited by plate capacity and arrangement. Adjusting for this visual small portion, a mid-value around 6 g is plausible and consistent with physical space on plate and visual appearance. Thus final estimate fits within sanity and portion checks."
wrah5h,tomates,28.0,13,15.0,0.04983980064079744,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/19a2e7b0-7aad-44c5-b52a-d67294d4ef49,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Reference objects include the dinner plate (approx 26 cm diameter) and the fork (approx 20 cm long) next to the plate. The geometric volume for the tomatoes can be estimated by considering the visible tomato pieces on the wrap: about 3 wedges, roughly 5 cm long, 2.5 cm wide, and about 1.5 cm thick (conservative depth). This gives a volume of 5 × 2.5 × 1.5 = 18.75 cm³. Since the wedges are compact but not fully solid volumes due to flesh and air gaps, a packing factor of around 0.7 is reasonable. There is no significant hidden layering as only 3 wedges are visible and it’s a flat lay. So hidden-layer multiplier is 1.0. Effective volume is 18.75 × 0.7 × 1.0 = 13.125 ml (cm³). The density of raw tomatoes is close to water, around 1 g/ml. So the estimated weight is 13.125 g. Typical portion weight aligns well with this (a small tomato wedge weighs about 10-15 g). The 90% container-capacity check is irrelevant here since tomatoes are a discrete ingredient, not a contained dish. The estimate is thus plausible."

Reference objects: square dinner plate approximately 26 cm wide. Geometric volume: raviolis laid out flat in a roughly 15 cm by 10 cm area, with an estimated height of 1 cm (typical ravioli thickness). Volume = 15 cm × 10 cm × 1 cm = 150 cm3. Packing factor: raviolis are discrete but closely packed, so about 0.85. No hidden layer multiplier because raviolis are single-layer. Effective volume = 150 × 0.85 = 127.5 cm3. Density: ravioli (pasta with squash filling) is a dense solid, approximately 1 g/cm3. Low-high range: considering volume and density, range about 120-135 g. Plausibility: typical portion of ravioli is about 120-150 g, and 127.5 g fits comfortably beneath the 90% container volume limit on this plate.

The target food is 'épinards frais' (fresh spinach), visible as green leaves distributed at the base of the bowl. Reference objects: the bowl is about 18 cm wide (a typical square bowl), the fork is not visible but we estimate based on bowl diameter. The spinach leaves cover roughly the entire bowl base but are not densely piled, with a relatively flat layer of about 1 cm thickness. Geometric volume estimate: bowl base ~ 18 cm × 18 cm = 324 cm² area, times 1 cm thickness = 324 cm³. Packing factor for raw leafy vegetables is around 0.3–0.5 (due to air gaps); here the leaves are lying flat but overlapping somewhat, so take 0.4 packing factor. Hidden-layer multiplier is not used as spinach leaves are visible flat and not piled in depth. Effective volume = 324 × 0.4 = 129.6 cm³. Density for raw leafy spinach: about 0.3 g/ml. Convert volume cm³ to ml (1:1), so mass = 129.6 × 0.3 = 38.9 g. Low-high estimate using packing factor from 0.3 to 0.5 and thickness ±0.5 cm (0.5 to 1.5 cm): considering thickness 0.5 cm = 324 × 0.5 = 162 cm³ × 0.3 packing = 48.6 cm³ effective → mass ~ 14.6 g; thickness 1.5 cm = 486 cm³ × 0.5 packing = 243 cm³ effective → mass ~ 72.9 g. Typical fresh spinach leaf portion in a salad is 30-50 g, which fits well within this range. The bowl capacity limit is large (likely about 90% of ~250 ml volume for spinach in bowl, ~225 g max), so well below this limit. The midpoint estimate ~38.9 g is within ±40% of typical portion and well under container capacity. Final estimate: 39 g."

Reference objects: dark dinner plate about 27 cm diameter. Geometric volume: each slice of bread about 8 cm long, 6 cm wide, and 2.5 cm thick gives volume 120 cm³ per slice; three slices total volume approx 360 cm³. Packing factor: solid bread so nearly full volume, packing factor ≈ 0.9 to account for air holes. Hidden-layer multiplier: not applicable as slices are discrete and flat. Effective volume = 360 cm³ × 0.9 = 324 cm³. Density: typical bread density ~0.27-0.35 g/cm³ because bread is porous; using 0.3 g/cm³ here. Weight estimate = 324 cm³ × 0.3 g/cm³ = 97 g. Low-high range: using ±20% for density and packing uncertainty yields 78-117 g. Plausibility check 1: typical single slice of bread weighs 25-35 g, three slices total 75-105 g, consistent with estimate midpoint. Plausibility check 2: 90% of plate volume would be much larger but bread only occupies part of the plate, so no conflict. Final estimate: 97 g is reasonable for three slices of bread shown."

Packing factor for raw leafy vegetables & salads is 0.3 for loose arrangement due to air gaps. No hidden layer multiplier used as the salad is a single layer visible. Effective volume = 35 × 0.3 = 10.5 cm³. Density of raw leafy salad: approximately 0.3 g/cm³. Estimated weight = 10.5 × 0.3 = 3.15 g. Low-high range considering ±30% variation: 2.2 g to 4.1 g. Typical small side salad portion is about 20-50 g; this portion looks smaller than typical side salad, so the estimate seems plausible. Considering 90% of plate area × max salad height capacity as an upper limit, this portion is much less than the limit, so it fits. Therefore, the estimate is reasonable and consistent with visual and typical portion size checks."

Reference objects: the dessert plate (approx. 20 cm diameter) and visible knife blade (approx. 20 cm long). The butter is spread thinly on a single slice of tresse bread (braided bread). The slice size is about 10 cm by 8 cm, with an estimated butter thickness of about 2 mm, typical for a butter spread. Geometric volume is approximately 10 cm × 8 cm × 0.2 cm = 16 cm³. Since the butter is spread smoothly, packing factor is 1.0 with no hidden layers. Density of butter is about 0.9 g/ml (0.9 g/cm³). Effective volume = 16 cm³, so estimated butter weight = 16 cm³ × 0.9 g/cm³ = 14.4 g. Low-high range considering thickness uncertainty (1.5 mm to 3 mm) yields 11 g to 22 g. Typical single serving of butter on bread ranges from 10 g to 20 g, so this fits well. The 90% capacity limit of the bread surface is about 16 g (assuming max 3 mm thickness), so the estimate is plausible within physical limits."

The food item to estimate is 'maréchal,' which in this context appears as several small cubed pieces of cheese on the plate. Reference objects include the eggs (approx. 50 g each) and the plate: a dinner plate about 27 cm diameter (red rim, white center). The geometric volume is estimated by visualizing the cheese cubes: three cubes, each about 2 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm = 8 cm^3 per cube, total 3 x 8 = 24 cm^3. Packing factor is essentially 1.0 because these are solid cheese pieces, no air gaps between cubes themselves. No hidden layers present since all cubes are visible. Density for cheese (dense solid) is approx. 1.1 g/cm^3. Effective volume = 24 cm^3 x 1 x 1 = 24 cm^3. Mass = 24 cm^3 x 1.1 g/cm^3 = 26.4 g. Low-high range based on volume and possible slight variations in cube sizes and density: +/- 20%, giving 21 g to 32 g. Typical portion weight for a cheese snack cube is about 20-30 g, plausible here. Plate capacity is ample, so no need to limit further. Therefore, estimated weight for 'maréchal' cheese cubes on plate is about 26 grams."

Geometric volume is length × width × height = 12 cm × 7 cm × 0.15 cm (average thickness) = 12.6 cm³. Assuming mélasse is a dense liquid similar to syrup, density is about 1.3 g/ml (higher than water). No hidden layers or packing factor needed since this is a spread on bread. Effective volume = 12.6 cm³. Weight estimate = 12.6 ml × 1.3 g/ml = approximately 16.4 g.

Geometric volume estimation: length about 10 cm, width about 8 cm, estimated butter thickness about 2 mm (0.2 cm), as it is a thin spread and not a thick layer. Volume = 10 cm × 8 cm × 0.2 cm = 16 cm³. Butter is a dense solid with density approximately 0.9 g/ml (0.9 g/cm³). No hidden layers or packing factor needed since this is a continuous thin spread. Effective volume = geometric volume = 16 cm³. Multiply by density: 16 × 0.9 = 14.4 g. Low-high weight range considering thickness uncertainty 1.5-2.5 mm is from 11 g to 18 g. Typical portion of butter on bread usually ranges from 10 to 20 g, so this estimate is plausible. The butter weight is well below 90% of plate area capacity and is in line with typical spread amounts. Therefore, the estimated butter weight on the slice is about 14 g."

The flakes cover roughly a half-oval area about 7 cm long and 4 cm wide. The oats form a relatively flat layer about 0.5 cm thick visible, so height is 0.5 cm (typical for dry oats in shallow spread). The geometric volume is approximately length × width × height = 7 cm × 4 cm × 0.5 cm = 14 cm³. Oats are loose flakes, so packing factor is roughly 0.6 due to air gaps. No hidden layers as flakes lie flat and sparse. Effective volume = 14 × 0.6 × 1 (hidden multiplier) = 8.4 cm³. Density of dry oat flakes is about 0.4-0.5 g/cm³, so using 0.45 g/cm³ midpoint. Weight estimate = 8.4 × 0.45 = 3.78 grams. Given typical single serving dry oat flakes are 30 to 50 grams, this is a small measured portion consistent with a small spread in the bowl. The volume-based estimate of about 3.8 grams fits plausibility checks since the bowl holds far more if fully filled and the portion is visibly small. Hence, the estimate is reasonable and consistent with the visual context."

The target food item is mayonnaise, located as a dollop on the left side of the plate. The plate appears to be a dinner plate, approximately 26-28 cm in diameter, giving us a reliable scale. The mayonnaise portion looks roughly cylindrical and about 4 cm wide and 1.5 cm high (typical for a dollop served by spoon). Geometric volume estimated as a flattened cylinder: π × (2 cm)² × 1.5 cm ≈ 18.8 cm³. Mayonnaise is dense and creamy, density roughly 0.9-1.1 g/ml; I take 1.0 g/ml as a midpoint. Because the dollop is a single mass, no hidden-layer multiplier or packing factor is required. Effective volume ≈ geometric volume = 18.8 ml. Multiplying volume by density gives approximately 19 g. Typical single-serve mayonnaise dollops for plating range between 15-25 g, so this weight is plausible. Also, the plate’s capacity at 90% is much higher (over 200 g potential in that area), so this weight fits comfortably as a condiment portion. Therefore, a low-high range estimate is about 15-25 g with midpoint near 19 g, consistent with typical serving sizes and plate scale."

Reference object: the dinner plate, approximately 27 cm diameter. The beurre (butter) portion is visible at the bottom of the plate; comparing its size relative to the plate, it appears to be a small pat roughly 5 cm long, 3 cm wide, and about 1 cm thick. Geometric volume: 5 cm × 3 cm × 1 cm = 15 cm³. Butter has a density of approximately 0.9 g/cm³ (or 0.9 g/ml) since it is a fatty solid. Packing factor is 1 since it is a solid chunk without air gaps; no hidden-layer multiplier is needed for a single piece. Effective volume = 15 cm³. Therefore, estimated weight = 15 × 0.9 = 13.5 g. Low-high range (±20% for estimation uncertainty): 11-16 g. Typical single portion (pat) of butter served in meals is around 10-15 g, fitting well within estimated range and plate portion size. The 90% container capacity check is not strictly applicable as this is a discrete butter portion on a plate. The mid estimate of 13.5 g matches typical portion size and visually fits with scale. Therefore, this is a reasonable estimate."

Reference object: dessert plate ≈ 20 cm diameter. The visible salami pieces cover roughly a 5 cm by 3 cm area, with an approximate thickness of 0.3 cm (typical slice thickness). Geometric volume = 5 cm × 3 cm × 0.3 cm = 4.5 cm³. The salami slices are overlapping and piled slightly; apply a hidden-layer multiplier of 1.5 to allow for some layering. Packing factor is high for dense sliced meat, about 0.9 to allow for small air gaps. Effective volume = 4.5 × 0.9 × 1.5 = 6.075 cm³. Density of dense solids (salami) is ≥ 1 g/cm³; typical salami density about 1.1 g/cm³. Weight range estimate = 6.075 × 1.0 (low) to 6.075 × 1.2 (high) = 6.1 to 7.3 grams. The typical single slice of salami is about 3-4 grams and 2-3 slices are visible, so ~6-8 g is plausible. The 90% container capacity check (plate area × max thickness 5 cm) is not restrictive here because the food occupies a small space on the plate. The estimate fits typical portion size and physical constraints well."
m4egh2,myrtilles,96.0,104,8.0,0.09113563545745818,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/9942fa79-be93-458e-b6a9-22fda9333ff4,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'myrtilles' (blueberries), which are visible both mixed and partly buried within the cereal and yogurt mixture in a bowl. The bowl is roughly dessert-plate size (approximately 20 cm diameter). I estimate the visible surface area of blueberries spread across the bowl at about 8 cm by 8 cm, with a maximum visible fill height of about 3 cm. Since the blueberries are partly hidden beneath others and mixed in, I apply a hidden-layer multiplier of 1.5 to account for an additional partial layer. Blueberries are loose items with moderate packing; I use a packing factor of 0.6 for their volume. Typical density for raw blueberries is approximately 0.6 g/ml (reasonable within the range of raw fruits). The geometric volume covered by blueberries is length × width × height = 8 cm × 8 cm × 3 cm = 192 cm³. Effective volume = 192 cm³ × 0.6 (packing) × 1.5 (hidden layer) = 172.8 cm³. Given 1 cm³ ≈ 1 ml, mass = volume × density = 172.8 ml × 0.6 g/ml ≈ 104 grams. Typical single portion of blueberries is about 100–120 grams, so this fits well. The 90% capacity of the dessert bowl (approximated as a cylinder 20 cm diameter by 5 cm depth) is about π × (10 cm)² × 5 cm × 0.9 = 1413 cm³ capacity, so the blueberry volume is well below container limit. The low-high range would vary about ±20%, so roughly 85 g to 125 g. The midpoint 104 g matches typical portion size and fits well within physical constraints."
p96w4a,demi croissant,14.0,22,8.0,0.01329061350421265,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/a7d36c03-057f-474b-9b76-5296d4f9faef,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Reference objects: white dessert plate approx. 20 cm diameter. The demi croissant is about half the size of a regular croissant. Typical weight for a full croissant is 60-70 g, hence half a croissant should be approx. 30-35 g. Geometric volume: The demi croissant piece on the plate approximates a roughly crescent-shaped solid about 6 cm long, 3 cm wide, and around 2 cm in height. This gives a rough volume of 6 x 3 x 2 = 36 cm3. Croissants are flaky and have air pockets, so a packing factor of around 0.45 is reasonable to account for air in the dough structure. No hidden layers are involved because it’s a single visible item. Effective volume = 36 cm3 x 0.45 = 16.2 cm3. Density: Since croissants are baked dough with air pockets, effective density is approx. 0.3–0.4 g/cm3. Using 0.35 g/cm3 as a midpoint. Weight estimate = 16.2 x 0.35 = 5.67 g. However, this is just the visible piece and appears to be roughly a quarter to a third of a whole croissant based on typical size proportions. Since it is labeled 'demi croissant' (half croissant), the visible piece is slightly less than half, but we take it as half for consistency. Thus, actual half croissant weight should be about 30-35 g, so the piece in the image looks like about half of a croissant minus some bites. Sanity check with typical portion weight: Half croissant is usually 30-35 g. Our estimate is lower because the piece is partially eaten; visually it's about 60-70% of half croissant size, so 20-25 g estimate fits well. Container limit (plate size) is not constraining here. Final estimated weight of demi croissant piece visible is approximately 22 g."

Reference objects: dessert plate (~20 cm diameter), spoon bowl (~4 cm wide), slice of bread with Nutella, and fruits (strawberries and raspberries). The raspberries (framboises) are located on the plate to the bottom-right of the bread. They are loose, discrete units. Count: 7 visible raspberries. Typical single raspberry weighs about 4-5 grams. Using 4.5 g as average. No hidden layers (pile height is low). Packing factor for loose raspberries is around 0.6-0.7, but since they are counted individually, no volume calculation is needed here. Density for raspberry is about 0.6-0.7 g/ml but since we count by units, we rely on average weight per unit. Volume approach validation: each raspberry roughly 2.5 cm long and about 1.5-2 cm wide, roughly ellipsoid, volume ~ (4/3)*π*(1.25 cm)*(1.0 cm)*(1.0 cm) = ~5 ml approx. Multiplied by density ~0.65 => ~3.25 g, hence 4.5 g per raspberry is a reasonable average considering variation and juiciness. Total weight: 7 raspberries × 4.5 g = 31.5 g. Low-high range ±20%: 25-38 g. Plausibility checks: Typical portion weights for raspberries often 30-50 g per serving, so mid-value fits typical portion size. Also, the plate space used (~5 cm × 3 cm) and the natural size fit easily on plate without crowding, volume constraints satisfactory. 90% capacity check on plate easily passed since raspberries occupy a small fraction of the plate. Therefore, the estimated weight of the framboises is around 31.5 grams."

Reference objects: the black plate (dessert plate size ≈ 20 cm diameter) and the slice of bread. The bread slice is approximately 12 cm wide and 10 cm tall, typical for a single slice of whole grain sandwich bread. Typical single slice bread weight in Switzerland is about 30-40 g. Geometric volume estimation is challenging for bread slices as they are flat; assuming thickness about 2 cm, effective volume is roughly 12 cm × 10 cm × 2 cm = 240 cm³. Bread is porous and light, so packing factor ≈ 0.5 (due to air). No hidden layer multiplier since it's a single slice. Effective volume = 240 × 0.5 = 120 cm³. Density of bread approximately 0.3-0.4 g/cm³. Calculated weight range = 120 × 0.3 = 36 g (low) to 120 × 0.4 = 48 g (high). Typical slice weight fits well within this range.

Geometric volume = 10 cm × 7 cm × 1.5 cm = 105 cm³. The waffle is a mostly solid cake-like item with some air holes but fairly dense, so packing factor = 1 (solid). No hidden layers. Density of a waffle is about 0.4-0.6 g/ml (typical baked waffle density is about 0.5 g/cm³). Effective volume = 105 cm³ × 1 = 105 cm³. Weight = volume × density = 105 × 0.5 = 52.5 g approximately. Low-high range using density 0.4–0.6 g/cm³ is 42 g to 63 g. Typical single homemade waffle weight ranges 50–70 g, which fits this estimate well. The plate capacity is large (dessert plate), so no container volume limit issue. Hence, estimate is plausible."

The target food item is 'sauce vinaigrette.' Step 1: Identify & locate. The vinaigrette is not visibly separate but likely lightly spread or mixed in the container, which is a rectangular metal lunch box about 20 cm long and 12 cm wide, a common lunchbox size. Step 2: Calibrate scale. Reference objects include the standard fork (20 cm) on the right and the metal lunch container roughly 20x12 cm. The container volume capacity estimated as area x height, at approximately 20 cm x 12 cm x 4 cm (conservative max fill height for liquids/sauces) = 960 cm3 volume capacity, 90% full limit ≈ 864 ml. Step 3: Evaluate volume, packing, depth & density. The vinaigrette is probably distributed mixed over or under the salad ingredients, typically about 1-2 tablespoons for a portion, so roughly 15-30 ml. Density approximated as watery liquid, 1 g/ml. Step 4: Mixed dish share. Since vinaigrette is diffuse, estimate the total amount as 15-30 grams in the dish. Step 5: Low-high range and sanity check. 15-30 g is standard for dressings for a single lunch portion and well below the container capacity limit. This is plausible. Step 6: Output is the midpoint, i.e., about 22 grams."

Reference objects: gold fork and knife set (approx. 20 cm each). The blue dinner plate diameter is estimated at 26 cm. The two halves of the œuf dur (hard-boiled egg) each have a length of about 4.5 cm and width of 3.5 cm when compared to the fork size. The egg halves show the cut surface and the visible volume corresponds roughly to half an egg. Typical weight of a single hard-boiled egg is about 50-60 g. The egg white and yolk together have a density close to dense solids ≥1 g/ml. The visible depth of the halves is estimated at about 1.5 cm (visible thickness of sliced egg). Geometric volume per half is roughly 4.5 cm × 3.5 cm × 1.5 cm = 23.6 cm³. For two halves, total geometric volume about 47.2 cm³. No hidden layers or packing factor needed since whole egg is visible as halves. Effective volume therefore 47.2 cm³. Using density ~1 g/ml, weight estimate = 47.2 g. This is slightly lower than typical whole egg weight (50-60 g), likely due to visible portions and some compression. Low-high range 45-60 g covers typical portion size. Check against typical portion (50-60 g) aligns well and the food is not contained in a limits-approaching container (plate capacity very large). Thus, final estimate 55 g is reasonable midpoint reflecting typical whole hard-boiled egg."

Geometric volume: approximating the chocolate piece as a rectangular prism, length 8 cm, width 2 cm, thickness about 1 cm (since it has nuts visible on the surface, it is thicker). Volume = 8 × 2 × 1 = 16 cm³. Packing factor: not applicable for a solid piece. Hidden-layer multiplier: not applicable because chocolate piece is discrete and solid. Effective volume = 16 cm³. Density: dense solid chocolate ~1.3 g/cm³ (typical density of milk chocolate with nuts). Low-high range: considering ±20% for size and density variability: volume range 13-19 cm³, density 1.2-1.4 g/cm³, weight range 15.6 g to 26.6 g. Midpoint ~21 g. Plausibility checks: Typical portion for such a chocolate bar is about 20-25 g, fits well with known Swiss chocolate bar unit weights (e.g., Kinder bar 21 g). Hand size comparison and packaging suggests the portion is around this standard. Container capacity limitation not applicable since this is a single chocolate piece.

Reference objects: The piece of bread (pain) appears to be about 8 cm long, based on typical bread slice sizes and visible crumb texture. The surface area covered by crème de marrons is roughly 8 cm × 3 cm = 24 cm². Thickness of the crème de marrons layer is thin, approximately 0.3 cm, as it's spread on bread. Geometric volume = 24 cm² × 0.3 cm = 7.2 cm³. Crème de marrons is a purée-like dense sweet spread, so packing factor = 1 (spread smoothly, no gaps). No hidden layers or piled depth, so hidden-layer multiplier = 1. Effective volume = 7.2 cm³ × 1 × 1 = 7.2 cm³. Density of crème de marrons spread is similar to thick sweet purées, approx. 1.2 g/ml (since it's dense, slightly over 1 g/ml). Weight estimate = 7.2 ml × 1.2 g/ml = 8.64 g, rounded to about 9 grams. Typical single-portion size of crème de marrons spread on bread slice is around 10 g, so estimate fits usual portion size.

Geometric volume: approximate length 4 cm, width 3 cm, and an estimated height of 1.5 cm, giving a volume of 4 × 3 × 1.5 = 18 cm³. As a solid cheese piece, no hidden layer multiplier is needed. Packing factor is 1 for a solid piece. Density for semi-soft cheese like tomme fleurette is about 1.0 g/cm³. Effective volume therefore 18 cm³, effective weight about 18 g. Sanity checks: Typical portion of tomme fleurette cheese wedges is around 15-25 g, fitting well within container capacity limits (since the plate holds multiple items and the wedge occupies only a small part).

Reference objects: white bowl, lighter, and countertop are visible. A typical small dessert bowl can hold about 300 ml volume; this bowl appears to be about dessert bowl size, around 15 cm diameter and 7 cm height. The food is graines de chia mixed within a creamy, thick mixture in the bowl. Looking at the visible chia seeds scattered evenly across the surface, the chia seeds are embedded in the white mixture, partially exposed on the top layer. We estimate the chia seed layer is dispersed within roughly 7 cm diameter and a fill height of 3 cm max in bowl. Geometric volume for seeds alone is not a solid block but scattered; the actual gap between seeds is large. Single portion typical chia seed usage is around 15-20 g per serving. The portion here appears reasonably moderate but not large. For estimating volume of chia seeds: the mixture contains oats and honey too, so chia seeds are about 10-20% of the mixture's volume by visual density. Effective volume of chia seeds is estimated as 10% of a 250 ml bowl fill = 25 ml. Packing factor for chia seeds as dry small seeds is about 0.6 due to gaps. No hidden layer multiplier as seeds are mixed in surface and depth. Density of dry chia seeds is about 0.7 g/ml. Effective volume = 25 ml × 0.6 = 15 ml. Mass = effective volume × density = 15 ml × 0.7 g/ml = 10.5 g. Low-high range using 0.5-0.8 g/ml density: 7.5 g to 12 g. Plausibility checks: Typical portion size 15-20 g (close enough). Bowl 90% max capacity for entire mixture ~270 g; chia seeds estimate is well below this. Therefore estimate is reliable and consistent."

The target food is parmesan, which appears lightly sprinkled within the risotto on a dessert plate (approx. 20 cm diameter). The visible parmesan is grated and scattered, likely not exceeding 1 cm thickness over the risotto surface. The risotto serving is roughly 12 cm by 9 cm in spread on the plate, with about 2 cm height. Volume for parmesan layer is therefore around (12 cm × 9 cm × 0.1 cm) = 10.8 cm³. Parmesan is a dense solid with typical density around 1.1 g/cm³ (grated cheese compactness). Considering the scattered thin layer, the packing factor is high at 0.9 (almost full compactness for grated cheese). No hidden layers apply here as it’s a thin sprinkle. Effective volume is 10.8 × 0.9 = 9.72 cm³. Weight estimate is volume × density = 9.72 × 1.1 = approximately 10.7 grams. This aligns with typical parmesan sprinkle amounts on a single portion of risotto, usually 5–15 grams. The 90% container capacity limit is irrelevant since parmesan is a topping only. Thus, an estimated weight of 11 g is plausible and consistent."

The hummous is located at the bottom left of the plate, a loose dollop about 6 cm wide and approximately 2 cm high, shaped roughly elliptical. Geometric volume = length × width × height ≈ 6 cm × 4 cm × 2 cm = 48 cm³. Packing factor for hummous, a dense purée-like food, is about 0.95 (nearly solid due to smooth texture). No hidden layer multiplier is needed as hummous is a paste, not piled items. Effective volume = 48 cm³ × 0.95 = 45.6 mL. Density of hummous is approximately 1.0 g/mL. Thus, volume × density = 45.6 g. Comparing with typical Swiss hummous tub sizes (45-70 g for small tubs) and observing that the portion here is a modest dollop, the estimate fits well. The 90% capacity limit of the plate is not a limiting factor here. Low-high range considering height uncertainty (1.5-2.5 cm) gives approx 34 - 57 g, midpoint 45 g, which matches typical portion size from Step 1 and is plausible on the plate. Thus the best estimate is about 45 g."

Reference objects: square bowl approximately 17x17 cm, fork or hand is not visible but typical bowl size used as reference. Geometric volume: the pousse de graines (sprouts) cover about 9x7 cm area within the bowl with a conservative fill height of about 2 cm, giving a geometric volume of 9 cm x 7 cm x 2 cm = 126 cm³. Packing factor: sprouts are loosely packed so about 0.5 is reasonable. Hidden-layer multiplier: as sprouts are slightly piled with some overlapping but visible gaps, a moderate hidden-layer multiplier of 1.4 is applied. Effective volume = 126 cm³ x 0.5 x 1.4 = 88.2 cm³. Density: raw sprouts have low density around 0.3 g/ml. Low-high volume range with uncertainty on fill height from 1.5 to 2.5 cm gives geometric volume range of 9x7x1.5=94.5 to 9x7x2.5=157.5, applying packing and multiplier accordingly yields effective volume range approximately 66 to 110 cm³. Weight range = volume x density = 66 x 0.3 = ~20 g to 110 x 0.3 = ~33 g. Plausibility check: typical portion of sprouts used as salad topping or side is about 20-40 g, matching the estimate. The portion fits easily within the bowl, well below 90% capacity. Therefore, estimated weight is consistent and plausible."

The target food is huile de lin (linseed oil). 1. Identify & locate: The linseed oil is not visibly present as a liquid pool or bottle in the image, likely just a small amount mixed into the food or invisible as a thin coating. Typical portion size of cooking or finishing oil in such a meal ranges from 5 to 15 grams. 2. Calibrate scale: The reference object is a dessert plate approximately 20 cm in diameter. The plate is full of food, no visible separate oil container. 3. Evaluate volume, packing, hidden depth & density: Oil density is about 0.92 g/ml. Minimal visible volume since oil is invisible or absorbed in the food. Assume a plausible usage of about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) or less of oil for this plate. Volume max approx 15 ml. No packing or hidden-layer multiplier needed. 4. Mixed dish or discrete items: The oil is mixed in or on other foods, not discrete. So only estimate the plausible volume used. 5. Low-high range & sanity check: Typical cooking or dressing oil portion ranges 5-15 grams. The upper limit is well below 90% of the plate capacity. Midpoint about 10 g fits typical usage well. 6. Compose output: Based on typical usage and the invisibility of oil as a separate item, estimate about 10 grams of huile de lin for the meal shown."

Target food is 'muesli nature'. Reference object for scale: the white dish beside the orange bowl holding the muesli can be assumed approximately 14 cm wide (typical small serving dish). The brown bowl holding the muesli is about 10 cm diameter, estimated by comparison to dish handles (around 4 cm wide). Geometric volume: the visible muesli fills the bowl roughly to a height of about 4 cm. So volume = π × (radius 5 cm)^2 × 4 cm ≈ 314 cm³. Packing factor for muesli (loose clusters with air gaps) is 0.5. No hidden layer multiplier since the muesli pieces are chunky and visible to the bottom with some air gaps but no obvious layering. Effective volume = 314 × 0.5 = 157 ml. Density for dry cereal clusters like this is about 0.4 g/ml, as raw cereals and granola are mostly air and oats. Therefore, estimated weight = 157 × 0.4 = 63 g. Low-high range considering volume uncertainty ±20% gives about 50 to 75 g. Typical portion size for muesli clusters is around 40-60 g, so this fits plausibly. The bowl's 90% full capacity is about 314 × 0.9 = 282 ml, which is well above the estimate so no container size limit violations. Therefore, the estimate is reasonable and fits typical portion size. Final weight estimate: 63 g."

The target food is ""pain,"" a piece of bread with eggplant spread on it. Reference object: the dinner plate, approximately 26-28 cm in diameter. The piece of bread is about 10 cm long and 5 cm wide, estimated by comparison with the plate's pattern and visible plate size in the image. The thickness of the bread slice is roughly 2-3 cm, but I'll use 2.5 cm for a conservative estimate. Geometric volume is approximately 10 cm × 5 cm × 2.5 cm = 125 cm³. Bread is porous and airy, so a lower density is likely. Packing factor is 1 since it is a solid slice (not loose items). There is no hidden layer multiplier as it is a single piece. Density for bread typically ranges between 0.3 and 0.5 g/cm³ (raw leafy veg/salads are 0.2-0.5, bread is a dense baked solid but still less dense than meat or cheese). Using 0.4 g/cm³ as mean density for this bread slice. Effective volume = 125 cm³ × 1 × 1 = 125 cm³. Weight estimate is volume × density = 125 × 0.4 = 50 g. Bread typical portion size is around 30-60 g per slice, so 50 g fits well within expected range. Plate capacity (a whole plate slice is small compared to plate size) is not limiting here. Range low-high from 0.3 to 0.5 density gives approx 37.5 g to 62.5 g. Midpoint 50 g lies comfortably in typical portion weights and no container capacity issues identified."

The target food is pain (bread), and there are two slices visible on a standard dinner plate (≈ 26-28 cm diameter). Each slice of bread is roughly 10 cm by 6 cm by an estimated 1.5 cm thickness. The geometric volume of one slice is therefore approximately 10 × 6 × 1.5 = 90 cm³. Bread is porous and light; typical density ranges from 0.25 to 0.3 g/cm³. There is no hidden layer multiplier needed as the slices are flat and distinct. Packing factor is 1 since it’s a solid piece. Effective volume remains 90 cm³. Density chosen conservatively at 0.28 g/cm³. Thus, estimated weight = 90 × 0.28 = 25.2 g. Low-high range using density 0.25 to 0.3 g/cm³ is 22.5 g to 27 g. A typical slice of bread weighs roughly 25-30 g, fitting plausibility range and easily fitting under 90% capacity of the dried food volume on the plate. Hence the estimate is consistent and plausible."

The target food is beurre (butter), located as a small rectangular piece on the right side of the plate. The butter piece is unpackaged. Typical single portion sizes for butter pats are commonly around 5-10 grams. For scale, the plate is a dessert plate approximately 20 cm diameter; the butter piece is about 3 cm long and 1 cm wide, and assuming a height of about 1 cm (typical for spreadable butter pats), the geometric volume is approximately 3 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm = 3 cm³. Butter has a density of about 0.9 g/cm³ (slightly less than water). There is no hidden layer, and no packing factor as it is a solid piece. Effective volume equals geometric volume = 3 cm³. Weight estimate = 3 cm³ × 0.9 g/cm³ = 2.7 g. This is somewhat low compared to typical portion pats (5-10 g), but the piece is visibly smaller than a common butter pat. The 90% plate capacity limit is large, but the physical size and density restrict real weight to a low single-digit figure. To balance with typical portion sizes for clarity and visual impression, I set a low-high range of about 2.5-5 g, with midpoint 3.7 g, leaning to the lower side since the piece is quite small. This fits plausibility checks well."

Target food is 'biscuit', located on top of the glass near the ice cream scoop. It is unpackaged, and typical single portion weights for a thin crisp biscuit are about 10-15 grams. Reference objects are the glass and dessert plate: dessert plate is approx 20 cm diameter, glass is about 18 cm tall. The biscuit piece is roughly 6-7 cm long and around 3-4 cm wide, with a thickness about 0.3 cm (thin cracker-like). So geometric volume approx 6.5 cm × 3.5 cm × 0.3 cm = 6.8 cm³. Packing factor for solid dense biscuit is 1 (no air gaps inside the solid), and no hidden layer multiplier as it is a single visible piece. Density of biscuit is about 0.9-1.1 g/cm³, similar to dense solids but slightly less due to air in biscuit. Effective volume = 6.8 cm³ × 1 = 6.8 cm³. Weight range = volume × density = 6.8 × 0.9 = 6.1 g (low) to 6.8 × 1.1 = 7.5 g (high). This compares well with typical biscuit portion (10-15 g per full biscuit, but this is a partial piece), and no container capacity limit issues. Hence final weight estimate is about 7 grams."

Identify & locate: The target food is a 'barre de chocolat kinder'. It is unpackaged in the image and looks like a single standard Kinder chocolate bar segment. A typical single standard Kinder bar weighs 21 g as recalled from common Swiss sizes. 2. Calibrate scale: The chocolate bar is placed on a wooden surface with no direct reference object visible for precise scale, but based on the known size of a Kinder bar segment (typical length about 8-9 cm), the size matches typical dimensions. 3. Evaluate volume, packing, hidden depth & density: The chocolate bar is a solid with typical dense solid density (≥ 1 g/ml). Volume estimation is not necessary as the standard known weight is reliable and packaging is absent. 4. Mixed dish or discrete items: This is a single discrete item. 5. Low-high range & mandatory sanity checks: Using 21 g as the typical portion weight fits perfectly with the visual and known size, and no container constraints apply. The weight estimate is therefore consistent with all checks. 6. Compose output: Weight estimate is 21 grams for the target food item."

Reference object is the wooden plank grooves and grain pattern, which help confirm the scale; typical width of plank grooves is about 1 cm, consistent with the length of the chocolate bar being approximately 8-9 cm long. The chocolate bar is a single unit of Kinder chocolate bar, which is known to have a typical weight of 21 g. The geometric size estimated by visual comparison and general knowledge is around 8.5 cm length, 2.5 cm width, and 1.5 cm height, resulting in a volume approximately 8.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 = 31.9 cm³. Chocolate is a dense solid, so density is ≥1 g/cm³; we take approximately 1.1 g/cm³ for milk and white chocolate combined density. No hidden layers or packing factors are needed as this is a solid single piece. Hence effective volume is the geometric volume of 31.9 cm³. Multiplying by density 1.1 g/cm³ gives approximately 35 grams, which is higher than the known commercial Kinder bar weight of 21 g. This is likely an overestimation of volume due to rough size approximation. Given the known weight of a Kinder bar is 21 g (specified as a common Swiss single unit size), and the visual scale matches a regular Kinder bar, the best weight estimate is to take the commercial standard of 21 g. This also fits plausibility check with container or plate scale and known portion sizes perfectly. Therefore, the plausible final estimate is 21 grams."

Reference objects used are the wooden table surface where the Kinder chocolate bar is placed; the bar appears to be a single unit. The typical weight for a single Kinder chocolate bar is about 21 grams as per common Swiss single-unit sizes. The chocolate bar is discrete and unpackaged but fully visible in the image, so no need to estimate volume or packing factor in detail. Dimensions roughly correspond to the known standard size of a Kinder chocolate bar, length around 8-10 cm, width around 2-3 cm, thickness approximately 1 cm. These dimensions align with the known weight of 21 grams, which is typical and plausible for a single bar. The bar is not in a package with other items, so the estimate is straightforward without hidden layers or packing multipliers. The estimate conforms with typical portion weights and the physical size visible, so no recalibration is needed."

The target food is beurre (butter) spread on two slices of bread. The reference object is a standard dessert plate approximately 20 cm in diameter. The butter is spread thinly and unevenly over the surface of the bread. The combined butter coverage appears to take up roughly half the area of the two slices of bread, each about 12 cm by 6 cm (72 cm² total), so butter covers around 36 cm² in total. The spread thickness of butter on bread is typically very thin, around 1-2 mm (0.1-0.2 cm). Calculating volume: 36 cm² × 0.15 cm (average thickness) = 5.4 cm³. Butter has a density around 0.9 g/cm³. Butter is a dense solid with a packing factor of 1 (spread flat). No hidden layers or stacking. Effective volume is therefore 5.4 cm³. Weight estimate is volume × density = 5.4 × 0.9 = 4.9 g. Typical single portion for butter spread on bread is about 5-10 g. The 90% plate capacity rule does not apply here as butter is on bread. The estimated weight of about 5 g fits well with typical portion and visible spread thickness, so the estimate is plausible."
