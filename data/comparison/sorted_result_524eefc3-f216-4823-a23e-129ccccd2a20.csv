2ahgvr,salade grecque,315.0,600.0,285.0,14.144477706002837,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/c476a6d0-acb2-45fd-b168-84822bc98003,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food item is 'salade grecque' which is present in a white plastic container. The salad consists of diced cucumber, tomato, yellow bell pepper, onion rings, olives, and small chunks of feta cheese. The salad pieces are small and uniformly diced. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The container size appears to be approximately a medium food storage container, roughly 15 cm x 10 cm footprint visible. The salad fills about half to two-thirds of the container depth, estimated around 6 to 7 cm tall. This gives a rough volume of roughly 15cm x 10cm x 6.5cm = 975 cm³. Since the salad is not compacted fully to the top and contains air gaps, effective volume of salad content is approximately 70-75% of container volume, around 700 cm³. Step 3: Density Considerations - Greek salad components are mainly vegetables (high water content, moderate density) plus feta cheese which is denser. Average density for mixed salad with cheese and dressing can be estimated around 0.85 to 0.9 g/cm³ due to oil and cheese. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The portion is a medium-sized salad portion in a Swiss context, somewhat small to medium for a single meal. Step 5: Cross-validation - Considering the volume and density, estimated weight = 700 cm³ x 0.9 g/cm³ = 630 grams. Given that some air gap may reduce effective weight, and visual portion size hints at slightly less than a full medium size portion, conservatively adjust down to about 600 grams. Thus, the best estimate is approximately 600 grams for the Greek salad in the container. Sauce is not included in this estimation as per rules."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,140.0,277.0,18.198991649598234,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is salade de tomates (tomato salad). In the image, the tomato slices are clearly visible on a medium-sized plate. The salad contains approximately 12-15 slices of medium-sized tomato wedges and slices. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The plate is standard sized (around 22-24 cm diameter). The tomato slices are roughly 5-6 cm in length and about 1-1.5 cm thick. The salad is a single-layer pile with minimal stacking, so no large hidden volume. Step 3: Density Considerations - Tomatoes are fruits with relatively high water content, density close to 0.9 g/cm3. The salad includes visible dressing and flax seeds on top but these are not counted as part of the tomato weight. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - A typical medium tomato weighs approximately 120-150g. Given the quantity visible, the salad likely includes about 1 to 1.3 medium tomatoes worth of slices, so roughly 130-160 g. Step 5: Cross-validation - The tomato slices cover most of the plate area but not piled deeply; thus, the lower end of this range is more likely. Conservatively, estimate around 140 g for just the tomatoes. This fits the Swiss portion context, which tends to be smaller than US portions. Therefore, the tomato salad weight is estimated at approximately 140 grams."
xjvrtk,tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe,250.0,110.0,140.0,5.514416259650228,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/f607625b-a07d-423e-a564-4d96ebadf084,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, the target food item is 'tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe,' which is a flat, thin tart with diced apple and rhubarb topping. Visually, the tart piece occupies most of a small dinner plate, approximately 20 cm diameter. The slice is roughly triangular with a base and height near 15 cm. The tart crust appears thin and crisp, about 2-3 mm thick, typical for a tarte flambée. The topping consists mostly of diced rhubarb and possibly apple pieces distributed evenly and with a light creamy or custard layer beneath. The topping depth is shallow, about 1-1.5 cm typical for such a tart. The ingredients, apple and rhubarb, are moderately dense fruits; their cooked form often contains moisture, not very dense but not light either. Comparing the slice size to the plate, this represents about one quarter of a 30-35 cm tarte flambée, estimating overall dimensions conservatively for Swiss portion size norms. A whole tarte flambée typically weighs around 400-500 grams for such fruit toppings, so a single quarter slice would weigh roughly 100-125 grams. Accounting for the thin crust and moderate topping volume, a safe estimate leans towards the middle range, about 110 grams. This accounts for visible volume, ingredient density, and Swiss portion context. Therefore, the estimated weight of this single slice of tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe is about 110 grams."
8japfq,ratatouille,196.0,80.0,116.0,3.5821648022687884,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/b6659a8f-25e7-44f7-a351-7873f60f1586,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food item is ratatouille. It is located on the plate's upper right section, consisting of mixed vegetables in a stewed form, with visible chunks of zucchini, eggplant, tomato, and possibly peppers. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The ratatouille portion appears to be roughly the size of half a small fist, approximately 7 cm by 5 cm across the surface. Given it is spread in a shallow pile about 2-3 cm deep, it has noticeable volume. Compared to the bulgur serving next to it, it is about two-thirds its volume. Step 3: Density Considerations - Ratatouille is cooked vegetables stewed in tomato sauce, moderately dense but with some water content. Typical cooked vegetable density is around 0.8-1 g/cm³. The visible chunkiness suggests it's not overly liquid but fairly dense for vegetables. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given Swiss portion sizes are smaller, this looks like a medium-sized serving of ratatouille, neither a small side nor a very large scoop. Estimated volume about 70-90 cubic centimeters, thus weight roughly 70-90 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - Considering the relative portion on the plate and typical serving sizes for ratatouille in Swiss meals, around 80 grams is a reasonable estimate, neither under- nor overestimated."
wrah5h,polenta,209.0,100.0,109.0,3.5892547660311958,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/f727ac79-973e-4b92-8f2b-cda94222d4a7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is polenta, located on the right side of the container underneath a layer of grated cheese. Visually, the polenta forms a solid mound roughly the size of a small fist, approximately 7 cm in length, 5 cm in width, and around 3 cm in depth, considering some hidden thickness beneath the cheese. The polenta appears dense but soft, typical of cooked polenta. Comparing to the size of the container and the other food items, the portion is moderate. Given the density of cooked polenta (approx. 1 g/cm3) and the volume estimate (7x5x3=105 cm3), the raw volume would approximate about 100-110 grams. Given this is a Swiss portion, slightly smaller than US portions, I estimate the polenta weighs around 100 grams, adjusting slightly down from the raw volume calculation due to the presence of the cheese on top adding visual bulk but not weight to the polenta itself. Thus, a reasonable and conservative estimate is 100 grams for the polenta portion."
wrah5h,"délice des dieux (biscuit, fruits rouges, séré+mascarpone)",205.0,110.0,95.0,3.068378761619663,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/5de398c7-684b-448d-ba0a-f318d009bccd,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: The target food item is 'délice des dieux,' a dessert composed of biscuit, red fruits, séré, and mascarpone. The image shows a single piece of this dessert on a standard-sized small dessert plate. Step 2: Visually, the piece is roughly rectangular, about 8 cm in length and 6 cm in width, with a thickness estimated around 2.5 cm considering the biscuit base, fruit layer, and mascarpone topping. Step 3: The dessert layers consist of a soft biscuit, a layer of fruit compote (dense, moist), and a creamy mascarpone/séré topping (less dense but thick). Between the biscuit and fruit compote, moisture would compact the biscuit slightly, so overall density is moderate. Step 4: For portion size calibration, a Swiss portion of such a dessert slice typically weighs around 100-150 grams depending on thickness. The depth here is moderate, and the slice is somewhat irregular in shape with a bite taken off one corner that reduces weight slightly. Step 5: Adjusting for the bite taken off the piece and estimating hidden volume under the mascarpone layer, I assess this piece weighs closer to 110 grams, which fits a medium portion in Swiss context. Cross-validation: Plate size reference confirms this is not a large portion; the dessert layers' density and volume justify a weight over 100 grams but less than 130 grams."
p8a2w5,tarte aux fraises,164.0,85.0,79.0,2.041279344572239,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/7b64b358-b611-4155-8e79-6f3ce5b4f11a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is a slice of strawberry tart (tarte aux fraises). It is a single slice with visible strawberries on the top, a creamy filling underneath, and a visible thin pastry base. There are around 7-8 medium-sized strawberry halves on the tart slice. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The plate is a standard dessert plate (~20 cm diameter). The tart slice occupies roughly 1/6 to 1/8 of a full tart size, estimated at 10 cm wide at the base and about 2.5 cm thick including filling and pastry. The strawberries on top are medium size, about 3-4 cm each in length, arranged in one layer. The cream layer is dense and thick, about 1.5 cm depth. The pastry base is thin, approximately 0.5 cm thick. Step 3: Density Considerations - Strawberries are light but relatively dense (0.6-0.7 g/cm3). Creamy filling is dense (around 0.9 g/cm3); pastry is flaky but dense (approx 0.8-0.9 g/cm3). Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - This is a medium slice typical in Swiss dessert portions, not oversized. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Avoid underestimating volume from the cream layer and over-counting strawberries. The estimated volume around 10 cm (length) x 5 cm (width) x 2.5 cm (height) = 125 cm3 total. Strawberry volume approx: 7 halves x roughly 10 cm3 each = 70 cm3. Cream and pastry combined ~55 cm3. Strawberry weight: 70 x 0.65 = 45.5 g. Cream and pastry weight: 55 x 0.9 = 49.5 g. Total estimated weight ~95 g, rounding conservatively for slight overestimation of strawberry size and some air gaps, final estimation about 85 g."
p96w4a,délice tomate mozzarella,54.0,130.0,76.0,0.6466046951315583,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/5ebafbd6-315d-44a6-8508-ba143d23adb2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'délice tomate mozzarella'. In the image, this dish consists of alternating slices of tomato and mozzarella arranged neatly on the left side of the plate with some balsamic vinegar and herbs sprinkled on top. Step 1: Visual identification - There are 7 visible slices of tomato and 7 slices of mozzarella, alternating. Both components are sliced evenly. Step 2: Dimension analysis - Each tomato slice is about 1 cm thick, and each mozzarella slice similarly about 1 cm thick, with a diameter roughly equal to a medium tomato around 7-8 cm. The total stacked height would be about 14 cm if all stacked, but here the slices overlap flatly. Assuming thickness for layering, the volume is roughly the combined base area multiplied by an average thickness of each slice. Step 3: Density - Tomato is mostly water with density close to 0.95 g/cm3. Mozzarella cheese is denser, approximately 1.03 g/cm3. Tomatoes slice weight: a medium tomato weighs about 120-150g. Given slices roughly half the tomato are shown, that's approximately 60-75g tomato. Mozzarella slices visually look standard portion sizes; a mozzarella ball offers about 125-150g, and here about half or slightly less is present, estimating around 60-70g mozzarella. Step 4: Portion size calibration - This plate has a small to medium portion consistent with Swiss portions, so choosing the middle to lower-middle range of these estimates is reasonable. Step 5: Cross-validation - The balance between tomato and mozzarella slices looks consistent with the above estimates, no visible leftover or hidden portions. Therefore, the estimated total weight for the 'délice tomate mozzarella' as a whole is the sum of the tomato and mozzarella slices, roughly 65g tomato + 65g mozzarella = 130g total approx. Since the question is asking for the weight of 'délice tomate mozzarella' (the prepared dish including both), this total is the best estimate based on visual evidence."
ppf8hc,pâtes carbonara,236.0,160.0,76.0,2.8259020009453284,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/4d4e6539-b86f-4019-b2aa-0c15dbce0667,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: The target food is ""pâtes carbonara."" The image shows a plate with a serving of pasta carbonara including cooked pasta (penne and maybe some other shapes), cream sauce with small pieces of bacon or ham, and a visible sprinkle of grated cheese (Gruyère) on top. Step 2: Dimension analysis: The plate is a standard size dinner plate (about 26-28 cm diameter). The pasta portion covers a central area roughly 10-12 cm wide. The pasta is layered with pieces overlapping, and partially covered with sauce and cheese. The pasta serves as a dense food, cooked and compacted. Step 3: Density considerations: Cooked pasta with sauce and meat bits is dense and compact. Gruyère cheese on top adds weight but must be excluded if estimating only ""pâtes carbonara"" including sauce and meat but not the grated cheese separately. Step 4: Portion size calibration: Given Swiss contexts, this serving looks like a moderate individual portion, roughly 150-180 g of cooked pasta and sauce mixture, plus about 15-20 g of grated Gruyère cheese on top. Since only ""pâtes carbonara"" is requested (and the cheese is listed separately), the estimate should be for pasta + sauce + bacon only, excluding the grated cheese. Therefore, estimated weight is approximately 160 g for the pasta carbonara. Step 5: Cross-validation: The portion is neither very small nor very large—fits a typical Swiss meal portion that is moderate. The visible volume and density confirm this estimate. Thus, the best estimate for ""pâtes carbonara"" (excluding Gruyère) is 160 grams."

The target food to estimate is ""purée de pdt"" (mashed potatoes). Step 1: Visual identification shows a roughly rectangular portion of mashed potatoes under the meat and carrots, mostly visible though partially covered by stew meat and sauce. It appears to cover about a quarter of the plate's surface, with moderate thickness. Step 2: Dimension analysis using the plate as reference (typical plate diameter approx. 25 cm), the mashed potatoes portion is roughly 10 cm long and 7 cm wide, thickness about 2 cm, giving a volume estimation of about 140 cm³. Step 3: Considering density, mashed potatoes have a density close to 1 g/cm³ due to air incorporated but mostly dense, so approximate 1g per cm³ is reasonable. Step 4: Portion size calibration: volume suggests a medium portion, so the weight is around 140 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation avoids common errors by including only the visible mashed potatoes and not including sauce or other items. Therefore, the estimated weight for the mashed potatoes is about 140 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The tiramisu is the left piece on the plate. It appears as one chunk with a visible layer of cream and soaked sponge. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The piece is roughly the size of a typical medium dessert portion, approximately 8 cm long, 4 cm wide, and about 3.5-4 cm thick, considering the depth of the cream and cake layers. The plate size and the forêt noir piece next to it serve as references for scale. Step 3: Density Considerations - Tiramisu is a layered dessert with soaked sponge (moderate density) and creamy mascarpone layers (less dense but thicker). Overall density is slightly less than a dense cake but more than a simple mousse due to the soaked sponge. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given the size and composition, this is a medium portion. Typical Swiss tiramisu portions for this size range between 120-160 grams. Considering thickness and cream content, estimate closer to 140 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The visible portion is intact, and no significant hidden volume unaccounted for. The moist texture adds weight over dry cake. Thus 140 grams is a reasonable estimation."
ppf8hc,boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate,316.0,250.0,66.0,3.285961871750433,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/bf22a1b3-a8b6-4823-a44b-0893c3097763,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. STEP 1: Visually, the 'boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate' are the 10 small vegetable meatballs visible on and around the pasta. They are roughly spherical, evenly distributed, some partially covered by sauce. STEP 2: Using the plate and pasta as reference, each boulettes appears to be about 3-4 cm in diameter. Considering this size, typical vegetable meatballs of this size in Swiss portions generally weigh about 25-30 grams each. STEP 3: Vegetable meatballs have a medium density, slightly lighter than meat ones due to vegetables but still compact. Each boulettes probably close to 25g. STEP 4: Counting 10 boulettes × 25g = 250g total. Given the portion, 250g seems medium to large for a vegetable meatball serving in Switzerland, but the visual evidence supports this. STEP 5: Cross validation confirms this quantity is reasonable for the visible size, counting, and density. No container weight included, depth fully accounted for. Therefore, estimated weight for the vegetable meatballs is 250 grams."
wrah5h,gaufre à la patate douce,85.0,150.0,65.0,0.8704899952733575,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1876b0b6-568d-4583-8186-073df252e6c9,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Identify the target food item, 'gaufre à la patate douce'. There are four pieces of sweet potato waffles arranged on the plate. Step 2: Analyze dimensions. Each waffle piece appears to be roughly 7 cm by 7 cm and about 1.5 to 2 cm thick, which is typical for waffles, but sweet potato waffles tend to be denser due to the ingredient. Step 3: Density considerations. Sweet potato waffles are denser than regular waffles made purely from flour and eggs, so will be heavier, roughly comparable to a small dense baked good. Step 4: Portion size calibration. Each piece is a quarter of a whole waffle, so total waffle size is similar to a normal single waffle approximately 14 cm square and 1.5 cm thick. A regular wheat waffle of that size weighs about 120-140g, so a sweet potato waffle would likely weigh a bit more due to higher density, about 140-160g total. Step 5: Cross-validation with visual cues. The plate and sauce help confirm size. The waffle pieces are solid and slightly thick, so total weight of the waffle is about 150g. Since the question asks for the weight of the sweet potato waffle only, excluding cream and salmon, I estimate 150 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food item is 'fraises' (strawberries). There are exactly 3 strawberries clearly visible in a small bowl. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The strawberries vary in size but are quite large compared to the bowl, which seems to be a small dipping bowl about 8-10 cm in diameter. Each strawberry looks larger than average, around 5-6 cm in length and plump, suggesting a significant volume. Step 3: Density Considerations - Strawberries are fruit with skin, moderately dense but mostly water, each strawberry typically ranges from 15 to 30 grams depending on size. Given the visible size, these are large strawberries likely towards the upper end. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - With 3 large strawberries, the weight per strawberry likely averages around 28 grams. Multiplying 3 × 28 = 84 grams. This represents a medium to large portion for strawberries, appropriate for Swiss portions which tend smaller than US but these are notably large berries. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The bowl size and strawberry sizes confirm this weight is reasonable; 84 grams is consistent with visual bulk without overestimation. Therefore, the estimated total weight of the strawberries is 84 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification: The target food is riz (rice). In the image, the rice occupies roughly half of the bowl's interior. It appears as a white steamed portion, separated distinctly from the dalh de lentilles corail. Step 2: Dimension Analysis: The bowl is a standard small to medium-sized cereal bowl, about 12-15 cm in diameter. The rice portion appears compact and forms a mound about 3-4 cm high, occupying half the bowl surface. Step 3: Density Considerations: Cooked white rice is dense and moist, usually about 130-140 grams per cup (cooked). Its volume is substantially preserved when cooked. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration: Considering the size of the bowl and the amount of rice visible (a half bowl), this appears to be a medium portion typically served in Swiss context, slightly smaller than US portions. A half bowl of cooked rice would roughly equal 120-150 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation: The rice portion is not overloaded but reasonably fills half the bowl. Given the depth and compactness, 130 grams is a good estimate ensuring we are not over or underestimating. Therefore, the estimated weight of the rice is 130 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is pineapple (ananas). There are 14 visible pieces of fresh pineapple, cut into medium-sized triangular chunks. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The pieces are on a medium plate, allowing size comparison. Each piece is roughly 3-4 cm in length, about 2 cm thick, and around 2 cm wide. Each chunk is moderately thick, suggesting decent volume. Step 3: Density Considerations - Pineapple has a medium density, being a juicy fruit, slightly less dense than water but still substantial. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given the 14 medium-sized pieces distributed on the plate, this portion looks like a small-to-medium Swiss serving size. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Considering all chunks and their approximate volume, typical density (~0.5-0.6 g/cm³), the estimated weight per chunk is about 20 g on average. Multiplying 14 pieces × 20 g equals approximately 280 g. Given some size variability and approximation, the estimate is adjusted slightly down to 250 g to remain conservative and grounded in visual evidence."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food item 'pain aux fruits' is a small piece of fruit bread held between two fingers. It is a single piece, not mixed or layered with other foods. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Judging by the size relative to the fingers, the piece is roughly 5 cm wide, 5 cm tall, and about 2 cm thick, giving a small volume. Step 3: Density Considerations - Fruit bread is moderately dense with dried fruit embedded, which increases weight compared to plain bread but it’s moderate overall. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - This appears to be a small to medium-sized piece usually found as a snack portion in Switzerland. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Considering typical pieces of fruit bread and the visible thickness and density, a small portion typically weighs around 40 to 60 grams. Given the size and density shown here, a weight towards the middle of this range is appropriate. Therefore, the estimated weight is 50 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is ""pain"" (bread). There are two slices on the plate, both roughly the same size. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each slice looks typical of a home-sliced sandwich bread, approximately 12 cm long, 8 cm wide, and about 1.5 cm thick. The slices appear relatively dense, with visible grain, which is consistent with Swiss-style bread. Step 3: Density Considerations - Bread density typically ranges around 0.25 to 0.3 grams/cm³. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - This is a typical single slice; since the user asked for ""pain"" (bread) as a general term, I assume the combined weight of both slices. Step 5: Cross-validation - Common store-bought bread slices weigh between 30 and 40 grams. Considering Swiss portions might be slightly smaller; estimating around 35 grams per slice is reasonable. Two slices total: 70 grams. Therefore, the best visual weight estimate for the total bread (two slices) on the plate is about 70 grams."
xjvrtk,kiwi,120.0,75.0,45.0,0.8507956514888924,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/7d1aaf24-b020-4315-aa15-db38f40e72be,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, I locate the kiwi in the image: it consists of many sliced pieces covering about half of a small bowl. Counting the pieces, I see approximately 16 visible kiwi slices. These slices are thin, roughly 0.5 to 1 cm thick, and moderately sized. A whole kiwi typically weighs about 70-80g in Swiss portions, and the pieces visible here appear to be close to one whole kiwi peeled and sliced with the skin removed. Considering the typical density of kiwi fruit, which is mostly water, its density is close to 1 g/cm³. The bowl is a small dessert-size bowl, thus the volume of kiwi corresponds roughly to a whole kiwi’s flesh. There is no visible leftover or major pieces hidden, so the estimate includes almost the entire fruit flesh. Taking into account slight cutting losses, I estimate the kiwi flesh weight is about 75 grams, which fits a medium portion for a whole Swiss kiwi."

The target food item is mozzarella. Step 1: Visual Identification - The mozzarella is on the left side of the plate, appearing as a single medium-sized ball or portion. It is smooth, white, and creamy, clearly distinct from the olives and salad. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Comparing the mozzarella to the olives, which are roughly 2-3 cm each, the mozzarella portion appears to be roughly 7-8 cm in diameter and about 1.5-2 cm thick. The mozzarella is relatively flat with some slight curvature, typical for fresh mozzarella balls. Step 3: Density Considerations - Mozzarella cheese has a density around 1 g/cm³, slightly denser than water. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - This looks like a typical Swiss portion size, somewhat smaller than US portions. Mozzarella balls commonly weigh about 100-125g for standard portions. Given the size and the plate context, this serves as a medium portion. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The mozzarella portion is roughly the size of a small palm, visually consistent with about 110g. Taking all into account, the estimated weight is about 110 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food item is chili, which appears as a mixture of kidney beans, pieces of cervelas, and sauce, occupying approximately half of the plate. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The plate is a standard small Swiss plate (~22 cm diameter). The chili portion covers roughly half the plate surface, with a thickness of about 2-3 cm, considering it looks piled but not very deep. Step 3: Density Considerations - Chili contains dense components: cooked cervelas (meat), beans, and sauce. The density is moderate to high due to meat and beans being compact. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given the visual size, this chili portion looks medium-large but appropriate for a Swiss meal portion. A typical medium chili portion on a plate of this size weighs around 200-250 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - The visible beans and cervelas pieces amount to a hearty portion, confirming the estimate is reasonable. Therefore, the estimated weight of the chili on the plate is about 230 grams."

The target food item is 'tomates'. Step 1: Visual Identification - The tomatoes are cut into roughly 10 chunks scattered on the plate. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each tomato piece is around 2-3 cm in length and appears slightly thick, around 1.5-2 cm deep. The pieces collectively cover a small area but are stacked with some depth. Step 3: Density Considerations - Tomatoes are moderately dense, with juice and pulp but lighter than firm vegetables due to water content. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The tomato portion looks like a small to medium side serving typical in Swiss portions. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Considering the pieces count, size, and typical density, a medium portion of tomatoes cut this way would weigh about 70-90 grams. The visual size is closer to a medium portion on this plate. Therefore, a reasonable estimate is around 80 grams for the tomatoes on the plate."
ppf8hc,crème caramel,115.0,90.0,25.0,0.45296990704269735,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/7ba1f50a-fb62-4e65-89ea-a193ab96c0db,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. STEP 1: The target food is crème caramel, which is the creamy custard-like light yellow portion in the blue bowl. There is one visible portion, contained within the bowl. STEP 2: The bowl is held in a hand, allowing size comparison. The bowl diameter is about 12-14 cm, typical for a small dessert bowl. The crème caramel portion is about 7-8 cm in diameter and approximately 1.5 to 2 cm thick, judging by the visible volume and depth of the creamy custard. STEP 3: Considering crème caramel is a custard made from milk, eggs, and sugar, its density is close to that of thick cream or yogurt, roughly 1 g/cm3. The visible volume approximates a shallow disc: volume = π × (radius)^2 × height ≈ 3.14 × (4 cm)^2 × 1.75 cm ≈ 88 cm3. STEP 4: Given the typical Swiss portion sizes are slightly smaller than US ones, this portion is medium-small. The weight estimate therefore aligns closely with the volume in milliliters and grams (since density ~1 g/cm3). The estimated weight range could be 80-100 grams, selecting a medium portion around 90 grams. STEP 5: Cross-validation: The quantity is consistent with a single serving from a homemade or restaurant crème caramel, not too large or sparse. There are no hidden or layered sections beyond what is visible, so no adjustment is necessary. Final estimated weight: 90 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food item is 'yogourt figue sans sucre' visible as a small plastic cup of fig-flavored yogurt without added sugar. The yogurt fills most of the cup, which is a single container. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The cup is approximately the size of typical Swiss yogurt containers, which are usually smaller than US portions. By comparing the cup to the nearby fork, the height of the cup is about 7-8 cm and diameter is around 6-7 cm. Such cups typically hold around 125 grams of yogurt. Step 3: Density Considerations - Yogurt is a dense dairy product similar in density to water, so volume in ml closely corresponds to grams. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Since this is a single serving and the cup looks nearly full, and Swiss portions for yogurts are generally in the 100-150 gram range, this is a medium portion around 125 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The yogurt is not partially consumed, there's no visible reduction. The packaging and size look consistent with a standard individual yogurt pot. Therefore, based solely on visual evidence and Swiss portion context, the weight of this yogurt is estimated at 125 grams."

STEP 1: The target food item is 'fromages (manchego, 2 sortes de gruyères, raclette)'. Visually, there are four distinct cheese slices on the plate, three rectangular slices and one smaller piece, likely representing the different types mentioned. STEP 2: Dimension analysis shows that each cheese slice is roughly about 4-5 cm in length and about 1.5-2 cm in width, with an estimated thickness of about 0.3 cm. Comparing with the slice of bread on the same plate supports the size estimate. The cheeses are solid and dense, typical for these varieties. STEP 3: Density considerations - cheese is dense and weighs more than it looks. Typical cheese density is around 1.1 g/cm³. STEP 4: Calculating volume approximately: Each slice is about 5 cm x 2 cm x 0.3 cm = 3 cm³. There are 4 pieces giving about 12 cm³ total volume. Using density 1.1 g/cm³ gives about 13.2 g total. STEP 5: Portion size calibration - the quantity looks like a small to medium portion commonly served as a cheese tasting. Given some variation in slice size, the weight should be around 12 to 16 grams. Cross validation with typical cheese servings suggests this estimate is reasonable for Swiss contexts where portions are smaller than US sizes. Therefore, the final estimate is 14 grams for the total cheese portion visible."

Step 1: The target food is 'muesli nature' visible as the granola-like cereal on top of the yogurt. It is spread over the surface of the bowl, covering most of it, with some depth evident especially at the edges. Step 2: The bowl is a small to medium size (approx. 12-15 cm diameter). The muesli layer appears to be about 1.5 to 2 cm thick on average with some clustering suggesting a small variation in density. Step 3: Muesli is relatively dense, typically around 0.3-0.35 g/cm3 when loosely packed. Step 4: Rough volume estimation: Assuming a roughly 13 cm diameter circle, area is about 133 cm2. Depth approx 1.8 cm gives volume ~ 240 cm3. Multiplying by density 0.33 g/cm3 yields about 79 grams. Considering a Swiss portion size which tends to be conservative, this can be adjusted to a medium portion around 70-80 grams. Step 5: Cross validation: The muesli layer is substantial but not heaped or overflowing, so approximately 75 grams is reasonable and consistent with typical serving sizes for muesli as a breakfast topper. No container weight is included, only the muesli itself. Therefore, the estimated weight for the 'muesli nature' in this image is 75 grams."
m4egh2,sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon),98.0,120.0,22.0,0.3396880415944541,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/6b91ac4b-1f0f-4176-bf40-a12a6cd892e2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. STEP 1: VISUAL IDENTIFICATION - The target food is the mushroom sauce (crème + ail + champignon). The sauce clearly coats the mushrooms and pasta, but the visible mushrooms (about 7 pieces) are embedded in creamy sauce, mostly visible on the pasta surface. STEP 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS - The mushrooms appear to be sliced moderately thick (about 0.5 to 1 cm thickness), with a total visible volume covering the pasta portion. The bowl is a medium-sized container. The sauce likely fills gaps around pasta and mushrooms but is not overly abundant. STEP 3: DENSITY CONSIDERATIONS - Mushroom sauce made of cream, garlic, and mushrooms is relatively dense but includes some liquid cream, so the density is moderate medium. Mushrooms themselves add some solid matter, cream adds volume but less density. STEP 4: PORTION SIZE CALIBRATION - Considering the size of mushrooms and creamy texture coating the pasta, the sauce quantity seems to be a moderate portion. Estimating the sauce quantity by mushroom volume plus cream estimated around 100 to 140 g. Given moderate coverage, a middle-range 120 g is suitable. STEP 5: CROSS-VALIDATION - Sauce is visible mainly around mushrooms and pasta; the total volume corresponds roughly to what would realistically be served in such a bowl. This estimate avoids overcounting cream alone, focusing on the whole sauce portion with mushrooms. Therefore, the estimated weight of the mushroom sauce (crème + ail + champignon) is 120 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food item is 'tonic au gingembre,' which corresponds to the ginger tonic water in a glass bottle prominently displayed in the image. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The bottle is a small glass tonic water bottle, roughly the size of classic European single-serving glass bottles, which typically range from 200ml to 250ml in volume based on its height relative to the water glass and smartphone on the table. Step 3: Density Considerations - Since this is a liquid, density is close to water, approximately 1g/ml, so the weight in grams aligns closely with the volume in milliliters. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given the bottle appears unopened or full, the liquid content inside is likely close to the full volume of the bottle, so about 200-250 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - Comparing with common tonic water bottles in Swiss cafes, a typical single-serving glass bottle is around 200ml, which is a reasonable and conservative estimate accounting for visual scaling to hands and objects nearby. Therefore, the estimated weight of the ginger tonic water liquid inside the bottle is approximately 220 grams, considering slight variation in bottle size. Container weight is excluded as required."

Step 1: Visual Identification. The target food is 'fromage' (cheese). In the image, there are approximately 6 slices or strips of cheese placed side by side on one slice of bread. Step 2: Dimension Analysis. Each cheese strip appears about 8 cm long, 1.5 cm wide, and about 2-3 mm thick. The bread slice is standard-sized Swiss bread, approximately 10-11 cm long. Step 3: Density Considerations. Cheese is a dense food and heavier per volume compared to bread or vegetables. Typical semi-hard cheese density is around 1.0 g/cm3. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration. Estimating the volume: 6 strips × (8 cm × 1.5 cm × 0.25 cm) = 6 × 3 cm3 = 18 cm3. At 1 g/cm3, this corresponds to approximately 18 g of cheese. Considering some variation in thickness and exact size, a reasonable estimate is between 15 g and 22 g. The portion shown looks medium, so 18 g is a good estimate. Step 5: Cross-validation. The weight seems reasonable to cover the slice of bread without significant thickness. No container weight included. Therefore, the estimated weight for the cheese on the bread is 18 grams."

Step 1: The target food item is 'boule de glace vanille' (vanilla ice cream scoop). Visually, there is one distinct scoop of vanilla ice cream in the bowl. Step 2: Dimension analysis shows the scoop to be roughly standard size for a single scoop of ice cream, approximately 5 cm diameter, which is typical for Swiss portions and slightly smaller than US portions. Step 3: Considering density, ice cream is lighter than water but denser than whipped cream or mousse, with typical density around 0.5 to 0.6 grams per cubic centimeter. A 5 cm diameter sphere has a volume calculated by (4/3)*pi*(2.5)^3 = ~65 cm3. Multiplying by 0.55 g/cm3 average gives about 35-36 grams. Step 4: Portion size calibration indicates this is a medium scoop, not overly large or small. Step 5: Cross-validation confirms this estimation matches visual size and density. Chocolate sauce and compote do not affect the ice cream weight estimation as per the instructions. Conclusion: The vanilla ice cream scoop weighs approximately 35 grams."

Step 1: The target food item is 'avocat' (avocado). Looking at the image, there is one piece of avocado located towards the top left of the wrap, sliced into a roughly crescent shape. Step 2: Dimension analysis shows the avocado slice is about 7-8 cm long and approximately 2-3 cm wide at its thickest part, with visible thickness around 1-1.5 cm. This corresponds to roughly one quarter of a medium-sized avocado half. Comparing to the plate and cutlery, it is a small portion. Step 3: Avocado has a moderate density with creamy texture, approximately 0.96 g/cm3. Step 4: Typical weight of a whole medium avocado is about 150-170 g including skin; edible portion is about 70-80% of that. Here the avocado portion is roughly 1/4 of half an avocado, meaning about 1/8 of a whole avocado. That is about 18-20 g. Step 5: Cross-validation with the size relative to the other ingredients confirms this is a small slice, consistent with a weight estimate in this range. Therefore, a reasonable estimation for the avocado weight is 20 grams."

The target food item is 'sauce'. Step 1: Visual identification—The sauce is the brown liquid spread around the plate beneath and surrounding the meat, carrots, and mashed potatoes. Step 2: Dimension analysis—The sauce appears to be a thin layer on the plate, roughly covering an area approximately the size of the plate's inner bottom (about 20 cm diameter). The sauce layer is thin, estimated at about 2-3 mm thickness. Step 3: Density considerations—Sauce is mostly water-based with some solids; density close to water (~1 g/ml). Step 4: Portion size calibration—Given the area covered (circle about 20cm diameter gives roughly 314 cm² area) and estimated thickness 0.25 cm, volume is about 314cm² * 0.25 cm = roughly 78 ml. This translates to about 78 grams of sauce. Step 5: Cross-validation—This matches a reasonable sauce serving for a Swiss portion, as it lightly coats the food without forming a deep pool. Therefore, the estimated weight for the sauce is 78 grams."

The target food item is 'galette wraps'. First, visually identify the galette wrap: it is the large flat circular wheat wrap serving as the base for all the toppings. From the image, it is roughly comparable in size to a medium plate (about 20-22 cm diameter). Galette wraps in Switzerland tend to be thin and lighter than US tortillas. A standard whole wheat galette wrap of this size typically weighs between 40 and 60 grams. Given the thinness and size visible, this looks like a medium-sized galette wrap, not overly thick. Therefore, I estimate the weight in the middle of that range, around 50 grams. No additional layers are hidden, no doubling, so no adjustment needed. Container weight is excluded since it is on a plate. Thus, the best estimate based purely on visual size and standard portion sizes for Swiss galette wraps is around 50 grams."

First, the target food item is a single peeled carrot visible in the image, placed on a granite countertop. The carrot appears to be medium-sized, typical for standard carrots. It is fully visible, straight, and uncut. Carrot length is estimated around 15-18 cm based on typical kitchen counter textures and visible reflections. The average diameter seems consistent with a medium carrot, about 3-4 cm. Considering density of peeled raw carrot (dense vegetable), it weighs more than it might visually appear. Standard medium peeled carrots weigh between 70-90 grams in Swiss portion context. Given the carrot shown has no visible defects or drying, I estimate this carrot towards the mid-size range, about 80 grams. No other items or cut pieces need to be considered. Therefore, the best estimate for the peeled carrot weight is 80 grams."

First, I locate the target food item, caviar d'aubergine, which is the spread on the slice of bread at the top right of the plate. It is a single slice of seeded bread with a thin but visible layer of the eggplant spread on top. The slice of bread is typical of a Swiss-style small portion bread, roughly 10 cm long and about 5 cm wide. The spread layer looks moderately thick but not heavily piled, approximately 0.3 to 0.5 cm in depth as it is evenly spread. Given the nature of caviar d'aubergine (a cooked, mostly water-based purée), it is moderately dense but lighter than cheese. By volume, this corresponds to roughly 15 to 25 grams of spread, considering the coverage and thickness, with a medium portion assumption based on the relatively small slice of bread. Therefore, I estimate the weight of caviar d'aubergine in this slice to be about 20 grams."

Step 1: The target food is 'bout de gruyère' (piece of Gruyère cheese), which is the single rectangular piece of yellow cheese on the plate. It is fully visible and not mixed with other items. Step 2: Dimension analysis - the cheese piece is approximately the length of the croissants next to it, roughly 10 cm long, about 2 cm wide, and appears to be around 1.5 cm thick. Step 3: Density considerations - Gruyère cheese is a dense cheese with typical density about 1.1 g/cm³. Step 4: Calculate volume: length (10 cm) × width (2 cm) × thickness (1.5 cm) = 30 cm³. Multiplying by density 1.1 g/cm³ gives approximately 33 grams. Considering Swiss portion tendency to be moderate, this piece looks like a small to medium portion, so I estimate around 30-35 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - given the visible size and density of Gruyère, this estimate seems reasonable and aligns with typical portion sizes served. No container weight is included."

Step 1: The target food item is 'pain' (bread). The image shows one slice of bread with nutella spread on it. Step 2: Dimension analysis - The bread slice covers almost half of a standard dessert plate (approximately 20 cm diameter). The slice is about 10-12 cm long and 7-8 cm wide. Thickness is about 1.5-2 cm. Step 3: Density considerations - Bread is moderately dense but overall relatively light. Swiss portions tend to be smaller than US. Step 4: Portion size calibration - Given the single slice and size visible, this appears to be a medium to slightly large single portion slice. Typical slice weight for whole grain or country-style bread ranges from 30-50 grams. Given thickness and size, this slice is likely around 40 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - The slice does not seem overly thick or thin and matches typical store-bought bread slices in Europe/Switzerland. Therefore, 40 grams is a reasonable estimate based on visual evidence."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The 'sauce oignons' is visible as a reddish-brown sauce with cooked onion slices covering the slice of roast beef on the left side of the plate. It appears as a thin layer spread over the meat, not a separate pile. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The sauce layer roughly covers a 10 cm by 7 cm area corresponding to the roast beef slice, with a visible thickness of approximately 2-3 mm, considering it is a liquid sauce with onions. Step 3: Density Considerations - Given that onion sauce is moist and liquid, its density is near that of water but slightly higher due to sugars and onions. Onions in sauce add modest weight, and the volume is limited by the sauce layer. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The sauce portion is small to medium; typical onion sauce servings on roast in Switzerland would be about 30-50 grams. Considering the visual amount, approximately a medium portion near 40 grams is a reasonable estimate. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Avoiding overestimation by considering sauce layer thinness and limited volume, and factoring density, 40 grams aligns well with the visual evidence and typical portion sizes in Swiss context."

The target food item is 'yogourt orange sanguine'. In the image, the yogurt is mixed with the cereal and blueberries in a medium-sized bowl. The yogurt is the creamy liquid base in which the cereals and blueberries are immersed, so we must estimate the total volume of this mixture and then deduce the yogurt weight portion. The bowl is roughly 15-18 cm in diameter and about 5-6 cm deep, filled about halfway with the mixture. The cereal and blueberries take some volume, but yogurt forms the majority of the content. Given the Swiss portion context, this looks like a medium breakfast portion. The cereal mixture itself is dense but light; blueberries are small and few, not displacing much yogurt. The total content in the bowl is approximately 250-300g based on bowl size and visual fullness. Yogurt likely constitutes around 60-70% of this bowl because cereal is flaky and blueberries are sparse; thus, yogurt weight is about 150-210g. Given the medium portion appearance, I select about 180g as the estimated yogurt weight in the mixture."

Step 2: Dimension analysis shows half an egg, typical size for a small to medium egg commonly found in Swiss portions. A whole hard-boiled egg usually weighs between 50-60g; half would then be 25-30g. The egg white and yolk are dense, contributing to the weight. Step 3: Density considerations confirm that the boiled egg is dense, so the visually small size still corresponds to a decent weight. Step 4: Portion size calibration indicates since it's half an egg visible, the weight corresponds to about half the whole egg's weight, so around 28g. Step 5: Cross-validation against the plate size and other ingredients suggests this estimate is reasonable and not over- or underestimated. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'oeuf' piece is approximately 28 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food item is 'haricots rouges' (red kidney beans). They are located on the left side of the plate, comprising a neat pile of individual beans. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The red kidney beans appear to cover a surface area roughly comparable to a small handful. Comparing to the pasta spirals and green beans on the plate, the pile spans about 6-7 cm in length and 4-5 cm in width with a modest depth of about 1.5-2 cm. Step 3: Density Considerations - Kidney beans are quite dense and heavy for their volume. Cooked kidney beans typically weigh about 240-260 g per cup (approx. 250 ml volume). The pile here seems to be around half a cup or slightly less. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given Swiss portion norms and the visual evidence, this amount corresponds roughly to a small to medium portion of cooked kidney beans. Step 5: Cross Validation - Avoiding common errors, the beans do not appear overcounted, and depth is accounted for conservatively. Thus, I estimate the weight of the haricots rouges on this plate to be about 100 grams."

Step 1: The target food item is 'gaufre' (waffle). In the image, there is one rectangular waffle present on a small plate. Step 2: The waffle is roughly the size of a typical children's or small breakfast waffle, about 10 cm by 7 cm, and about 1.5 cm thick. The waffle is not topped heavily, so no additional weight besides the waffle itself. Step 3: Waffles are moderately dense due to the cooked batter structure; they are not as dense as solid baked goods but denser than fruits or vegetables. Step 4: Swiss portions tend to be smaller; a typical single small to medium square waffle weighs around 50-70 grams. Step 5: Given the size and visual thickness, this waffle corresponds to a medium portion, closer to the lower end of the range due to moderate thickness. Thus, the estimated weight is about 55 grams. Cross-checking, this is reasonable visually for a Swiss portion-sized waffle on a standard plate. Therefore, the waffle weight is estimated at 55 grams."

First, I identify the target food item: myrtilles (blueberries). The blueberries are located on the left side of the bowl, grouped closely with raspberries. I count approximately 12 visible blueberries. The blueberries vary slightly in size but appear medium-sized, typical for fresh blueberries. The plate is a standard bowl held by hand; comparing the blueberries to the hand and the portion of porridge, each blueberry is about 1.2 to 1.5 cm in diameter. Blueberries have a density of roughly 0.7 g per berry considering the water content. Estimating around 12 berries times approximately 1.3 g per berry yields roughly 16 grams. Considering some might be partially hidden or overlapped, this count seems accurate without significant underestimation. Swiss portion size suggests a moderate serving here, so I stay conservative and do not add extra for hidden berries. Therefore, the estimated weight of the visible blueberries is about 16 grams."

The target food is purée cacahuète (peanut butter). Visually, the peanut butter portion is located at the bottom left of the plate, appearing as a smooth creamy dollop approximately 5 cm long and about 3 cm wide with a moderate thickness. Compared to the banana segment (about half a banana) and chocolate chips, the peanut butter portion is relatively small. Peanut butter is dense and calorie-rich, so a small volume corresponds to a substantial weight. Considering the size and depth, the portion looks like a typical small serving, likely around 1 heaping tablespoon. A heaping tablespoon of peanut butter typically weighs about 20 grams, but Swiss portions tend to be smaller. The visible portion in the image is moderate, so estimating around 18 grams is reasonable, balancing visual volume and density. Therefore, the estimated weight for the purée cacahuète is 18 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification. The target food is 'porc' (pork). In the image, the pork piece is located on the left side of the container underneath a white creamy mustard sauce. It is a single piece, fairly thick and rectangular in shape. Step 2: Dimension Analysis. Comparing to the container which seems like a standard small lunch box (around 15 cm width), the pork piece is approximately 8 cm long, 5 cm wide, and around 1.5 cm thick beneath the sauce. Step 3: Density Considerations. Pork meat is dense and cooked, so it would weigh about 1.0 to 1.1 g/cm³. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration. Volume = 8 cm × 5 cm × 1.5 cm = 60 cm³. Weight estimate = 60 g (assuming density roughly equals 1 g/cm³). The sauce on top is excluded as per instructions. Step 5: Cross-Validation. A typical small portion of cooked pork for lunch in Switzerland is around 50-80g. This visual portion matches a conservative medium portion size, so 60g is reasonable. Considering some uncertainty, 60g is a well-grounded estimate."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food item is one piece of dark chocolate. It is one segment, slightly broken on the edges but mostly intact. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Compared to standard portion sizes of Swiss chocolate bars, each segment typically weighs between 8 to 15 grams. Visually judging the size against the plain background and typical individual segment volume, it looks slightly smaller than a full intact segment but not by much. Step 3: Density Considerations - Dark chocolate is relatively dense, so even small volume pieces have considerable weight. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - This is a single piece from a bar, so it can be considered a small to medium portion with slight breakage. Assigning a value near the lower-mid segment weight range. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Avoid underestimating as density is high, and the visible size is about three quarters of a full segment. Thus assigning 10 grams is reasonable and conservative given the piece's visible size and density."

First, the target food item is 'banane' and the image shows a partially peeled banana segment lying on a flat surface. The visible banana portion is about half or slightly less of a typical banana length. A standard medium banana in Switzerland weighs around 120-150g whole. Since this piece looks like approximately half or slightly less, we estimate around 60-75g based on length comparison and typical banana density. Banana density is relatively firm and dense, so weight corresponds well with visual size. There are no visible portions hidden from view as the banana is placed flat and peeled, so no adjustment for hidden mass is needed. Considering it is a Swiss context, the size is likely smaller than large US bananas, justifying a conservative estimate toward the lower-mid range. Therefore, a reasonable and precise estimate for this banana piece is about 70 grams."

Step 1: Visual identification identifies one single chocolate chip cookie, flat and round with visible large chocolate chunks. Step 2: Dimension analysis compares it to the wooden surface it rests on; the cookie appears roughly 7-8 cm in diameter and about 1-1.5 cm thick, typical for homemade or bakery-style cookies. Step 3: Density considerations note that cookies with oats and chocolate chunks are moderately dense but not heavy, with a crumbly texture and some air pockets. Step 4: Portion size calibration shows this is a medium Swiss-sized cookie, so it lies between 40-60 g typically. Step 5: Cross-validation avoids overestimation because of surface cracks and chocolate chunks; considering typical density and thickness, estimate around 50 g. This is a balanced judgment between size, density, and typical Swiss cookie portions."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food item is graines de courge (pumpkin seeds). Visually, the pumpkin seeds are scattered throughout the mixed couscous salad in small quantities. They appear as thin, flat, dark green pieces embedded within the salad. There are multiple small pieces evenly distributed but they are sparse. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The container is about a typical glass lunch box, approximately 15cm x 15cm x 6cm. The pumpkin seeds are very thin and small, likely around 1-2 cm long and a few millimeters thick, but scattered in small amounts mostly on the top and middle. Step 3: Density Considerations - Pumpkin seeds are dense and heavy relative to their small size, but here they are not densely packed, just sprinkled. The total visible volume of the seeds is quite small compared to the overall salad volume. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given the scattered, sparse distribution, this looks like a small to medium portion of pumpkin seeds in the dish. For example, a small handful of pumpkin seeds (about 15g) would look more dense. Here, seeds are more like 1-2 tablespoons in volume. Step 5: Cross validation - Given typical densities and visual volume, an estimate of about 8 grams is reasonable for the visible pumpkin seeds in this portion. This excludes the container and any ambiguity. Therefore, the estimated weight of graines de courge in this dish is approximately 8 grams."

The target food item is 'vinaigre balsamique'. Step 1: Visually identify the balsamic vinegar in the image. It appears as a dark brown liquid drizzled on top of the salad in the white bowl. Step 2: Assess the amount by comparing to salad size and bowl size. The bowl is a small to medium-sized salad bowl, about 10-12 cm in diameter. The balsamic vinegar is visible as thin lines across the top with some small pools on the radishes and tomato pieces. The total volume looks like a light drizzle, not a heavy pour, roughly less than 1 tablespoon (15 ml). Step 3: Density considerations. Balsamic vinegar has a density close to water, about 1.2 g/ml. Therefore, the weight in grams is roughly the volume in ml times 1.2. Step 4: Portion size calibration. The total balsamic vinegar is likely between 5 to 10 ml, so weight ranges from 6 to 12 grams approximately. The drizzle appears moderate but not very heavy, so the mid to lower end is more reasonable. Step 5: Cross-validation. The balsamic vinegar is only on the surface and is not pooled heavily. Therefore, estimate on the lower side around 7 grams is appropriate. Container weight is excluded as per instructions. Final estimation: approximately 7 grams of vinaigre balsamique."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is 'noix de cajou' (cashew nuts). The image shows a total of 17 cashew nuts held in a person's palm. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Comparing to the hand size and typical cashew nut dimensions, each cashew nut appears to be standard size, about 2-3 cm long. They are whole and not broken, hence full-size nuts. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cashew nuts are dense and fatty, with an approximate density close to other nuts; a single cashew nut typically weighs around 1.3-1.5 grams. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - For 17 nuts, typical weight per nut is about 1.4 grams on average, leading to an expected weight range between 17 × 1.3 = 22.1 g to 17 × 1.5 = 25.5 g. This is a medium portion, leaning slightly towards lower-medium because the handful fits comfortably in the palm without overflowing. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The nuts appear dry and whole, no broken pieces or extra volume. The pile depth is 1 layer in the palm, so no hidden pieces. The overall estimate is robust. Hence, the best estimate weight for the visible cashew nuts is approximately 24 grams."

The target food item is 'oignon', which visually corresponds to the green chopped pieces scattered on top of the ham slice on the bread. Step 1: Visual Identification – The oignon pieces are finely chopped green onion parts, roughly about 12-15 small pieces spread across the ham. Step 2: Dimension Analysis – Each piece appears small, around 0.5 to 1 cm in length and thin. Total volume is low given their small size and sparse distribution. Step 3: Density Considerations – Green onions have a low density but still weigh some grams due to water content. Step 4: Portion Size – This appears to be a small garnish portion, typical for one serving – likely around 5-8 grams max. Step 5: Cross-Validation – The chopped oignon volume is minimal, and green onions generally weigh around 20-25g per 100cm3. Given the visual indication and Swiss portion context, a conservative estimate is about 6 grams. Therefore, the weight of the oignon present on this plate is best estimated at 6 grams."

The target food item is 'graines de chia'. Step 1: Visual Identification - The chia seeds are visible as small black dots dispersed throughout the mixture in the bowl, mixed evenly with the blanc battu, flocons d'avoine, and a bit of honey. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The bowl is medium-sized (typical cereal bowl), and the chia seeds appear well distributed but not in large quantity, mostly a thin spread mixed in rather than piled. Estimated total chia seeds volume is low, roughly a thin layer amounting to a few grams. Step 3: Density Considerations - Chia seeds are dense and small. A teaspoon (~5 grams) of dry chia weighs approximately 5g. In the image, the amount looks less than a teaspoon, roughly half that or slightly more. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Since it looks like a small-medium sprinkle mixed into the blanc battu and oats, the reasonable estimate range is 2-4g with most likely near 3g. Step 5: Cross-validation - The chia seeds are visible but not heavily concentrated or mounded, so overestimation should be avoided. The estimate here is conservative and consistent with typical serving sizes of chia seeds added to such yogurt mixtures. Therefore, final estimate for 'graines de chia' is 3 grams."

Step 1: Identify the target food item, which is 'chocolat' represented here by two chocolate bunny figures. I count two individual chocolate bunnies. Step 2: For dimension analysis, the bunnies are small, likely a portion for seasonal chocolate treats like Easter. Each chocolate bunny appears to be about 4-5 cm tall and roughly 2.5-3 cm wide, typical of small hollow or solid milk chocolate figurines. Depth is about the same as width, indicating a roughly solid shape, not too hollow. Step 3: Considering density, milk chocolate has a density close to 1.3 g/cm³. For a solid piece of this size, weight is moderately heavy compared to volume. Step 4: In Switzerland, chocolate portions tend to be small individually. Common small chocolate bunnies for Easter weigh around 25-40 grams each. Since these are small and not large solid sculptures, a medium small size of about 30 grams per bunny is reasonable. Step 5: Cross-validation and error checks show these bunnies are standard small chocolate shapes, not oversized. Total weight is for one chocolate bunny as requested. Therefore, estimated weight for one 'chocolat' bunny is about 30 grams."

The target food is 'tartine avec crème de marrons et beurre'. Step 1: Visual Identification — I see one small slice of toasted bread (tartine) with visible spread of chestnut cream (crème de marrons) and butter. The entire slice is covered sparsely but recognizably by both spreads. Step 2: Dimension Analysis — The toast is relatively small, roughly the size of a children's or breakfast bread slice. Compared to the plate, it appears about 8-9 cm long and 4-5 cm wide. Thickness looks moderate, around 1-1.5 cm. Step 3: Density Considerations — Bread is moderately dense; a small slice of about this size generally weighs around 25-30g. The chestnut cream is dense and pasty, but the amount spread here is thin, covering only the surface area with a thin layer (~2-3 mm thick). Butter parts are thin pats, also sparse. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration — The size matches a small to medium slice of bread with thin spread amounts. Butter spread might be about 3-4g, chestnut cream about 10-12g. Step 5: Cross-Validation — Adding the bread (approx 27g) plus chestnut cream (12g) plus butter (4g) gives roughly 43g. Given the visual sparsity of spreads, lower-end estimates are reasonable. Therefore, a fair estimate of the entire tartine with crème de marrons et beurre is about 43 grams total. Since the food item is the tartine WITH the spreads, the entire unit is considered."

Step 1: The target food item is crème de marrons, visible spread on a piece of bread. Step 2: The bread slice is roughly the size of a small to medium slice of baguette, approximately 10 cm long and 3-4 cm wide, with crème de marrons spread only on the top surface. Thickness of the spread looks thin to moderate, about 0.3-0.5 cm thick. Step 3: Crème de marrons is a dense chestnut spread, somewhat viscous and sticky, placing its density similar to thick jam, roughly around 1.3 g/cm3. Step 4: Estimating the covered surface area of the crème de marrons around 30 cm2 (considering spread area on top of the bread slice). Volume = area x thickness = 30 cm2 x 0.4 cm = 12 cm3. Given density ~1.3 g/cm3, estimated weight = 12 x 1.3 = 15.6 g. Considering slight irregularities and edges, reasonable estimation range is 13-18 g, settling on a medium portion of 16 g. Step 5: Cross-check for typical serving sizes of chestnut cream on baguette slices confirm that about 15-20 g is realistic for this visible portion. Hence, the estimated weight of crème de marrons is 16 grams."

The target food item is 'yogourt nature' which is the plain yogurt spread on a small slice of whole grain bread on the plate. Step 1: Visual Identification - The yogurt is the white creamy layer beneath the plum jam on the bread slice. The bread slice dimensions are roughly 10cm by 6cm (typical slice size), which helps gauge the volume of yogurt. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The yogurt layer appears to be around 5-7 mm thick on the bread, spread evenly. This suggests a thin but full coverage over the bread slice surface. Step 3: Density Considerations - Plain yogurt is dense, about 1.03g/ml. The volume can be approximated by area * thickness. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The area of the bread slice is approximately 60 cm², thickness about 0.6 cm (6mm), so volume is 60 * 0.6 = 36 ml, and density is near 1.03 g/ml. Therefore weight ≈ 36 * 1.03 = 37 grams. Given the spread is not fully thick everywhere, some areas thinner, rounding to about 35-40g is reasonable. Step 5: Cross-Validation - This aligns well with typical Swiss portions; it's a single slice with a yogurt layer for breakfast/snack. No container weight included. Therefore, the estimated weight of yogourt nature is about 37 grams."

First, visually identify the single cookie shown in the image. It is a chocolate chip cookie placed on a granite countertop, which gives a rough size comparison. The cookie appears to be of a medium size typical for a homemade or bakery chocolate chip cookie, roughly 7-8 cm in diameter. Considering the thickness is moderate, approximately 1-1.5 cm. Chocolate chip cookies are dense due to the sugar, butter, flour, and chocolate chunks, so the density is relatively high. Swiss portions for cookies tend to be slightly smaller than US portions. A typical medium chocolate chip cookie weighs between 40-50 grams. Given the visible size and chunkiness of the chocolate, I place this cookie at a medium portion, closer to 45 grams. Therefore, the estimated weight for this cookie is 45 grams."

The target food item is 'sauce curry avec mayonnaise.' Step 1: Visual Identification: The sauce curry with mayonnaise is the yellow spread visible inside the two sandwich halves. It appears layered beneath the chicken and on top of the bread and lettuce. Step 2: Dimension Analysis: The sauce covers about half the length of each sandwich, approximately 10 cm long and 3-4 cm wide based on the sandwich size. The sauce seems to have a thin spread depth of roughly 2-3 mm. Given there are two sandwiches on the plate, the total sauce is spread in two main sections. Step 3: Density Considerations: Sauces like curry mayonnaise are creamy and dense but light per volume. The density is approximately 0.9 to 1 g/cm3. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration: Estimating surface area of sauce per sandwich = 10 cm × 3.5 cm = 35 cm2. Depth ~ 0.25 cm gives a volume of about 35 cm2 × 0.25 cm = 8.75 cm3 per sandwich. For two sandwiches, total volume ~17.5 cm3. Using density ~1 g/cm3, estimated weight is ~17.5 grams. This matches a small to medium sauce portion for Swiss context, not very thick but enough to give visible color in both sandwiches. Step 5: Cross-Validation: The sauce does not appear very thick or excessively spread; estimate accounts for coverage and is conservative. Vessel/plate size confirms sandwich length around 15 cm, supporting dimensional assumptions. Therefore, the estimated total weight of the curry mayonnaise sauce in these two sandwiches is approximately 17 grams."

The target food is salade de céleri, located at the bottom-right corner of the plate. It appears as a small mound of shredded white celery root with visible texture. Compared to the plate size (standard square plate about 25 cm side) and the other items, the salade de céleri occupies a modest volume. Visually, it looks like about a small handful, roughly 1/8th of a cup, with some depth as it is piled. Celery root salads are moderately dense, shredded but moist, so weight per volume is relatively high compared to leafy items. Given the Swiss portion context, this is a side salad portion, likely between 40 and 60 grams. Considering the volume and density, a medium small portion of shredded celeriac salad here would reasonably be about 50 grams. Therefore, the estimated weight is 50 grams."

STEP 2: Using the hand as a size reference, the croissant measures approximately 10-12 cm in length, about 5-6 cm in width at the widest, and judging by its typical puff pastry layers and the visible thickness, it likely has a depth around 3-4 cm. STEP 3: Croissants are relatively light pastries but when filled with chocolate, the weight increases slightly. The presence of chocolate filling and nuts on top suggest an above-average weight compared to a plain croissant. STEP 4: Swiss portion sizes tend to be smaller than US; standard chocolate croissants in Switzerland often weigh between 70-90 grams depending on size and filling. Given the visible size slightly below average and the inclusion of nuts and chocolate, a medium portion estimate is appropriate. STEP 5: Cross-validation: The visible volume and density appear consistent with roughly 80 grams. The hand reference confirms this is not a jumbo croissant, nor is it a mini. Therefore, a reliable weight estimate for this croissant au chocolat is 80 grams."

STEP 1: VISUAL IDENTIFICATION - The target food item is mayonnaise. The mayonnaise is spread on one slice of pain bis bread. The coverage is thin and even, covering nearly the entire surface area of the bread slice. STEP 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS - The bread slice is approximately 12 cm long and 7-8 cm wide, standard for pain bis. The mayonnaise layer appears thin, roughly about 1-2 mm thick as a spread, not piled. STEP 3: DENSITY CONSIDERATIONS - Mayonnaise is relatively dense but spread thinly; its weight is proportional to surface coverage times thickness. STEP 4: PORTION SIZE CALIBRATION - For a thin spread over an entire slice of bread, typical portion sizes range between 10-20 g mayonnaise. This spread looks moderate, close to a medium portion, but not overly heavy. STEP 5: CROSS-VALIDATION - Given the bread size and coverage, it is unlikely to exceed 20 g but more than 10 g. Estimation: around 15 g of mayonnaise."
ppf8hc,feuilletés sauce tomate,21.0,22.0,1.0,0.003308649755790137,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/320b93f1-8b0b-42f3-84c6-2929825a090f,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food item is a single 'feuilleté sauce tomate,' visible alone on a wooden surface. It is a small, folded puff pastry with tomato sauce visible on one side. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The size relative to the wood grain pattern suggests it is a small appetizer-sized piece, roughly 3-4 cm in length and about 2-3 cm in width. The height is roughly 2 cm given the puff pastry layers visible. Step 3: Density Considerations - Puff pastry is flaky and slightly dense due to butter and layers, tomato sauce adds some moisture but overall the item is not very dense. The puff pastry will weigh more than an equivalent volume of plain bread because of fat content. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Typical small puff pastry pieces with tomato sauce served as appetizer portions usually weigh between 15g to 30g. Given the moderate size, it is likely closer to the medium portion, around 20-25g. Step 5: Cross-validation - The visible volume and common size for feuilleté appetizers align with this weight range. No container weight is included and the estimation is based solely on the visual size and typical Swiss appetizer portion sizes. Therefore, the best estimate is approximately 22 grams."
p96w4a,salade verte avec sauce,19.0,18.0,1.0,0.0029935402552386955,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/84905336-4de3-4568-8ab7-ad7669f93f6b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification - The image shows pieces of green salad leaves spread on a large white plate, with some dressing visible on the leaves and plate. There are about 6 to 8 medium-size leaves or leaf fragments visible. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The plate is a standard dinner plate (~25-27 cm diameter), and the salad leaves occupy a small central area, roughly 10 cm across in width and length. The leaves are mostly flat with slight curl, and there is a very thin layer of dressing, so no significant depth is added by sauce. Step 3: Density Considerations - Lettuce is very light and leafy; typical density is low, so weight comes mostly from volume of leaves. Sauce/dressing is thinly spread, so its contribution to weight is minimal and should not be counted as it is part of salad, but minimal in volume. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The amount shown is a small leftover portion, visually equivalent to a small side salad serving in Swiss context, generally less than a medium portion. A fresh small portion of green leafy salad weighs around 15-25 grams. The sauce contribution is minimal and can be disregarded per instructions. Step 5: Cross-validation - The visible salad is a small pile of leaves, not densely packed, so estimate toward lower end of small portion range is appropriate. Hence, final estimate is approximately 18 grams for the green salad with sauce present here."

Step 1: The target food item is 'thon' (tuna). Visually, there are several chunks of tuna scattered throughout the container, mixed with couscous and cucumber. Step 2: The container is a standard small glass lunchbox, roughly 15 cm wide and 6 cm deep. Tuna chunks appear to be roughly 12-15 pieces, varying in size. Average piece size is about 1.5 to 2 cm in length and moderately thick. Step 3: Tuna is a dense food, so weight per volume is quite high. The pieces are not compressed but loosely scattered. Step 4: Estimating volume occupied by tuna: given it is intermixed with couscous and cucumber, tuna probably comprises about 25%-30% of total volume in the container. Estimating total contents weight would be about 350g to 400g for the entire mixture. Tuna portion estimated around 25%-30% of that yields 90-120g. Given visual size and density, 100g is a reasonable medium portion estimate. Step 5: Cross-validating typical serving sizes of tuna in mixed salads: 100g is consistent with common Swiss portions and visual evidence here. Therefore, final estimation: 100 grams of tuna."
xjvrtk,courgette et oignons,300.0,300.0,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food item is ""courgette et oignons"" (zucchini and onions). This is located on the left side of the container. The pieces are cut into medium-sized chunks and mixed together. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The container is approximately the size of a typical lunch glass container, about 15x15 cm. The zucchini and onions fill roughly half of the container's volume. The thickness of the vegetable portion looks to be around 3-4 cm, with a moderate pile but not heaped. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cooked zucchini and onions have a moderate density, similar to cooked vegetables, usually around 0.75 to 1 g/cm3. They are somewhat water dense but softened by cooking which reduces density slightly. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Estimating the volume: half the container's area (roughly 15x15/2 = 112.5 cm2) times 3.5 cm depth gives approximately 394 cubic cm. Using density approx 0.8 g/cm3 gives a weight around 315 grams. Given that this is a moderate portion, not overflowing, a slightly reduced estimate around 300 grams seems reasonable. Step 5: Cross-validation - Visually the portion is moderate, and zucchini and onions are dense and cooked, this weight estimate aligns well with typical cooked vegetable servings in a Swiss portion context. Therefore, estimate is 300 grams for ""courgette et oignons""."
