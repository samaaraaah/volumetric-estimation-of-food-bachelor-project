ppf8hc,spaghetti,217.0,510,293.0,7.947625,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/7c7d7932-0ffe-47e1-83e9-2289044511e5,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'spaghetti'. In the image, spaghetti is served on a standard dinner plate approximately 26-28 cm in diameter, but here served on a wide, shallow black bowl roughly the size of a dessert plate (about 20 cm across). The spaghetti pile covers most of the plate's bottom and is about 2-2.5 cm thick on average. Estimating the volume: diameter ~20 cm, thickness ~2.5 cm, volume ~ (π * (10 cm)^2) * 2.5 cm ≈ 785 ml. For cooked spaghetti, density is about 0.6-0.7 g/ml due to water absorption. Using 0.65 g/ml: 785 ml * 0.65 g/ml ≈ 510 g. A conservative low estimate would be about 400 g, high estimate about 600 g to cover portion variation. This fits plausibly given the plate and visible amount. Therefore, a reasonable final estimate is 510 g."
xjvrtk,séré maigre,145.0,430,285.0,5.165625,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/6d7c5913-406a-449c-a95d-dae1cff11f27,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'séré maigre', which appears as a creamy, slightly thick mixture with visible chia seeds and hazelnut purée mixed in. It is served in a small bowl, which is approximately 12-14 cm in diameter based on the size of the spoon (typical teaspoon length about 12-14 cm visible here). The visible level of food is around 3-4 cm deep in the bowl. Estimating the volume as a cylinder: about 13 cm diameter and 3.5 cm height gives volume ≈ π * (6.5 cm)^2 * 3.5 cm ≈ 463 ml. Given the creamy density of 'séré maigre' mixed with nut purée and chia seeds, the density would be around 1.0 g/ml. This gives a weight estimate near 460-470 g. However, the bowl is not fully filled, and some empty space is visible, so a slightly conservative estimate is about 400-450 g. The plausible low-high range is 380-480 g considering some uncertainty. Therefore, a final estimate of 430 g is reasonable and physically plausible in the container size."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,135,282.0,14.69925,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is ""salade de tomates"" located on a dessert plate of approximately 20 cm diameter. The tomato slices cover most of the plate surface, with an average thickness of about 1.5 cm, as typical tomato slices are thin. The approximate dimensions for volume estimation are 15 cm (length) x 15 cm (width) x 1.5 cm (height) = 337.5 cm³. Tomato density is roughly 0.4 g/ml since they are mostly water with fibrous content. Therefore, estimated weight = 337.5 cm³ x 0.4 g/cm³ ≈ 135 g. Considering some empty spaces between slices, a low-high range of 120-150 g is plausible. The estimate 135 g fits well inside this range and corresponds to the visible volume on the plate."
wrah5h,poire,175.0,420,245.0,5.359375,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/8487ef93-2680-471e-986f-692657cd360f,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'poire' (pear), visible as several cut pieces inside a rectangular plastic container. The container size can be roughly estimated by comparing it to the visible hand and fabric background, which suggests the container is a small to medium lunchbox approximately 15 cm long and 10 cm wide. Each pear piece appears to be roughly 5-7 cm in length and around 3-4 cm in width and height, typical for medium pear slices. The total volume estimation: assume 6 sizeable pieces averaging about 6 cm × 3.5 cm × 3.5 cm = 73.5 cm³ per piece. Multiplying by 6 pieces gives roughly 440 cm³. Pear density is close to water at about 0.95 g/cm³, so estimated mass is about 418 grams. Considering some variation in size and gaps between pieces, a reasonable weight range is 350-450 grams. The final single estimate of 420 grams fits well within that range and the container size, representing a plausible weight for the pear pieces shown."
8japfq,"pizza champignons, olives, courgettes",183.0,400,217.0,4.963875,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/9ac9736b-e0d1-4862-9981-1f47f8109d18,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'pizza champignons, olives, courgettes', which corresponds to the whole plate of pizza shown in the image. The pizza is served on a large dinner plate, approximately 26-28 cm in diameter, which helps calibrate the size of the pizza slices. The visible pizza appears to be roughly 24-26 cm in diameter before slicing, typical for a medium pizza. The pizza thickness is about 1-2 cm including toppings (cheese, vegetables). Using approximate dimensions of 25 cm diameter and 1.5 cm thickness, the pizza is roughly a flat cylinder with volume π*(12.5^2)*1.5 = about 735 ml in volume. The density of pizza (bread base plus cheese, vegetables) is about 0.9 to 1.0 g/ml, close to dense solid but slightly less than water due to air in the crust. So estimated weight range is roughly 660 to 735 g for the whole pizza. However, the image shows 4 slices remaining out of what likely was 6 or 8 slices originally. Estimating the current visible portion (4 slices) as about half the pizza (if total 8 slices), then weight is about 330 to 370 g. Alternatively, if total 6 slices and 4 remain, that is 2/3 pizza, so weight is about 440 to 490 g. Given these slices cover about 2/3 of the plate surface, I estimate the current pizza weight at roughly 400 grams to be a balanced estimate. This fits the known volume, the plate size, and the visible toppings' spread. Therefore, final estimate: 400 g for 'pizza champignons, olives, courgettes'."
xjvrtk,courgette et oignons,300.0,105,195.0,7.3125,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'courgette et oignons', which is located on the left side of the glass container. The container is approximately a standard small meal prep glass container, roughly 15 cm by 15 cm, judging by the size relative to the wood-grain table. The portion of courgettes and onions occupies roughly half the container’s floor area, about 7 cm by 15 cm, and has a fill height around 2.5 cm. This gives a volume estimate of about 7 cm x 15 cm x 2.5 cm = 262.5 cm³. Courgette and onion cooked, mostly vegetable with some water content, have a typical density around 0.3 to 0.5 g/ml depending on cooking and water retained; using 0.4 g/ml is a balanced estimate. Therefore, the total weight range is roughly 105 g (262.5 x 0.4) ± 20% yielding a low-high range of 85 g to 125 g. Checking plausibility, the vegetables seem lightly cooked and not densely packed, so 105 g is reasonable and fits physically in the container space shown."
xjvrtk,tomates cerises,500.0,320,180.0,11.25,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/5ccbcf64-3631-48df-9e8a-85fb33dbf912,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'tomates cerises' (cherry tomatoes) located in a small cardboard container. The container sits on a fabric surface next to an open book. The open book's size suggests a regular paperback approximately 13-15 cm in height, which helps scale the tomatoes and container. Assuming the container is about 15 cm long and 6-7 cm wide, the tomatoes are roughly 2-3 cm diameter each. There appear to be around 20 cherry tomatoes, still attached to their vine. Average cherry tomato weight is about 15-20 grams. Given their size and number, total volume estimate is roughly 20 tomatoes × ~16 g average weight = approx. 320 g total. Density for cherry tomatoes is close to water, about 1 g/ml. The low-high plausible range is 280-360 g based on size variations and some tomatoes partially obscured. The final estimate of 320 g fits well within this range and is reasonable given the visual volume and typical density."
p96w4a,croissants au jambon,37.0,215,178.0,0.82325,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/7bd6e67d-b1ca-42e4-a5ca-713b7fadda27,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'croissants au jambon', located on the left side of the plate. They are two small croissants with visible baked texture and some ham likely inside. The croissants appear on a standard dinner plate (~26-28 cm diameter). Comparing the croissants to the knife and fork (around 20 cm length), each croissant is about 8-9 cm long and roughly 4-5 cm wide, with an estimated height of about 4 cm considering their puffed shape. The volume of one croissant is roughly estimated as a cylinder or rounded prism: length 8 cm x width 4.5 cm x height 4 cm = approx 144 ml per croissant, so two croissants about 288 ml. Croissants with ham filling have a density roughly around 0.7-0.8 g/ml due to pastry airiness and meat filling moisture. Therefore, total estimated weight range is about 0.7 x 288 = 201 g (low) to 0.8 x 288 = 230 g (high). Considering slight compression and density variation, a final estimate of around 215 g is plausible and fits the visual size. This excludes any packaging weight and is only for the visible croissants and their ham filling."

The specified food is 'légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)', located on the right side of the plate. The plate is a standard dinner plate, approximately 26–28 cm in diameter. The vegetables roughly cover an area about 10 cm by 6 cm, and the depth is estimated around 1.5 cm since they are sautéed and appear layered but not piled high. Volume = 10 cm x 6 cm x 1.5 cm = 90 ml. Considering sautéed vegetables have a typical density around 0.3–0.5 g/ml due to air gaps and softer texture, I select 0.4 g/ml for this mix. This results in a weight estimate of 90 ml x 0.4 g/ml = 36 g. A low-high range estimate considering volume uncertainty and density variance could be 30–45 g. The final estimate of 36 g fits well within this range and is plausible given the visible portion size and plate area."

The specified food is 'pain' (bread). There are two slices of bread visible on a standard dinner plate (approx. 26 cm diameter). Each slice is an artisan-style sliced loaf piece, roughly 15 cm long and 7-8 cm wide, with a thickness of about 2.5 cm. Bread density is typically around 0.3-0.4 g/ml due to air pockets. Volume per slice is approximately 15 cm x 8 cm x 2.5 cm = 300 cm³. Considering density, weight per slice is 300 cm³ x 0.35 g/cm³ = 105 g per slice. Since two slices are visible, total bread weight is about 210 g. Low-high range for one slice is 90-120 g, so for two slices 180-240 g. The estimate fits well within this, and physically matches the piece size on the plate. Final single-number estimate for one slice used here is approximately 105 g."
xjvrtk,myrtilles,200.0,360,160.0,4.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/4d153e2f-e2dc-478b-80de-472793d5b51e,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries). They are clearly located in a small bowl held by a hand. The bowl appears to be about the size of a small dessert bowl, roughly 12 cm in diameter, based on the hand width holding it (hand width approx. 8-10 cm). The blueberries fill the bowl close to the rim. Blueberries typically have a density close to water, about 1 g/ml, because they are mostly water inside with some air spaces. To estimate volume: assuming a bowl diameter of 12 cm, the surface area is about 113 cm² (πr² with r=6 cm). The depth filled with blueberries looks around 4 cm. Volume = 113 cm² * 4 cm ≈ 452 ml. Considering some air gaps between berries, let's reduce this by about 20%, giving ~360 ml actual blueberry volume. Using density ~1 g/ml, estimate mass as ~360 g. For a range, considering variation in packing and depth, between roughly 300 g and 400 g. The final estimate of 360 g fits well in this range and the bowl size, so it is plausible."
2ahgvr,colrave crue,118.0,255,137.0,2.02075,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/3718d88c-ba98-4da1-84dc-7d5ad0a4df92,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'colrave crue' (raw kohlrabi), which is present as peeled, cut pieces on a small white plastic tray. The tray size is roughly comparable to a standard takeout lid, estimated about 20 cm in length, so this serves as a reference for scale. The pieces are irregular but mostly about 4-6 cm in length and roughly 2-3 cm thick. Approximating total volume as roughly a pile of about 20 pieces averaging 5 cm x 3 cm x 1 cm each gives about 300 cm³ total volume (dimension conservative assumption due to stacking). Raw kohlrabi has a density close to water, around 0.8 to 0.9 g/ml due to its crisp texture. Using 0.85 g/ml as a central density: 300 ml x 0.85 g/ml = 255 grams approx. Considering uncertainties in piece count and thickness, a low-high range of 220-280 g is plausible. The final estimate fits well the visible portion and pile on the tray without overflow or excessive height. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'colrave crue' here is 255 grams."

The specified food is 'pain' (bread). There are three slices of bread on a standard dinner plate about 26-28 cm in diameter, which is used as a reference. Each slice is roughly 10-12 cm long and about 5-6 cm wide, and approximately 2-3 cm thick as observed from the crust height. Typical density of bread is about 0.3-0.4 g/ml due to its porous structure. Estimating volume: 3 slices × (12 cm × 6 cm × 2.5 cm) = 540 cm³ total volume. Using density 0.35 g/cm³, total weight is about 189 grams. Given some uncertainty, a reasonable weight range is 160-210 grams. Therefore, a single number estimate fitting within this range is 190 grams."

The specified food is 'fraises' (strawberries) located in a small green bowl. There is no commercial packaging visible. For reference, the bowl diameter appears to be about 12-14 cm based on typical small bowls, and the strawberries fit inside it with some spacing. The strawberries themselves average about 5-7 cm in length, which is consistent with large strawberries. Typical strawberry density is close to water, about 0.6–0.7 g/ml, as strawberries are mostly water but with some air cavities. There are three strawberries visible, somewhat irregular in shape but one is especially large. Assuming average strawberry weight ranges from 15 to 25 grams depending on size, these three appear quite large. A conservative estimate is about 20 grams for the largest and about 15 grams each for the other two. This means a total of roughly 50 grams for all three. A low-high range could be 40-60 grams considering size variability. 50 grams is plausible for the volume they occupy in the bowl and texture. Therefore, the estimate for the total weight of the 'fraises' is 50 grams."

The specified food is 'légumes (courgette, oignon, 1 cs d'huile d'olive)'. These cooked vegetables are located on the left side of a standard dinner plate, which appears to be around 26 cm in diameter. The portion occupies roughly one third of the plate surface. Visually estimating, the vegetables cover approximately 13 cm by 9 cm area, with an average fill depth of about 1.5-2 cm since they are sautéed and spread flat. This produces a volume around 13 cm * 9 cm * 1.7 cm = roughly 200 ml. The cooked vegetables (courgette and onion) with some olive oil have a density about 0.4 to 0.6 g/ml because vegetables contain water and are cooked but not dense solids. Using a conservative medium value of 0.5 g/ml, the weight estimate range is 80 g (0.4*200) to 120 g (0.6*200). The portion looks realistic and could fit the estimated volume. Thus, a final estimate of 100 g is plausible and balanced inside the range."

The specified food is 'pâtes' (pasta), located at the bottom of the plate, underneath the dollop of mozzarella. The plate is a standard dinner plate, approximately 26-28 cm in diameter, confirmed by the visible fork to the left (~20 cm length). The pasta portion covers roughly a quarter of the plate's surface, approximately a 12 cm by 9 cm area. The pasta is spiral-shaped, cooked and lightly piled, with an estimated height of about 2 cm. Volume estimate: 12 cm x 9 cm x 2 cm = 216 ml. Cooked pasta density is roughly 0.8-1.0 g/ml. Using 0.9 g/ml as a reasonable average density for cooked pasta gives an estimated weight range of about 170 to 220 grams. A low-high plausible weight range is 170-220 g. Final estimate should be conservative but realistic, so I estimate the pasta portion at about 200 grams. This fits well on the plate and within typical portion sizes."

The specified food is 'carotte' (carrot), which is located on the left side of a standard dinner plate (approximate diameter 26-28 cm). The carrot pieces are sliced and arranged flat on the plate, so the dimensions are mainly length and width from the top view, with a visible thickness of about 1.5-2 cm. Each slice is roughly 3-4 cm in diameter. There are around 13 carrot slices visible, with an average thickness of about 1.5 cm. Estimating volume: approximate area per slice is a circle of radius 1.5 cm, area ~7 cm². Volume per slice ~7 cm² × 1.5 cm = 10.5 cm³. For 13 slices, total volume = 13 × 10.5 = 136.5 cm³. Density for cooked carrot is about 0.75-0.85 g/ml; using 0.8 g/ml for this estimate. Weight = volume × density = 136.5 × 0.8 = 109 grams approximately. Low-high range considering slice size and density variance: 90–130 grams is reasonable. The final estimate of 110 g fits well in that range and is plausible given the plate size and carrot piece size."

The specified food is ""oeufs"" (eggs). In the image, there appear to be two fried eggs placed on a plate of mixed pasta. The eggs are spread flat on top of the pasta, and each egg typically covers roughly 10 cm in diameter, which is consistent with the size of a standard fried egg. The plate is a rectangular dinner plate approximately 26-28 cm wide, which helps calibrate the estimated surface area. The eggs are not in any commercial package. The thickness of the cooked egg white with yolk is about 0.5 to 1 cm due to spreading during frying. The volume of each egg is roughly a flat cylinder: about 10 cm diameter and ~1 cm thickness equals approximately 78 ml (using volume = π*r^2*h; r=5 cm, h=1 cm). Since eggs are dense solids, the density is approximately 1.03 g/ml. Therefore, each egg weighs approximately 80 grams. There are two eggs, so total is about 160 grams. Allowing for some variation due to cooking (thinning or partial loss of volume), a low-high range would be 140 g to 180 g total. The final estimate is 160 g, which fits the size and physical plausible mass of two medium to large cooked eggs on the plate."

The specified food item is 'salade de carotte, mais, tomates'. It is located at the top center of the plate, appearing as a mixed salad containing shredded carrots, corn kernels, and cherry tomato pieces with some greens. The plate is a standard dinner plate, approximately 26-28 cm in diameter. The salad occupies about one-sixth of the plate surface area, roughly a 10 cm diameter area. The salad's height/thickness appears to be about 2 cm, a reasonable depth for a mixed salad on a flat plate. Volume estimate: assuming approximately a circular area with a diameter of 10 cm (radius 5 cm), area = π*5^2 = 78.5 cm². Volume ~ area * height = 78.5 cm² * 2 cm = 157 ml. Density for raw vegetables and salad items ranges 0.2–0.5 g/ml. Given this salad includes shredded carrots, corn, cherry tomatoes and some greens with some creamy dressing, a density around 0.5 g/ml is plausible. Weight range: 157 ml * 0.2 g/ml = ~31 g (low) to 157 ml * 0.5 g/ml = ~79 g (high). Taking into account the visible volume and mixture density, a mid-point estimate around 65 g is reasonable as the salad looks quite dense with dressing and corn. This fits well with the plate and food portion. Therefore, the best estimate for 'salade de carotte, mais, tomates' is 65 grams."

Considering the area covered by the chips, roughly 18 cm diameter circle of coverage (about 254 cm²), and a thickness of approximately 1.5 cm, the total volume is around 381 cm³ (254 cm² * 1.5 cm). Chips made from beans are typically light and porous, with a density roughly around 0.3–0.4 g/ml (due to air and puffed structure). Using an average density of 0.35 g/ml, the estimated weight is 381 ml * 0.35 g/ml = about 133 grams. A plausible low-high range would be 110–150 grams to account for stacking density variations and air gaps. The final estimate of 130 grams fits well within this range and looks physically reasonable given the amount of chips and the plate size."

The blueberries are interspersed in the cereal and yogurt mixture. Blueberries are roughly spherical with about 1.5 to 2 cm diameter each. There are about 15-20 visible blueberries, some partially hidden. Estimating about 20 blueberries total, with an average weight of 1.5 g per blueberry, that gives approximately 30 g. Considering some are likely hidden or embedded, the range can be 25-35 g. This fits well visually as the blueberries are scattered but not densely packed. Hence, final estimate 30 g. Density or volume estimate is less relevant here since counting discrete items is more precise."

Using the apple size as reference, we estimate the apple volume as roughly spherical with diameter about 7-8 cm. The volume estimation is close to a sphere: V = 4/3 * pi * r^3, with r=3.5-4 cm, resulting in about 180-270 ml. Given that raw apples have a density approximately 0.6-0.7 g/ml, the weight range can be estimated as 110-190 grams. Considering the apple not being perfectly spherical and shown in the image, a conservative weight estimate would be near the middle of the range. A plausible weight estimate for this apple is 150 grams. This fits well within the realistic size and density expectations for an apple of this apparent dimension."

The specified food is 'pâtes' (pasta). In the image, the pasta is a portion of twisted fusilli looking noodles partially covered with grated parmesan on the right side of the tray. The tray is a stainless steel lunch box, roughly the size of a standard dinner plate width (about 26 cm wide). The pasta covers approximately half the length and about half the width of the tray bottom. Estimating the area it occupies as roughly 13 cm by 12 cm. The pasta layer visible is about 1.5-2 cm thick due to typical cooked pasta layering. Volume estimate = 13 cm x 12 cm x 1.5 cm = 234 ml (conservatively rounded). Cooked pasta density is around 0.8-1.0 g/ml depending on moisture; we'll use 0.9 g/ml as a reasonable average. This gives a weight range low-high = about 187 g to 234 g. The portion size looks consistent with a typical meal serving but not overly large. Final plausibility check: the pasta fills roughly half of the container's base and is about 1.5 cm thick, so around 210 g is a plausible estimate."

The specified food is 'oeufs brouillés' (scrambled eggs), located on the left side of the plate. The plate used appears to be a standard dinner plate, approximately 26-28 cm in diameter, which provides a good scale reference. The scrambled eggs occupy roughly the top left quarter of the plate, with an estimated visible area of about 10 cm by 7 cm. Scrambled eggs on a plate tend to be roughly 1-2 cm thick, so we estimate a volume around 10 cm x 7 cm x 1.5 cm = 105 ml. The density of scrambled eggs is about 0.85 g/ml due to the cooked composition. Multiplying volume by density gives an estimate of around 105 ml * 0.85 g/ml = 89 grams. For a plausible range, considering the estimating thickness could be from 1 to 2 cm, the low-high weight range could be 60 g to 120 g. The final estimate of 90 g fits well within this range and matches the visible portion on the plate. The eggs are loosely heaped and not packed tightly so this volume and density estimate is reasonable. Thus, 90 grams is a consistent and plausible estimate for the scrambled eggs on this plate."

The specified food is 'pain bis' (brown bread). In the image, this corresponds to two slices of brown bread typical for a sandwich. The bread slices are held in a human hand, giving a scale reference; an adult hand width is about 8-10 cm. Each slice is roughly 12 cm long and 7 cm wide, and the thickness is about 1.5 cm. The volume of one slice can be estimated as 12 x 7 x 1.5 = 126 cm³. Bread density is approximately 0.3-0.4 g/cm³ for brown bread due to its porous structure. So, the weight per slice is roughly 126 x 0.35 = about 44 grams. Since we have two slices visible, total weight is about 88 grams. Low-high range: 70-100 grams is plausible due to slight variability in bread density and slice thickness. The estimate sits well within this range and corresponds physically to the size observed. Container weight is not applicable here."

The specified food, tarte aux fraises, is identified as the slice of strawberry tart on a standard dessert plate (≈20 cm diameter). Comparing the tart slice size relative to the plate, it occupies about one-sixth to one-eighth of the plate's area. The tart slice is approximately 10 cm long and 5 cm wide, with a visible depth of about 2.5 cm. This yields an estimated volume around 125 cubic centimeters (10 x 5 x 2.5). The tart consists of a dense crust, cream filling, and strawberries. Estimating an average density for the tart at around 0.9 g/ml due to crust and creamy elements balancing with fruit lightness is reasonable. 125 ml volume x 0.9 g/ml density gives about 113 grams. A plausible low-high range with slight variance in density and volume is 100 to 130 grams. The final estimate of 113 grams is well within this range and physically consistent with the visible tart slice size on the plate."

The specified food item is ""muesli nature"". In the image, the muesli is served in a small orange bowl. The bowl is about the diameter of a dessert plate (20 cm) or a bit smaller, but the bowl itself looks around 10 cm wide based on comparison with the adjacent square white bowl containing yogurt. The muesli fills the bowl roughly to a height of about 3 to 4 cm, considering the clusters' size and typical bowl depth. The volume can be approximated as a cylinder or bowl shape: roughly 10 cm diameter and 3.5 cm height gives a volume of about 270 mL (using V = πr²h; r=5cm, h=3.5cm, volume ≈ 3.14*25*3.5 = 275 ml). Muesli is primarily dry oats and clusters, with a typical density around 0.3 to 0.5 g/ml since it is quite airy and not densely packed. Using an average density of approximately 0.4 g/ml, the estimated weight = 275 ml * 0.4 g/ml = 110 g. Lower bound considering looser packing could be about 80 g, upper bound about 130 g. This fits the visible volume and typical cluster size. Final estimate: 110 g for the ""muesli nature"" portion shown."

The specified food is ""beurre"" (butter), which is spread thinly under the strawberry jam on four slices of bread. The bread slices are on a standard dinner plate approximately 26-28 cm in diameter, providing scale. Each slice of bread is about 10-12 cm long and 5-6 cm wide. The butter layer is quite thin, roughly about 2-3 mm thick in most areas, as it is just spread for flavor, not a thick pat. To estimate volume, I multiply the approximate surface area per slice (about 55 cm² average) by the thickness (0.25 cm), giving roughly 13.75 ml per slice of butter. Four slices yield about 55 ml total volume. Butter’s density is about 0.9 g/ml. Multiplying volume by density: 55 ml x 0.9 g/ml = 49.5 g. Considering some uneven spread and gaps, a reasonable range is 40-55 grams. The estimate fits typical serving sizes of butter spread thinly on multiple slices of bread. Therefore, a good single estimate is 50 grams."

The specified food is 'toast'. In the image, there are two slices of toasted bread on a standard dinner plate, which is about 26-28 cm in diameter. Each toast slice is roughly square and about one quarter to one fifth of the plate size, estimating around 9 cm by 9 cm per slice. The thickness of the toast appears about 1.5 to 2 cm. Volume per slice can be estimated as 9 cm x 9 cm x 1.8 cm = approximately 146 ml. Bread density is about 0.3 to 0.4 g/ml (light and airy). Using 0.35 g/ml, the mass of one slice of toast is approximately 146 x 0.35 = 51 grams. There are two slices visible, but the task is for a single specified item (toast), so we estimate the combined weight or per slice as needed. Since the food name is 'toast' in singular but visually two slices exist, we consider the total toast portion. Two slices therefore weigh about 102 grams total. However, if the specification was for one slice, it would be about 50 grams. The plausible range per slice is 45-55 grams; total range for both slices is 90 to 110 grams. Since the user asked for toast in general and there are two slices, the best estimate is the combined weight of the toast seen. The 'fromage frais' is a spread on the toast, but as it is not asked for, we exclude it. Final plausibility check: the toast slices fit the plate, and weights align with standard bread slice weights."

The specified food item is a 'pomme' (apple). In the image, the apple is placed on a flat surface with no commercial packaging. The size can be approximated by comparing it to the shadow and typical scale: this apple looks small to medium-sized, about 6-7 cm in diameter, which fits with the visual impression of a small apple. Typical apples of this size weigh between 120 and 160 grams. Given the slightly smaller size of this apple in the image, a conservative estimate towards the lower middle of that range is reasonable. Volume roughly corresponds to a sphere of 6.5 cm diameter = ~143 cm³, and apple density is close to 1 g/ml, so weight estimate aligns with volume. The plausible weight range is 110-160 grams. Final estimate: 140 grams."

The sauce bolognese is visibly spread on the top of a plate of spaghetti. The plate is a standard dinner plate, approximately 26-28 cm in diameter. The sauce covers roughly a central area about 15 cm long and 8 cm wide, with an estimated thickness of about 1.5 cm based on its spread and relative volume. This gives a volume approximation of 15 cm x 8 cm x 1.5 cm = 180 ml. Considering the density of a thick sauce like bolognese, approximately 1.0 g/ml, the estimated weight range is about 150-210 grams. The final conservative estimate is 180 grams, which fits the observed quantity on the plate without overflowing or appearing sparse."

The plate is a square dinner plate approximately 26 cm wide, the raviolis cover roughly a quarter of the plate’s surface, around 13 cm by 13 cm area. The raviolis are around 1 cm thick, typical for stuffed pasta. Volume estimate: 13 cm x 13 cm x 1 cm = 169 ml. Given pasta with filling density is about 1.1 g/ml, estimated weight = 169 x 1.1 = ~186 g. A low-high plausible range considering some raviolis overlap and air gaps could be 150-210 g. The estimated weight 186 g fits well in this range and matches a normal portion size. There are about 7 half-visible raviolis, again consistent with this total mass. No commercial packaging is present, so weight is based on visual portion estimation."

The estimated volume is length x width x height = 10 cm x 6 cm x 1.5 cm = 90 ml. The density of a pasta salad, combining cooked pasta and small vegetable pieces, is roughly 0.8 g/ml due to some air gaps and dressing. Multiplying volume by density gives 90 ml x 0.8 g/ml = 72 grams. Considering some margin for uneven distribution and partial coverage, a realistic low-high range is 60-80 grams. This final estimate of 72 grams fits plausibly within that range and the size observed on the plate. The food is not packaged and can be directly estimated by volume and density."

The specified food is 'pain', which is a single slice of bread visible on a black plate. For reference, the plate appears to be a dessert size plate (around 20 cm diameter). The slice of bread covers roughly half the diameter of the plate and has an average thickness for a typical slice of whole grain bread, around 2-3 cm thick. Bread typically has a density of about 0.3-0.4 g/ml (light and airy structure). The slice measures approximately 12 cm by 10 cm by 2 cm, giving a volume estimate of 240 ml. Multiplying by bread density (0.35 g/ml) results in a weight estimate of about 84 g. A low-high weight range for a slice of this size is roughly 70-100 g. My estimate of 85 g fits well into this range, representing realistic thickness and size of the slice shown. This excludes crust differences and is based purely on visible size and common bread density."

Bread density typically ranges around 0.25-0.35 g/ml due to its porous nature. Volume estimate: length 10 cm × width 10 cm × thickness 2.5 cm = 250 cm³. Using density 0.3 g/ml, the mass estimate is 250 × 0.3 = 75 g. A reasonable low-high range would be 60-90 g, depending on bread type and compactness. The slice size and density make the estimate plausible, fitting well on the plate and consistent with normal bread slice weights."

Estimating volume: 13 cm (length) x 6.5 cm (width) x 2 cm (height) = approximately 169 cm³. Bread density is around 0.3-0.4 g/ml due to air pockets. Using a middle density of 0.35 g/ml, weight = 169 ml x 0.35 g/ml ≈ 59 grams. Given slight compression and irregularities, the range is roughly 50-65 grams for this slice. Since there are two slices on the plate, but only one piece is requested, estimate per slice is about 60 grams, which fits well within the low-high range."

The carrots are visible in several pieces dispersed mainly among the eggplant and pasta. The total visible carrot area covers roughly a 7 cm by 2 cm footprint with a thickness of about 0.3 cm (thin slices). This gives an estimated volume of 7 cm x 2 cm x 0.3 cm = 4.2 cm³. Carrots, being raw vegetables, have a density close to 0.4 to 0.6 g/ml; we use 0.5 g/ml as a fair average. Multiplying volume by density gives 4.2 cm³ x 0.5 g/cm³ = 2.1 g. However, considering slices may overlap and some carrot pieces may be slightly hidden or skewed in thickness, a reasonable low-high estimate is 2 g to 5 g.

The salad portion covers roughly a 10 cm by 7 cm area with an estimated height of about 2 cm. Thus, the volume estimate is 10 cm x 7 cm x 2 cm = 140 ml. The density of raw vegetables such as lettuce is roughly 0.2 - 0.5 g/ml; considering the lettuce leaves are somewhat packed and dressed, a median density of 0.4 g/ml is appropriate. Multiplying volume and density gives 140 ml x 0.4 g/ml = 56 grams as the estimated weight. A low-high plausible range would be around 40-70 grams.

The piece of meat occupies roughly one quarter of the plate's radius in length, estimated around 10 cm long, about 5 cm wide, and roughly 1.5 cm thick (assuming a ground meat patty). Volume approximation: 10 cm × 5 cm × 1.5 cm = 75 ml. Given that cooked ground meat has a density close to 1 g/ml, this leads to an estimated weight of about 75 g. Considering possible variations in thickness and porosity, a reasonable low-high range is 65–85 g. The meat is not in a package, so no commercial pack weights apply. The final estimate of 75 g is plausible and consistent with the visible size and typical meat density."

The thickness of the pizza slice is about 1.5 cm, including crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings. Estimating volume: approximately 8 cm x 8 cm x 1.5 cm = 96 ml. For pizza with bread dough, sauce, cheese, and mushrooms, a density around 0.9 g/ml is reasonable due to the mixture of solid and moist components. This results in a weight estimate of 96 ml x 0.9 g/ml = 86 g. A low-high plausible range would be 75-100 g considering possible variations in thickness and toppings.

The poivron portion covers roughly a 10 cm by 4 cm area with a height of about 1 cm, given the thin sliced strips. This leads to an approximate volume of 10 cm x 4 cm x 1 cm = 40 ml. Bell peppers have a density roughly between 0.3 and 0.5 g/ml because they are crunchy vegetables with some water content. Using 0.4 g/ml as a moderate density gives an estimated weight of 40 ml x 0.4 g/ml = 16 grams. A plausible low-high range would be 12 g (if slices are thin and sparse) to 20 g (if denser slices).

The specified food item 'branche de chocolat' is visible in the image as a single chocolate stick/bar placed on a wooden surface. It is not in any commercial packaging now, so we cannot rely on standard commercial package weights but must estimate based on its physical dimensions and typical density. Using the wooden table surface grain and the common understanding of chocolate bar sizes, the chocolate branch looks approximately 10-12 cm long and about 2-2.5 cm in diameter. Thickness and length correspond roughly to a small chocolate snack stick. Reference objects like typical hand width (about 8-10 cm) or a standard pen size allow us to gauge the scale. Volume estimation: Treating it as a cylinder approximately 11 cm long and 2.3 cm diameter: volume ≈ π × (1.15 cm)^2 × 11 cm ≈ 45.8 cm³. Density of chocolate is roughly 1.2 g/cm³ (denser than water). Weight estimate: 45.8 cm³ × 1.2 g/cm³ ≈ 55 g. Considering possible air pockets on the surface (the bumpy texture), the actual volume might be slightly less, so a realistic weight range low-high is about 50-60 g. This matches typical weight for similar chocolate snack bars outdoors of packaging. Final estimate chosen as 55 g is central to this range, making it plausible and consistent with the observed size and density."

I assume the container is about the size of a small meal prep box, roughly 18 cm long and 12 cm wide. The tomato portion fills about one third of the container's base area and roughly 1 cm thick. Given this, the volume is approximately 18 cm x 4 cm (one third width) x 1 cm height = 72 ml. The density of raw tomato is around 0.3–0.4 g/ml due to high water content and internal air spaces. Using 0.35 g/ml as a midpoint, mass is about 72 ml x 0.35 g/ml = 25 g. A low-high range would be about 20 g to 30 g. The estimate of 25 g fits this range and looks plausible for the sliced tomato quantity in the container."

Assuming the container is similar in size to a typical lunchbox tray compartment, roughly 20-22 cm long, this helps calibrate scale. Each piece looks approximately 15-18 cm long and about 8-10 cm wide, matching a typical store-bought flatbread or wrap size. The flatbread is thin, likely around 2-3 mm thickness when folded. The density of such flatbread is generally around 0.9-1.1 g/ml (somewhat close to water but slightly denser due to flour content). Estimating volume: length ~16 cm, width ~9 cm, thickness ~0.3 cm; volume = 16 * 9 * 0.3 = 43.2 cm³ or ml. Weight range using densities (0.9 to 1.1) is approximately 39 to 47 g per flatbread section. Since there are two pieces, but one is partially eaten, I estimate the total flatbread equates roughly to 1.5 full wraps, so total weight falls around 60 to 70 g. This fits typical single wrap weights (45-65 g). Final single-number estimate, balanced in the plausible range, is 65 g."
ppf8hc,poulet,98.0,120,22.0,0.2695,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/9c8fc2f7-062d-4701-885c-184a8d501c5b,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'poulet' (chicken). The piece of chicken is placed on a standard black dinner plate, which I estimate to be about 26-28 cm in diameter based on typical dinnerware size. Using the plate as a reference, the chicken portion is roughly 10 cm long, 6 cm wide, and about 2 cm high (a flatter cut, possibly breast meat with some juices around it). To estimate volume, multiply these dimensions: 10 cm x 6 cm x 2 cm = 120 cm³. Chicken breast density is approximately 1 g/cm³ since it is dense lean meat. Therefore, the weight estimate is about 120 grams. Considering some margin for the shape and possible thinner areas, a reasonable low-high range would be 110-130 grams. The final estimate of 120 grams fits well in this range and seems plausible for the visible portion on the plate."
2ahgvr,graines de chia,8.0,30,22.0,0.022,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/aa859e5b-563f-472c-9914-036722ebf60e,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is graines de chia. In the image, the graines de chia appear as small black seeds mixed throughout a creamy white mixture in a white bowl. The bowl is a standard medium-sized bowl, approximately 15 cm in diameter, commonly used for individual servings. The entire mixture seems to be a blend of blanc battu, flocons d'avoine, graines de chia, and miel. The visible graines de chia are dispersed within this mixture and not in a separate container or layer, so their volume is only a fraction of the total bowl content. Using a reference of the bowl size (~15 cm diameter, ~7 cm deep max) and the visible density and distribution, the total mixture volume is roughly 400-450 ml. Graines de chia are dense seeds with about 1.1 g/ml density, but they only make up an estimated 5–10% of the mixture volume by visible seed density (scattered and sparse throughout). This indicates the graines de chia volume is about 20-40 ml, corresponding roughly to 20-40 grams. A reasonable range is 20–40 grams. Considering the moderate visible seed content without heavy clumps, a final estimate for graines de chia weight is about 30 grams. This fits plausibly within the total mixture and the seed presence, excluding container weight and focusing solely on the seeds."

The specified food is 'mélasse,' which is visible spread on one slice of bread on the top. The plate is a standard dinner plate about 26 cm in diameter, which helps calibrate the size of the bread slice roughly 12-14 cm long and about 8-9 cm wide. The mélasse spread is fairly thin, covering most of the surface of the slice but not very thick, perhaps around 2 mm thick. Considering the area of about 100 cm² and a thin layer 0.2 cm thick, volume is approximately 20 cm³ or ml. Molasses density is close to a thick syrup, roughly 1.4 g/ml. So estimated weight = 20 ml × 1.4 g/ml = 28 g. A low-high range considering spread thinness might be 20-35 g, with 28 g well within that range. This matches the visible spread thickness and surface area on the slice without overestimating. No commercial packaging involved here to consider."

The specified food is a 'barre de chocolat kinder,' which is visually confirmed as a small chocolate bar similar to a Kinder Bueno or Kinder Schoko-Bons bar segment. It is not in a commercial package visible here, but typical individual Kinder chocolate bars are known standard sizes. For example, a Kinder Bueno single bar weighs approximately 43 grams. The reference object used here is the wooden surface with visible grain and measurements inferred by standard wood plank widths (~7-10 cm wide), and the chocolate bar length is about 10 cm, confirming it is a single standard bar piece. The volume of the bar can be roughly estimated as a cuboid: about 10 cm long, 2 cm wide, and 1.5 cm thick. This gives a volume around 30 cubic cm. Chocolate density is approximately 1.3 g/ml, so 30 cm³ × 1.3 g/cm³ = 39 grams approximately. Low-high weight range would be around 35-45 grams, which fits well-known commercial Kinder bar weights. Thus, the estimate is 43 grams, consistent with the known product size and visual scale."
xjvrtk,galette millet maïs haricots noirs,80.0,60,20.0,0.2,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/54ee4857-524c-436a-a31b-a1013669f8c1,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. First, the specified food is 'galette millet maïs haricots noirs,' which are the two small, round patties visible in the container. Reference objects include the rectangular plastic container, which is about 15-18 cm wide internally, and the size of the patties relative to it. Each galette is roughly circular with about 5 cm diameter and a thickness of approximately 1.5 cm. Volume for one galette is estimated as π × (2.5 cm)² × 1.5 cm ≈ 29.45 ml. Both patties together have volume roughly 59 ml. The galettes are made mostly of millet, corn, and black beans, which are dense solids, so density is close to 1 g/ml or slightly less, given the porous nature—using about 0.9 g/ml to be conservative. Estimated total weight range: 50 g (lower bound) to 65 g (upper bound). Final plausibility check: the patties visually fit well in the container and match a realistic serving size. Thus, the best estimate is 60 grams."

The specified food is 'salade'. It is placed on a standard dinner plate approximately 26-28 cm in diameter. The salad occupies about one-third of the plate's surface, roughly 9 cm by 15 cm in area, with an estimated average leaf height of about 1.5 cm since it is loose leafy salad with some seeds scattered on top. The volume estimate is therefore approximately 9 cm x 15 cm x 1.5 cm = 202.5 cm³. Considering the density of raw leafy salad typically ranges between 0.2 to 0.3 g/ml, I use 0.25 g/ml as a middle ground estimate. Multiplying volume by density gives a mass estimate of about 50 grams (202.5 x 0.25 = ~50.6 g). A plausible range would be 40 g to 60 g for the salad portion visible here. Therefore, 50 grams is a reasonable, physically fitting estimate of the salad's weight on this plate."

The specified food item is 'épautre cuit' (cooked spelt), located on the left side of the glass container. The container is square and roughly the size of a standard lunchbox, about 15 cm by 15 cm approximately. Compared to the size of the cooked aubergine and scrambled eggs beside it, the portion of cooked spelt fills about one third of the container’s base area, with a fill height estimated around 2.5 cm, consistent with cooked grains. Volume estimate is roughly 15 cm x 5 cm x 2.5 cm = 187.5 ml. Density of cooked grains like spelt is about 1 g/ml since they are fairly dense. This suggests a weight range from about 170 g (conservative lower estimate) to 200 g (upper estimate). My final plausibility check confirms the spelt would physically fit in that volume, and 180 g is a reasonable estimate within the range."

The specified food item is 'barre de chocolat kinder,' and it is clearly visible in the image as a single Kinder chocolate bar resting on a wooden surface. The bar is not packaged in the image, but Kinder bars are commonly known to have standard single-serving weights. A typical Kinder chocolate bar (for example, Kinder Bueno or Kinder Chocolate bar) weighs approximately 41.5 grams, which is a standard Swiss single-serve size. For scale, the wooden surface's slats are roughly in the range of 3-4 cm width, and the bar appears to be about 12-14 cm long and 2-3 cm wide, consistent with the known dimensions of a Kinder chocolate bar. Volume estimation using the approximate dimensions (length ~13 cm, width ~2.5 cm, and height ~1 cm) yields approximately 32.5 ml; given chocolate density close to 1.1 g/ml, the calculated volume-based weight would be around 35-40 grams. Considering the known packaging weight and slight measurement uncertainties, a reasonable low-high range would be 35-45 grams. The final estimate of 41 grams fits well within this range and matches common knowledge of a standard Kinder chocolate bar weight."

The specified food item is 'maréchal,' which appears as small cubes of cheese on the plate. The plate is a standard dinner plate, about 26-28 cm diameter, providing a good size reference. The maréchal cubes are roughly 2 cm per side, and there are about 4 visible cubes. Assuming a density similar to firm cheese, approximately 1.1 g/ml, the volume per cube is about 2 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm = 8 ml. For 4 cubes, the total volume is approximately 32 ml. Multiplying by the density gives an estimated weight of about 35 grams. A low-high range might be 30-40 grams, considering possible slight differences in size and density. The 35 g estimate fits well within this range and is plausible given the visible amount and plate size."
6fwmw2,blevita,19.0,38,19.0,0.045125,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/6fwmw2/dish_media/9d7b61b8-02b0-4d63-838a-54edfe54552b,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'blevita', which are rectangular crackers. In the image, there are four stacked blevita crackers visible on a wooden surface. To estimate size, I use the texture and visible wood grain as indirect scale, but more importantly, blevita crackers are typically about 8 cm by 5 cm each, and are relatively thin, roughly around 0.3 cm thick. The stack of four would thus be approximately 1.2 cm thick. The volume of one cracker = length x width x height = 8 cm x 5 cm x 0.3 cm = 12 cm³, so four crackers total about 48 cm³. Crackers are dry, crunchy items with a density around 0.8 g/ml, slightly less than water due to air pockets. Therefore, estimated mass = volume x density = 48 cm³ x 0.8 g/cm³ = 38.4 g. A realistic range would be 30–45 g, considering possible thickness variation and density. The estimate fits the physical presence of four crackers stacked as shown, and the weight aligns well with known weights for similar whole-grain crispbreads. Final estimate is 38 g."

The specified food is mayonnaise, which is on the left side of the plate in a dollop form. This plate appears to be a standard dinner plate (approximately 26-28 cm diameter). Comparing the mayonnaise to the fork (around 20 cm long) and the plate size, the mayonnaise dollop has an approximate length of 6 cm, width of 4 cm, and a height of about 2 cm given its mound shape. Volume estimate is roughly 6 x 4 x 2 = 48 ml. Mayonnaise density is dense, close to 0.9-1 g/ml, so using 0.95 g/ml as a median density estimate. Weight range low-high would be 40-55 grams based on variation in volume and density. The 48 ml volume and chosen density yield an estimated weight of about 46 grams, which fits well in the dollop shape and physical size on the plate without spilling. Therefore, the best estimate for mayonnaise weight on this plate is 46 grams."

The plate appears to be a small dessert plate approximately 20 cm in diameter and the two pieces of tiramisu and forêt noir together occupy roughly a quarter of the plate. The tiramisu piece is around 9 cm long, 4 cm wide, and about 3 cm high. Estimating volume as a rectangular prism gives approximately 108 cm³. The density of tiramisu is similar to a thick cream dessert, around 0.8–0.9 g/ml. Using a density of 0.85 g/ml, the weight estimate range is approximately 86–97 grams. Considering some parts are slightly porous cake and cream and possible moisture loss, 90 grams is a reasonable single estimate. This fits physically on the plate and seems plausible given typical tiramisu serving sizes."

The specified food to estimate is 'gaufre'. The waffle is clearly visible on a standard-sized dessert plate, which is about 20 cm in diameter. The waffle's dimensions appear roughly 12 cm by 9 cm, with a thickness of approximately 1.5 cm, considering it is a single cooked piece. Volume estimate = 12 cm x 9 cm x 1.5 cm = 162 cm³. Typical density for cooked waffles is close to that of dense bread-like products, approximately 0.3–0.5 g/cm³ (because waffles are airy and porous). Using an average density of 0.4 g/cm³, the weight = 162 x 0.4 = 64.8 g. Low-high range considering density variation: 0.3 g/cm³ → ~49 g, 0.5 g/cm³ → ~81 g. The final estimate of about 65 g fits plausibly within this range and matches expected portion size for a single waffle piece."

The specified food item is 'salade de pâtes'. It is located visually on the lower left section of the plate, consisting of short spiral pasta mixed with small vegetable pieces. The plate is a standard dinner plate of approximately 26-28 cm in diameter, which provides a size reference. The salad portion covers roughly a 7 cm by 5 cm area with a height estimated around 2 cm since it is loosely piled. This results in an approximate volume of 7 cm * 5 cm * 2 cm = 70 ml. The salad is pasta and some vegetables, with a typical density for mixed pasta salad around 0.8 g/ml (slightly less dense than pure pasta due to vegetables). Thus, estimated weight is 70 ml * 0.8 g/ml = 56 g. Conservative low-high range would be 50-65 g to allow for slight depth or compaction variations. The estimated 56 g fits well within this range and is plausible for the portion shown."

The specified food is 'pain' (bread). It is located on a decorative ~26 cm dinner plate, giving a good size reference. The bread piece appears to be about 10 cm long, 5 cm wide, and about 2 cm thick. Bread density is typically around 0.3 to 0.4 g/ml due to its spongy nature. Volume estimate is 10 x 5 x 2 = 100 cm³ (or ml). Using the density range, weight is roughly 30 to 40 g. Considering crust weight and the realistic size of this piece, a rounded estimate near the middle of the range is plausible. The weight fits the visible piece that could physically rest on the plate without excess thickness or area."
p96w4a,demi croissant,14.0,30,16.0,0.028,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/a7d36c03-057f-474b-9b76-5296d4f9faef,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'demi croissant'. Visually, the croissant half is on a standard dinner plate (about 26–28 cm diameter), so the croissant half can be estimated by scale. A full croissant typically weighs between 55 and 65 grams, implying a half croissant should weigh about 28 to 33 grams. The piece visible here is a half croissant, without packaging, and appears typical in thickness and size compared to the plate, without large missing portions except some crumbs. Thus, the volume and density assumptions correspond to a flaky baked pastry, with a typical density ~0.2–0.3 g/ml. Given the standard portion size, the half croissant in this image should plausibly be around 30 grams."

The specified food item is 'sauce vinaigrette' visible as a light drizzle over the salad ingredients in a shallow metal container. Reference objects include the metal container (approximate size around 18 cm by 12 cm), and the standard fork next to it (around 20 cm long) which helps gauge portion size. The vinaigrette is a thin liquid, likely watery with density close to 1 g/ml. The volume of vinaigrette visible on top and partially absorbed in visible salad is limited, a thin layer mostly covering the surface between components, roughly estimated at about 10-15 ml in total. Considering occasional deeper pooling within the salad, a range between 8 g and 18 g is plausible. The final estimate is 12 g to remain conservative but realistic for the vinaigrette amount. This is consistent with typical salad dressing usage in a similar portion size container."

The specified food item is 'graine de chia' (chia seeds). Locating the chia seeds in the image, they appear as the small dark specks distributed throughout the mixture inside the glass jar. The jar itself is a small to medium glass container likely around 8-9 cm in height and approximately 7 cm in diameter, which fits comfortably in a human hand. Using the jar as reference (assuming roughly a 7 cm diameter and 8 cm height with visible fill approximately 7 cm high), the total volume of the mixture inside is about π*(3.5 cm)^2*7 cm ≈ 270 ml. The chia seeds are mixed throughout, but their density is quite high for seeds, approximately 0.7 g/ml when dry, but here they are hydrated in the mixture. The visible proportion of chia seeds relative to the rest (oats, yogurt, etc.) appears to be about 10% by volume. Thus, chia seeds volume ~27 ml, and given partial hydration and spread, density can be approximated as ~0.8 g/ml. This gives about 27 ml * 0.8 g/ml ≈ 22 grams of chia seeds. A reasonable low-high range is 15-25 grams considering distribution and hydration state. The estimate is plausible given the size of the jar and visible presence of seeds mixed throughout but not overly concentrated. Therefore, a best estimate is 22 grams for the chia seeds."

The specified food is 'tartine mélasse + beurre', which is the bottom slice of bread on the white dessert plate (approx. 20 cm diameter). The slice of bread looks about 12 cm long and about 5 cm wide. The thickness of the bread is about 2.5 cm. The bread density is around 0.3-0.4 g/ml, meaning a slice this size roughly weighs 40-60 g. The melasse and butter together are spread thinly on top. Butter spread looks to be about 3-4 mm thick over the surface (approx 12 cm x 5 cm = 60 cm²), giving a volume of approximately 2-2.5 ml of butter, density ~0.9 g/ml → around 2-3 g butter. The melasse is a thin glaze, maybe 1-2 ml volume with density close to 1 g/ml → 1-2 g melasse. Combined toppings weigh about 3-5 g. Total weight combining bread and toppings is about 45-65 g. Given all this, a final estimate for the weight of the 'tartine mélasse + beurre' is about 55 g. This fits physically on the plate and scales with typical slice sizes and spreads. The tartine includes both bread and topping."

The specified food item is 'avocat' (avocado). It is located near the top-center of the wrap, sliced into three visible pieces. The avocado slices are placed on a standard dinner plate (≈ 26-28 cm diameter), with the wrap also helping for scale. The avocado slices together cover approximately 8 cm in length and about 3 cm width. Assuming an average thickness of 1 cm for avocado slices, the volume is roughly 8 x 3 x 1 = 24 cm³. The density of raw avocado is about 0.9 g/ml, so the estimated weight is about 24 grams. A low estimate given slightly less thickness could be 18 g, and a high estimate with slightly thicker slices or more hidden avocado would be up to 30 g. The calculated weight range is plausible considering the portion shown and the plate size."

The specified food item is salade de céleri, which is located in the lower right section of the plate. The plate itself is a standard dinner plate, approximately 27 cm in diameter, providing a reference scale. The portion of salade de céleri measures roughly 8 cm by 6 cm on the plate, with an estimated height of around 2 cm because the salad is shredded and loosely piled. This gives a volume estimate of about 8 * 6 * 2 = 96 ml. Celery salad, being shredded raw vegetable mixed with some dressing, typically has a density around 0.3 to 0.4 g/ml, given the air incorporated and the moisture content. Using a median density of 0.35 g/ml, the weight estimate is 96 ml * 0.35 = 33.6 g. A low-high range based on density variation (0.3–0.4 g/ml) gives approximately 29 g to 38 g. This value fits well visibly, given the size and the volume on the plate, and no container weight is involved. Therefore, a reasonable single estimate is 34 grams."

The specified food is 'beurre' (butter), which is spread visibly on two slices of bread on a standard dinner plate (approx. 26-28 cm diameter). Comparing the butter spread area relative to the bread slice (about 12-14 cm wide and 8-10 cm tall each), the butter layer is thin and covers most of the bread surface but is not thick, typically around 2-3 mm. Assuming a spread thickness of roughly 2 mm over an area of about 110 cm² per slice, the total volume of butter is approximately 22 ml (2 slices combined). Butter density is about 0.9 g/ml. So the butter mass is volume * density = 22 ml * 0.9 g/ml = 19.8 g. Considering possible measurement uncertainty, a plausible low-high range is 15-25 g. The estimated weight of butter here is 20 g, comfortably inside the range and visually realistic for the spread thickness."

The specified food item is the salad which consists of green lettuce, carrots, avocado, olive oil, and vinegar. The salad is placed on a standard dinner plate of about 26-28 cm diameter, covering roughly one third of the plate area. Given the visible volume, the salad is loosely piled about 2-3 cm high. Considering average densities for raw vegetables and avocado, which range from 0.3 to 0.6 g/ml, we estimate the salad volume as approximately 15 cm x 10 cm x 2.5 cm = 375 ml. Adjusting for mixed leafy and denser components, an average density of 0.4 g/ml is used. Multiplying volume by density gives 375 ml * 0.4 g/ml = 150 g approximately. A low-high range from about 120 g to 180 g is plausible given the mix and dressing included. The final estimate at 150 g fits well and seems realistic for the salad portion shown."

The specified food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries). They are located on the left side of a small dessert plate, which is approximately 20 cm in diameter. Using the plate as a reference, the group of blueberries occupies roughly a 7 cm by 4 cm area with a height of about 1.5 cm (considering they are small spherical fruits stacked mostly in a single layer). Calculating an approximate volume: 7 cm x 4 cm x 1.5 cm = 42 ml. Blueberries have a density close to 1 g/ml due to their water content and pulp. Therefore, estimated weight is around 42 grams. A low-high plausible range might be 35-50 grams, considering slight varying sizes and hidden layers. The estimate fits the visible quantity and physically fits in the space they occupy on the plate."

The specified food is 'beurre' (butter). In the image, butter is spread thinly on two slices of bread on a dessert plate, approximately 20 cm in diameter. Each bread slice appears to be around 10-12 cm long and 5-6 cm wide. The butter layer is thin, about 1-2 mm thick. Butter density is about 0.9 g/ml. Estimating each slice has roughly 60 cm² covered area with butter; volume = 60 cm² × 0.15 cm (average thickness) ≈ 9 ml per slice, total for two slices ≈ 18 ml. Multiplying by density (0.9 g/ml) gives about 16-17 grams. Considering slight under- or over-spread, a range of 15 to 20 grams is plausible. Final estimate: 17 grams of butter. This fits realistically on the slices without excess or too little coverage."

The bread slice is on a white dinner plate (~26 cm diameter), giving a size reference. The bread slice is roughly 10 cm wide at its widest, and the butter spread appears thin but covers about 60-70% of the bread's visible surface area. Butter density is approximately 0.9 g/ml. The butter layer thickness looks about 2-3 mm thick. Estimating the butter-covered area around 60 cm², volume = 60 cm² * 0.25 cm = 15 ml. Multiplying by the butter density 0.9 g/ml gives about 13.5 g butter. Considering some unevenness and slightly thinner areas, a low-high range of 10-16 g is reasonable, with the final estimate at 14 grams. This is plausible given the visible coverage and typical spread quantities for a slice of bread."

The specified food item is 'glace noisette', which is hazelnut ice cream. It is served in a small bowl with a diameter that appears to be about 15 cm (smaller than a standard dinner plate of 26-28 cm). Using the bowl diameter as reference and the size of the ice cream portion, it spans roughly 8 cm in length, about 4 cm in width, and the height seems around 3 cm, typical for a scoop of ice cream. Estimating volume: 8 cm x 4 cm x 3 cm = 96 ml. Ice cream density varies but is typically around 0.5 to 0.7 g/ml due to air incorporation. Using 0.6 g/ml as a mid-density estimate, mass = 96 ml x 0.6 g/ml = approx. 58 grams. A low-high range would be 50 to 65 grams. The portion is consistent with a typical single scoop of ice cream in a small bowl, making 58 grams a plausible estimate."

The plate is held by one hand, providing an approximate scale with the hand width (~8-10 cm). Each patty is approximately half the width of the hand in diameter. Given this size, each patty likely weighs about 70-90 grams, considering the dense, grain/bean mixture (density ~1 g/ml). Volume per patty approximated as a cylinder: diameter 7 cm → radius 3.5 cm, height 1.8 cm. Volume ≈ π * (3.5)^2 * 1.8 ≈ 70 ml ≈ 70 g each. For 3 patties: total ~210 g. The lower bound (2 patties smaller) is about 140 g and upper bound (slightly bigger, denser) around 240 g. Final estimate placed at 210 g is plausible physically and matches observed size and typical density of such grain-bean patties."

The specified food is riz complet (brown rice). It is placed on a standard dinner plate, which I estimate is about 26-28 cm in diameter. The rice portion covers roughly one quarter of the plate, appearing as a mound approximately 10 cm wide, 6 cm deep (front to back), and about 1.5 cm high, as rice on a plate usually does not pile too high. Volume estimate is thus 10 x 6 x 1.5 = 90 cm³ (ml). Cooked brown rice density is close to 1 g/ml. Therefore, the volume in ml can be converted almost 1:1 to grams. A reasonable low-high range would be 80-100 grams, considering possible compaction and moisture content in the cooked rice. The portion size visually fits well within this range and plate area. I settle on a middle estimate of 90 grams for the riz complet."

The specified food 'salade' is located on a red dinner plate (≈ 26–28 cm diameter). The salad portion is relatively small, about the size of a human hand palm width (≈ 8 cm) but more compact, roughly 6x6 cm in area. The depth is shallow, about 1–1.5 cm. Thus, estimated volume is approx 6 cm x 6 cm x 1.5 cm = 54 ml. Salads are mostly raw vegetables with a density range of 0.2–0.5 g/ml. Given this is a leafy salad with some dressing, I will choose a density of about 0.4 g/ml. This leads to a weight estimate of 54 ml x 0.4 g/ml = 21.6 g. A reasonable low-high range would be 15 g to 30 g to allow for variations in packing and moisture. The final estimate of 22 g fits well within this range and is plausible for the visible portion on the plate."

The plate appears to be a standard dinner plate about 26-28 cm in diameter, giving a good scale reference. Each salami slice has a diameter of about 3-4 cm and thickness about 0.3 cm. There are about 8 visible slices, some overlapping. Estimating the combined volume, approximate dimensions: length about 8 cm, width about 3-4 cm, thickness about 0.3 cm, volume roughly 7-9 cm³. Salami is a dense solid meat product ~1.1 g/ml density. Therefore mass estimate range: 7-9 g approximately. Given possible overlap and edges, a reasonable final estimate is 8 grams. There is no commercial packaging visible, so no standard weight is used. This amount fits plausibly on the plate area shown and matches visible portion size."

The specified food is 'asperges' (asparagus). They are clearly visible on a standard dinner plate estimated at approximately 27 cm in diameter. The asparagus stalks appear to be about 10-15 cm long and about 1.5-2 cm thick on average, with approximately 7 stalks present. The asparagus stalks are lying flat, so the visible depth is approximately their diameter. Volume is thus roughly length × width × height summed over the stalks: 7 stalks × (13 cm length × 1.7 cm width × 1.7 cm height) ≈ 264 cm³. The density for cooked asparagus is about 0.25–0.3 g/ml due to its fibrous and water content (roughly similar to raw vegetables). Applying density 0.3 g/ml, the weight estimate is approximately 264 × 0.3 = 79 g. A low-high estimate based on density range 0.25–0.35 and slight variation in size yields a plausible weight range of about 65 to 90 g. The estimate 79 g fits this range and is physically reasonable for 7 medium-sized asparagus stalks on a plate."

The specified food item is 'pousses de graines'. These are visible in the center of the plate, spread over the spinach leaves and among the cherry tomatoes and falafels. The plate is a standard dinner plate approximately 26-28 cm in diameter, and the visible width of the plate's edge helps gauge portion sizes. The portion of sprouts appears to cover about a 10x10 cm area, with an estimated height of about 1 cm, as they lie relatively flat. This gives a volume approximation of about 100 cm³ (10 cm x 10 cm x 1 cm). The density of raw vegetable sprouts can be estimated at around 0.3-0.4 g/ml because of their mostly air-filled structure. Thus, the weight low-high range is approximately 30-40 grams. The amount visible fits physically and logically within this range without overcrowding the plate. Therefore, a mid-value of 35 grams is a reasonable estimate."

The specified food is 'branche de chocolat,' visually identified as a chocolate bar held in the hand. The chocolate sits partly in a commercial wrapper, a typical individually wrapped chocolate portion. Using the hand as a reference (width about 8-10 cm for the fingers), the chocolate bar is approximately 10-12 cm long and about 2-3 cm wide, with a thickness of about 1 cm typical for such bars. This gives a rough volume around 20-36 cm3 assuming a rectangular prism (length x width x thickness). Chocolate density is dense solid, about 1.1 g/ml, so the weight estimate is volume multiplied by density, roughly 20-36 grams. Known Swiss single portion chocolate bars, especially for nutty chocolate branches, range between 35-50 grams, but this bar appears somewhat thinner or shorter than a full-size bar. Therefore, a plausible low-high range is 20-40 grams. The chocolate bar is not large, fits easily in the hand, and the weight estimate aligns with known portion sizes. Final estimate set at 30 grams, safely in the middle of the plausible range and physically consistent with the image."

The specified food is 'galettes millet haricots noirs maïs', which are visible on the right side of the container. The container is a square glass dish roughly 15 cm by 15 cm based on the wooden table width and the size of the food. Each galette is about 5 cm long, 3 cm wide, and approximately 2 cm thick, a reasonable estimate given standard falafel or veggie patty size. There are 5 galettes stacked tightly. Volume per galette = 5 x 3 x 2 = 30 cm3. Density of these patties (millet, black beans, corn) is likely dense, approximately 1 g/cm3, similar to cooked legumes and grains. Weight per galette is about 30 g. With 5 galettes, the total weight is around 150 g. Low-high plausible range is 120-180 g considering density variation and possible moisture content. The final estimate of 150 g fits well in this range and aligns with typical homemade veggie patty weights."

The specified food is 'oeuf' (egg), visible as half a hard-boiled egg on the right side of the plate. The plate is a standard dinner plate, approximately 26-28 cm diameter, providing a reference scale. A half hard-boiled egg is about half the size of a typical whole chicken egg, which weighs around 50 grams. Therefore, half an egg would weigh roughly 25 grams. The visible egg portion looks like a normal boiled egg half with typical density close to 1 g/ml for cooked eggs. The low-high estimate range for a half egg is about 20-30 grams. The estimate is plausible given it fits physically and visually on the plate as half an egg. Hence, the final estimate is 25 grams."

The specified food is 'épinards frais' (fresh spinach) that is clearly visible in the bowl as large green leaves forming the base of the dish. The bowl shown is approximately a standard dinner bowl, around 18–20 cm wide, smaller than a dinner plate but larger than a dessert plate. The spinach leaves cover most of the bowl's surface but are somewhat flat and layered. Estimating the surface area covered to be around 15 cm by 12 cm, and the roughly flat layer height around 1–1.5 cm since the leaves are naturally thin and slightly overlapping. This gives a volume estimate around 180 cm³ (15 * 12 * 1) to 270 cm³ (15 * 12 * 1.5). Since fresh spinach leaves have a very low density, roughly 0.2–0.3 g/ml (grams per cubic centimeter), using 0.25 g/ml as average density. Multiplying: 180 cm³ * 0.25 g/cm³ = 45 g (low) and 270 cm³ * 0.25 g/cm³ = 67.5 g (high). These values are physically plausible for the amount of visible spinach, which looks like a medium salad serving. Therefore, a reasonable single number estimate would be around 55 grams as a mid-value. This fits well with volume, density, and visual appearance in the bowl."

The specified food item is beurre (butter), located on the right side of the plate near the edge. The plate can be approximated as a standard dinner plate, about 26-28 cm in diameter. The butter portion is a small, thick rectangle roughly 3 cm by 1.5 cm across and about 1.5 cm thick based on visible dimensions. This translates roughly to a volume of 3 x 1.5 x 1.5 = 6.75 cm3 (ml). Butter density is close to 0.9 g/ml. Thus, estimated weight = volume x density ≈ 6.75 x 0.9 = about 6 grams. A plausible low-high range would be 5-8 grams considering slight thickness variation. This piece fits physically on the plate and looks like a small pat of butter typically served at a meal. Therefore, the estimate is plausible and consistent with the visual scale and density."

The specified food is 'beurre' (butter). The butter is on the plate in a small chunk next to the grilled bread slices. Using the standard dinner plate diameter of approximately 27 cm as a reference, the butter portion appears roughly 4 cm long, 2 cm wide, and about 1 cm high. This results in an estimated volume of about 8 cubic centimeters (4 x 2 x 1). Considering that butter has a density close to 0.9 g/ml (or g/cm3), the mass estimate ranges from about 7 to 9 grams. This size and weight are plausible for a typical butter serving on a plate with bread. Therefore, the final weight estimate is 8 grams."

The specified food item is 'parmesan', which appears to be mixed and melted within the risotto aux asperges on the plate. There is no visible separate portion or block of parmesan cheese; rather, it is likely incorporated into the dish and not separately visible as a distinct ingredient. The plate used is a standard dinner plate with an approximate diameter of 26-28 cm. The risotto portion covers roughly a 10-12 cm diameter area, with a height of about 2-3 cm, which is consistent with a typical serving size. The parmesan cheese is blended into the risotto, so to estimate its weight we consider the typical amount added to such a serving of about 150-180 g of risotto. Parmesan is dense solid cheese with a weight roughly close to 1 g/ml. Usually, parmesan added to risotto is around 10% of the total risotto weight, mostly grated and mixed in. Taking 10% of about 160 g risotto mass gives 16 g parmesan. Given volume and dish integration, a plausible low-high range would be 10-20 g. Final estimate: 16 g parmesan within the risotto, as the visible portion confirms typical portion size and integration."

The plate is a standard dinner plate, approximately 27 cm in diameter, providing a scale reference. The hummous mound measures roughly 5 cm wide, 4 cm deep (height), and about 2 cm thick. Estimating its volume as an irregular oval shape, roughly 5 cm x 4 cm x 2 cm = 40 ml. Hummous typically has a density between 0.9 and 1.1 g/ml. Using 1 g/ml as a reasonable average: 40 ml x 1 g/ml = 40 g. Considering slight compaction and visual firmness, a weight range of 35-45 g is plausible.

The flakes cover roughly half the bottom surface of the bowl in a relatively thin, flat layer of about 0.5 cm depth. Estimating the area they cover at approximately 8 cm by 6 cm (half the bowl’s base), the volume is about 8 cm x 6 cm x 0.5 cm = 24 ml. Considering oat flakes have a typical density around 0.4-0.5 g/ml (raw dry flakes are light and loose), the weight range is 24 ml x 0.4 g/ml = 9.6 g to 24 ml x 0.5 g/ml = 12 g. This fits plausibly with a handful of dry oats visually seen here. The final estimate is set near the middle of this range for best accuracy."

Given the visual scale relative to the plate and fork, the volume of tomatoes is roughly 3 slices × 3.5 cm × 3 cm × 1 cm ≈ 31.5 cm³. Tomatoes have a density close to 1 g/ml, so this volume closely corresponds to weight in grams. A low estimate considering some hidden pulp might be around 25 grams, and a high estimate considering full slice thickness could be up to 35 grams. The final estimate of 30 grams fits well within this range and is a plausible portion size for the tomato slices shown."

The specified food item is 'huile de lin' (linseed oil). Visually scanning the dish, there is no visible pool or separate container of oil; it is likely used as a dressing or mixed with the vegetables or other components. Since the oil is transparent and liquid, it would spread thinly. The plate diameter is about 26-28 cm (standard dinner plate), the food portions are moderate. Typically, a drizzle of oil on such a dish might be approximately 1 tablespoon (about 15 ml = 15 g). The oil would not appear as a visible volume but must be accounted for realistically. Density for linseed oil is close to 0.92 g/ml, but for estimation 1 g/ml is acceptable. Low estimate could be as little as 5 g (a thin drizzle), high estimate around 15-20 g (one tablespoon). Given the food presentation and no visible excess, a reasonable estimate is about 10 g of linseed oil used in this dish. This fits the plausible culinary usage and the plate size."

There are 7 visible raspberries, with none clearly hidden. Estimated volume per raspberry is about a sphere with diameter ~3 cm, volume = 4/3 * π * (1.5)^3 ≈ 14 ml. Using the density of raspberries as raw fruit ~0.4 g/ml (mid-range for raw berries). Total volume for 7 raspberries ≈ 7 * 14 = 98 ml, mass = 98 ml * 0.4 g/ml = 39.2 g. Considering slight air gaps and variable size, a reasonable low-high range is 30-45 g. The final estimate, safely within this range, is 40 g."

The specified food is 'biscuit'. In the image, the biscuit appears as light-colored, broken pieces placed on top of the ice cream in a tall dessert glass approximately 15-18 cm tall. Using the standard dessert plate beneath (20 cm diameter) as a scale reference, the visible biscuit fragments measure about 6-8 cm long and about 3-4 cm wide, with an estimated thickness of about 0.3 cm for multiple overlapping pieces. The total visible volume of biscuit fragments is roughly 6 cm x 4 cm x 0.3 cm = 7.2 cubic cm. Since biscuits are dense solids, their density is about 1 g/cm³. Therefore, the estimated weight of the biscuit pieces is about 7 grams. Reasonably, considering some hidden parts and crumbs, the low-high range would be 6 to 9 grams, making 7 grams a plausible final estimate."

The specified food is 'tomme fleurette', located on the plate as the triangular, soft cheese piece with a white rind near the bottom middle-right of the plate. The plate is a standard dinner plate, about 26–28 cm diameter, serving as the reference scale. The cheese slice measures roughly 5 cm long, 3 cm wide, and about 1 cm thick. Volume estimated as 5 x 3 x 1 = 15 cm³ (or ml). Soft cheeses like tomme fleurette typically have a density around 1 g/ml. So, estimated weight is about 15 grams. Considering natural variation, a plausible low-high range is 12–20 grams. This estimate fits the size and plausible portions for such cheese slices on the plate."
p8a2w5,barre de chocolat kinder,21.0,21,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/0845ef8b-a437-4236-a4f5-49280aac5c51,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is a 'barre de chocolat kinder'. The image shows a single Kinder chocolate bar placed on a wooden surface with visible grain. Known standard single-serve Kinder chocolate bars typically weigh around 21 grams. The bar is compact, about the length of a typical adult finger (~7-9 cm), and roughly 2 cm wide and 1.5 cm thick. Using the wooden surface texture as a reference for scale, the size and density appear consistent with a known weight of 21 g, as commercially sold. No packaging is visible around the chocolate bar, so the weight corresponds to the edible portion. Given the dimensions and typical densities of chocolate (~1.2 g/cm3) and the small size of the bar, the weight falls inside a plausible range of 18-25 grams. Thus, the best estimate is the known commercial weight for the standard single Kinder chocolate bar, which is 21 grams."
xjvrtk,œuf dur,50.0,50,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/b53715cb-f3f5-4abf-bd1d-b7264f7f0a86,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is œuf dur (hard-boiled egg), which is located on the left side of the plate as two halves. The plate appears to be a standard dinner plate, approximately 26–28 cm in diameter, providing a size reference. The egg halves each seem to be about 4-5 cm long, consistent with the size of an average chicken egg. Typically, a whole hard-boiled egg weighs around 50 grams. These appear to be two halves of one egg, so the total weight estimate should be close to one whole egg. Density of a hard-boiled egg is roughly 1.0 g/ml, but since this is a whole solid item, we use standard weight values. The low-high range can reasonably be 45-55 grams based on size. The final estimate is 50 grams, fitting well with a typical egg size and fitting physically on the plate halves as seen."

The specified food items are 'galettes millet, haricots noirs, maïs', which appear to be combined into patties on the right side of the bowl. I will focus on these patties. The bowl looks like a standard cereal bowl, roughly 15-18 cm in diameter, which is smaller than a dinner plate but larger than a dessert plate. There are 5 patties visible, each about 6-7 cm in diameter, roughly 1 to 1.5 cm thick. Given the size relative to the bowl and the typical density of cooked patties (dense solids ≥ 1 g/ml), and considering the ingredients (millet, black beans, corn) which are dense but contain some air, I estimate density around 1 g/ml. Volume per patty: approximately 6.5 cm diameter circle (area ≈ 33 cm²) × 1.2 cm thickness = about 40 ml. Multiplying by 1 g/ml density gives 40 g per patty. For 5 patties, total is about 200 g. A low-high plausible weight range might be 180-220 g to consider slight thickness variance and some charring loss. Thus, final estimate is 200 g, which fits physically in the bowl portion and matches visible size and likely density."
2ahgvr,crème de marrons,13.0,13,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/6b1cc73c-e22b-4132-970e-e37910b8b407,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'crème de marrons,' which is spread on a piece of bread. The bread piece size can be gauged as roughly 8 cm in length based on a visual estimation compared to typical plate and hand sizes; the spread covers the visible top of the bread. The spread thickness appears to be around 0.3 to 0.5 cm. Using a length of approximately 8 cm and an estimated width of 3.5 cm, the surface area is about 28 cm². Assuming a spread thickness of about 0.4 cm, the volume of the crème de marrons is 28 cm² × 0.4 cm = 11.2 ml approximately. Crème de marrons has a density close to a thick preserve, roughly 1.2 g/ml, so multiplying 11.2 ml × 1.2 g/ml gives about 13.4 grams. A low-high estimate would range from 10 to 16 grams considering possible variability in spread thickness and coverage. The estimate of ~13 grams is plausible given the visible area and thickness of spread on the piece of bread."
p96w4a,tarte à la rhubarbe,105.0,105,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/e0c92380-fc15-4bbe-90fb-cc2936321050,"Let’s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The plate used is a standard dinner plate, approximately 26–28 cm in diameter, which provides a good size reference. The slice of tarte à la rhubarbe appears to be about one-eighth of a full pie, judging from its shape and size relative to the plate. The slice measures roughly 12 cm in length and about 7 cm at its widest point. The depth of the tart filling seems to be around 2.5 cm, consistent with typical homemade fruit tart thickness. Calculating the volume as a triangular prism: area of the base (approx. 0.5 x 12 cm x 7 cm = 42 cm²) times height (2.5 cm) gives a volume of roughly 105 ml, which we approximate as 105 g, given the density of a fruit tart with pastry and custard filling is close to 1 g/ml. Considering some variability in pastry density and filling moisture, a reasonable low-high range would be 90-120 g. This fits well with physical size and typical tart slice weights. Therefore, the final weight estimate for the tarte à la rhubarbe slice is 105 g."
