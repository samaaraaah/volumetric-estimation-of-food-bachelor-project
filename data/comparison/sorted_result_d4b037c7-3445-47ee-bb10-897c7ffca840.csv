xjvrtk,courgette et oignons,300.0,145.0,155.0,5.640465793304221,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a glass container with two distinct food portions. On the left side, there is a cooked mixture of courgette (zucchini) and onions, with visible pieces of both vegetables. The courgettes are cut into small chunks and the onions are sliced. Given the container and the volume, the vegetable portion occupies about half of the container's area and appears moderately packed but not dense. Swiss cooked vegetable portions typically range from 200-300 grams, but since this is mixed and occupies about half the container (the rest being the millet patties), the portion looks to be smaller. I estimate a plausible weight range between 120 and 170 grams. Choosing a midpoint, considering the visible volume and reasonable density, I estimate the weight of the courgette et oignons portion to be about 145 grams."
xjvrtk,salade,30.0,140.0,110.0,0.4002911208151383,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/f490015b-1246-4f64-b1f7-b1f486e3fe67,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The salade is on the left side of a red plate. It consists mainly of green leafy lettuce leaves with some sunflower seeds sprinkled on top. The portion is somewhat fluffy and loosely arranged, covering about a quarter of the plate's surface area. Compared to the risotto portion, the salad is noticeably less dense and voluminous. Considering Swiss salad portion guidelines (250-400g per serving) and the fact this is a medium-sized side salad rather than a large main salad, the estimated weight should be on the lower side of the range. The leaves seem fresh and slightly wilted but not compacted. Therefore, I estimate the salad weight at around 120-160 grams, with a midpoint of about 140 grams being plausible and consistent with the visible volume and density."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,315.0,102.0,5.1593886462882095,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate filled with a tomato salad (salade de tomates), consisting mainly of sliced tomatoes, some green leaves (possibly basil), sprinkled with flax seeds (graines de lin), and dressed with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. The tomato slices cover most of the plate and appear thick, with about 10-12 sizeable wedges visible. Swiss average tomato weight per slice of this approximate size is around 30-40 grams. Given the plate size, the tomato portion seems moderately heaped but not overloaded, suggesting a total weight in the range of about 280-350 grams. Factoring in that some pieces might be partially overlapping or thinner at edges, a confident weight estimate is around 315 grams. This also aligns well with typical tomato salad portions for one to two servings and the overall visual volume on the plate. I exclude the weight of the flax seeds and dressing as they are minimal compared to the tomato mass."
xjvrtk,tomates cerises,500.0,400.0,100.0,6.06501698204755,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/5ccbcf64-3631-48df-9e8a-85fb33dbf912,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. In the image, there is a cardboard container filled with cherry tomatoes ('tomates cerises'), some still attached to the vine. There are around 18 tomatoes visible. A typical cherry tomato weighs approximately 20-25 grams. Considering the size and ripeness shown, and that most are on the smaller side of a standard cherry tomato, an average of 20 grams per tomato is reasonable. Multiplying 18 tomatoes by 20 grams gives a range roughly between 360 grams if all were 20g, and up to 450g if some were closer to 25g. Visual volume and density support this range, as the container is reasonably full but not excessively packed. Therefore, a midpoint estimate of around 400 grams is appropriate and consistent with Swiss portion sizing and visual cues."
xjvrtk,galettes millet haricots noirs maïs,155.0,250.0,95.0,1.7861475012130035,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food is 'galettes millet haricots noirs maïs,' which are visible on the right side of the glass container. There are five small galettes tightly packed and visibly dense, containing millet grains, black beans, and corn kernels. Each galette appears roughly the size of a large cookie, about 6-7 cm in diameter and about 1-1.5 cm thick. Given the density of these ingredients (millet, beans, and corn), each galette likely weighs between 40-60 grams. With five galettes, the total weight range would be approximately 200-300 grams. The middle of this range, about 250 grams, seems reasonable based on the visual volume and density compared to the container and the accompanying cooked vegetables. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the 'galettes millet haricots noirs maïs' in the container to be about 250 grams."
wrah5h,poire,175.0,85.0,90.0,1.9104803493449782,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/8487ef93-2680-471e-986f-692657cd360f,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows several pieces of a pear (poire) cut into chunks inside a rectangular plastic container. The pieces vary in size but generally reflect about half of a medium pear in total volume, considering typical pear size and density. A whole medium pear usually weighs around 160-180 grams. Given these chunks fill about half the volume of a whole pear, the estimated total weight here should be roughly 80-90 grams. Taking the midpoint and accounting for possible visual reduction in size due to container shape, I estimate the poire weight to be approximately 85 grams."
xjvrtk,galettes millet haricots noirs maïs,200.0,285.0,85.0,2.062105773896167,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/32289b41-a85a-4563-8e38-c47e7693d2d0,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The galettes millet haricots noirs maïs are the three round patties positioned on the right-center of the bowl. They look fairly dense with visible corn kernels and black beans mixed throughout, suggesting an ingredient base that's compact. Each galette appears to be roughly 7-8 cm in diameter and about 1.5-2 cm thick. Given their density and size, each galette likely weighs between 80 and 110 grams. Since there are three such galettes, the total weight is plausibly between 240 and 330 grams. The middle ground estimate around 285 grams fits well with these observations. Considering the other food items on the plate (green salad, mushrooms, and beetroot lentil purée), which occupy less volume, this estimate is consistent with the galette portion appearing as the main bulk. The typical Swiss portion for such lentil-based patties tends to be around 200-300 grams, so this estimate aligns well with both visual and reference information."
p96w4a,croissants au jambon,37.0,120.0,83.0,0.3725133430373605,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/7bd6e67d-b1ca-42e4-a5ca-713b7fadda27,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two ham croissants (croissants au jambon) on the plate. Each croissant is of typical small to medium size, with visible layers and a golden-brown crust, indicating a flaky texture but moderate density. Given their size and typical Swiss portion standards for ham croissants, each one is likely around 50-70 grams. Since there are two croissants, the total weight should be roughly 100-140 grams. Considering the visible portion size, I estimate the total weight of the two croissants au jambon to be about 120 grams."
r3bub9,salade verte,21.0,100.0,79.0,0.2012372634643377,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/r3bub9/dish_media/d936efff-6fc8-4d66-8681-db5d7fd4f9c4,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The salade verte is located on the bottom right side of the plate, consisting of leafy green lettuce with a light creamy dressing. The portion appears to be relatively small compared to typical Swiss salad servings, likely because it is part of a mixed plate with several other side salads and a meat portion. The leaves are loosely layered, and the density is low, so this portion weighs less than a dense vegetable serving. Considering typical Swiss salad portion ranges (250-400g) but factoring the smaller amount here as a side dish, the estimated weight likely falls between 80 to 120 grams. Taking the midpoint and visual cues into account, I estimate the salade verte weighs approximately 100 grams."
p96w4a,asperges,73.0,150.0,77.0,0.6818292091217856,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/0513b8db-8592-4ef7-aacf-c117d4030b25,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The asperges (asparagus) are identifiable as a small bundle of green stalks on the plate beside the potatoes, ham, and mayonnaise. There are about 9 to 10 stalks, medium thickness, and they appear to be cooked but not overly dense. Considering the length and average thickness of each stalk, and comparing to the size of the potatoes and the ham slices nearby, the asparagus portion looks like a typical side vegetable serving. Swiss vegetable side portions range from 200-300g, but this is a rather modest portion. Estimating conservatively, the asparagus weight should be in the range of 120-180g. A midpoint estimate is around 150g, which fits visually with the quantity and dimensions observed. This estimate accounts for the bulkiness and moderate density of cooked asparagus."
xjvrtk,salade,15.0,90.0,75.0,0.13646288209606988,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/7e8fa753-bb2d-4ee9-983c-7c9ce95fe698,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The salade is a small portion located on the right side of the plate, consisting of a few leafy greens with some additional components like pieces of onion or mushrooms. It occupies a small area and looks loosely packed. Given Swiss standards where salads range from 250 to 400 grams as full servings, this portion appears to be significantly smaller, likely a side salad or garnish portion. Visually, this salad portion looks like about 75 to 110 grams based on its volume and density. Estimating a midpoint value, considering the salad is not dense and fairly small, 90 grams is a reasonable estimate."
p8a2w5,tarte aux fraises,164.0,90.0,74.0,1.4721009218825813,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/7b64b358-b611-4155-8e79-6f3ce5b4f11a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a typical slice of strawberry tart (tarte aux fraises) on a dessert plate. The slice has a visible layer of pastry crust at the bottom, a creamy custard filling, and several whole strawberries along with some small red currants on top. The size of the slice relative to the plate is about one-eighth of a standard tart, suggesting a moderate portion. Considering a typical full tart weight between 600 and 800 grams, an eighth would weigh roughly between 75 and 100 grams. The density of the tart is composed mainly of the buttery pastry, the creamy filling, and fruit topping. The visible strawberries appear fresh and sizeable, about 6-7 whole strawberries on the slice, estimated at around 10-12 grams each on average when whole, but as this slice contains smaller quantities due to toppings arrangement and partial coverage, the tart slice weight including all components is plausibly around 90 grams. The internal plausible weight range is about 75-105 grams, so a midpoint estimate near 90 grams is reasonable and consistent with Swiss dessert portion sizes."

The target food is 'riz complet' (brown rice), which is located at the upper left part of the blue plate. The pile of rice appears to be a moderately sized serving, roughly covering an area about the size of a medium fist, with a somewhat loose texture typical of cooked brown rice. Given the plate size and comparing the rice portion to the salmon and salad portions, the rice does not appear excessively piled or sparse. Swiss reference portion size for cooked rice is about 150-180g per serving. Considering this rice looks like a standard single serving portion, but slightly spread thin rather than densely packed, I establish a plausible range of 140-170g. The mid-point estimate around 155g aligns well with the visual volume observed and contextual portion sizes on the plate. Thus, I estimate the brown rice portion to weigh approximately 155 grams."

The salade de céleri is the white shredded pile located at the bottom right of the plate. The portion is relatively compact, not spread out, and has a dense but fibrous texture typical of celery root salad, likely mixed with a light dressing. Compared to the carrot salad on the same plate, it appears slightly less voluminous but similarly dense. Given typical Swiss portions for vegetable salads ranging around 200-300g but observing that this portion is modest and possibly a side dish rather than a large serving, I estimate the weight to be between 100 and 140 grams. The midpoint and best estimate based on the visual volume and density is about 120 grams. This fits well with the relative size on the plate and the distribution compared to other items."

The 'viande' (meat) is located at the bottom left of the plate and appears to be a cooked ground meat patty, roughly the size of a palm with a thickness around 1-2 cm. Compared to the potatoes (which are baby/petit potatoes) and the leafy salad on the plate, the meat looks to be a moderate portion rather than a large steak or multiple pieces. Swiss typical cooked meat portions range from 120-180g, and this portion appears slightly below average given its size and distribution. I estimate a plausible range of about 100-130g, with a midpoint closer to 115g. This estimate takes into account the visible density and thickness of the patty and its relative size on the plate compared with the potatoes and salad portions."

The maréchal is visible on the plate as several small cubes gathered near the slices of cucumber and the salad leaves. Visually, they appear to be cheese cubes roughly 2 cm on a side. There are about 5 cubes visible. Considering that cheese density is fairly high and each cube of this size weighs around 15-20 grams, the total weight is likely in the range of 75 to 100 grams. Given the visual volume and the number of cubes, I estimate the weight of the maréchal cheese on the plate to be about 85 grams, near the midpoint of this range."

The myrtilles (blueberries) are visible mixed within a bowl of yogurt and cereal. Given their size relative to the spoon and bowl, they are whole blueberries scattered throughout the mix. Blueberries generally weigh about 0.5 to 1 gram each. Visually, there appear to be around 30 to 40 blueberries distributed in the mixture. Considering the mixture’s volume and the blueberries' density, the total weight of blueberries likely falls between 20 and 40 grams. Given these observations, I estimate the blueberry weight to be around 30 grams, which fits well within the plausible range and matches the typical quantity in such a breakfast bowl."

The image shows a single red apple ('pomme') placed on a flat surface. Given the typical size and shape of the apple visible, it seems to be a small to medium apple rather than a large one. The apple has its skin intact, which is included in the weight. Typical Swiss apple portions range from 150 to 300 grams depending on size, but this apple looks closer to the smaller side. Considering its proportions and comparing it to common apple weights, a reasonable weight estimate is between 140 and 180 grams. Picking a midpoint value for accuracy, the apple likely weighs about 160 grams."
2ahgvr,salade grecque,315.0,250.0,65.0,2.4836244541484715,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/c476a6d0-acb2-45fd-b168-84822bc98003,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a rectangular plastic container filled about halfway with a Greek salad (salade grecque). The salad contains mostly finely diced vegetables such as red and yellow bell peppers, cucumbers, some onions, olives, and visible small cubes of feta cheese. The container appears to be a common food storage container, roughly medium-sized, and the salad fills approximately half its depth and most of its surface area. Given the dense, chopped nature of the salad and mixed solid ingredients, this is likely around 200-300 grams in total. Greek salads are vegetable-based with some cheese and tend to be medium density. Considering Swiss portion sizes for salads (250-400g per serving), but noting this is not overflowing the container and looks like a moderate portion, I'd estimate a range of about 220 to 280 grams. Choosing the midpoint, the weight estimate for the salade grecque present is approximately 250 grams."

The salad is a mixed one with green leafy lettuce, slices of carrots, and pieces of avocado, dressed with a tablespoon of olive oil and a tablespoon of vinegar. Visually, the salad occupies roughly one-third to half of a standard-sized plate but is loosely piled, indicating a light density due to the leafy greens and vegetables. The avocado pieces are visible in small chunks interspersed with the lettuce leaves and carrots. Considering Swiss typical vegetable salad portions are around 250-400g, and that this portion appears moderate but not large, I estimate the weight to be in the lower-mid range of that scale. The avocado presence adds some density but does not hugely increase volume. I assess the salad weight to be between 180g and 270g, roughly centered around 225g. This is consistent with the visible portion size and the composition of the salad."

The image shows a small amount of pasta salad ('salade de pâtes') on a plate, consisting mainly of penne pasta, some corn kernels, a few pieces of cherry tomato, and small bits of herbs and other ingredients. The pasta pieces are scattered and the total volume is quite small, roughly occupying a small central area of the plate. Given the size of the pasta pieces and the sparse distribution, the portion appears to be well below a standard single Swiss portion of cooked pasta (~180-250g). Considering the pasta density and the small quantity of vegetables mixed in, a plausible weight range is about 40-60 grams. Choosing a midpoint close to 50 grams fits the visual evidence best. This estimate also aligns with the fact that the pasta is just a small leftover portion rather than a full serving."

The galette millet maïs haricots noirs is the two small patties located near the bottom center of the container. Each galette seems compact with visible black bean pieces and a grainy millet base. Considering their size relative to the container and the adjacent portions of salad and cheese, each galette weighs somewhat less than a typical main protein portion but still substantive as a plant-based protein source. Given typical Swiss portions and the visual volume, the combined weight for the two galettes is likely between 120g and 160g. Placing the estimate near the midpoint, I approximate the total weight of the galettes to be 140 grams."

The tiramisu slice is on the left side of the plate and shows a typical layered structure with mascarpone cream and soaked sponge. The portion size is moderate, about half the length of an average dessert plate diameter (about 18-20 cm). The depth and density of the tiramisu layers suggest a moist, medium-density cake. Comparing the tiramisu portion to the forêt noir slice next to it, which is thinner and denser, the tiramisu portion looks slightly larger in volume but less dense. Swiss dessert portions commonly range from 100g to 150g for a slice of this size. Considering the moistness and visible size, the tiramisu slice is likely around 120-140g. A midpoint estimate is therefore 130 grams, which fits well with the visible size and typical density of this dessert."

The apple (pomme) is clearly visible in the image below the croissant. It is a small to medium-sized apple, typical of Swiss apples, with a slightly elongated shape. Based on its size relative to the croissant and the texture of the apple skin, this apple appears to be a common variety weighing less than large apples typical elsewhere. Swiss apples of this size typically weigh between 130 and 180 grams. Given the apple's shape and size, an estimated weight range of 140-170 grams is plausible. I place my final estimate near the midpoint, thus about 155 grams. This estimation fits well with the visible volume and typical Swiss apple weights."

The specified food item is 'pain bis', which is a type of whole grain bread. The image shows two slices of pain bis, one with mayonnaise spread and the other topped with cheese slices and two small cornichons. Each slice looks to be of typical sandwich bread size, roughly 12-15 cm long and 7-8 cm wide, with a medium thickness around 1.5-2 cm. Typical pain bis slices weigh approximately 40-50 grams each depending on thickness and density. Given that both slices appear of average thickness and size, but we are asked only for the estimation of the bread weight (not including toppings), the total weight of the two slices together is likely between 80 and 100 grams. Since the input asked specifically for 'pain bis' (plural not specified, but image shows two slices), I estimate the weight of pain bis (both slices together) around 90 grams. This considers typical bread density and portion size with visual evidence from the image."

The target food item is 'pâtes' (pasta), which are spiral-shaped and cooked. They occupy about one third of the plate and are accompanied by a small scoop of mozzarella on top. The pasta portion is moderately dense and not piled very high, suggesting a typical cooked volume. Comparing with the haricots verts and haricots rouges on the same plate, which appear to be side portions, the pasta seems to be the main carbohydrate but not overly large. Swiss cooked pasta portion sizes typically range between 180-250g, but given the visual volume here, it looks closer to a moderate sized serving likely on the lower to midpoint of that range. I estimate an internal weight range of 150-200g, with a final estimate at the midpoint of about 175g. This accounts for the moderate density and visible volume without overestimating thickness or compactness."

Each wedge likely represents about half a medium-sized tomato or less. A medium tomato usually weighs around 150-170 grams whole, so half would be roughly 75-85 grams. However, these tomato wedges are slightly thick but not whole halves, so the combined weight of the two wedges is expected around 70-90 grams. Considering the visible size and density of the tomato flesh, I estimate the tomatoes weigh about 80 grams. This fits well within reasonable Swiss portion sizes and the visible tomato amount without overestimating."

The specified food item is 'poulet' (chicken). On the plate, the chicken portion is a single breast piece with some sauce visible underneath. The piece appears to be medium-sized, covering a moderate area on the plate but not overly thick or bulky. Swiss standard portions for chicken range around 120-180g, but given this is one piece with moderate thickness and some visible moisture, it likely leans toward the lower-middle part of the range. The fries and salad portions visually take up considerable space, suggesting the chicken is a reasonable main protein portion but not oversized. Considering the size, thickness, and visual cues, I estimate the chicken breast to weigh between 130g and 160g, with a midpoint estimate of approximately 145g. This fits with typical Swiss portion sizes and the visual context on the plate."

The image shows a small green bowl containing three strawberries ('fraises'). These strawberries are quite large compared to a typical average strawberry. A normal medium-sized strawberry weighs about 15-20 grams. Given the visibly larger size of these strawberries, the largest one might weigh approximately 40-45 grams, while the other two are slightly smaller, likely around 30 grams each. Adding these together gives a rough total weight range of about 95-105 grams. Considering some variation in size and density, I estimate the total weight of the three strawberries to be approximately 100 grams."

The salami is visible on the right side of the plate as a small pile of thinly sliced rounds, with a few small broken pieces. Each slice is relatively thin and about 3-4 cm in diameter. There appear to be about 6-7 slices in total. Typical Swiss salami slices weigh around 10-15 grams per slice depending on thickness and diameter. Given the size and moderate thickness of these slices, the total weight is likely between 50 and 70 grams. Since the slices are not piled thickly, and some are broken into pieces, a reasonable midpoint estimate would be approximately 60 grams. This fits well with the small portion size characteristic of Swiss servings and the visible quantity on the plate."

The sauce bolognese is visible on top of the spaghetti pasta on the plate. It has a thick consistency, covers a central portion of the pasta, and appears to be a moderate amount, not overflowing but enough to create a noticeable layer. Comparing it to the pasta portion, which seems like a typical single serving (roughly 140-160 grams cooked pasta), the sauce is less voluminous but denser than pasta alone. Typical bolognese sauce portions for a single pasta serving range around 80-120 grams in Swiss portions. Here, visually, the portion looks closer to the lower-middle range, considering the depth and coverage. I estimate a plausible range of about 75 to 110 grams for the sauce. Choosing a value near the midpoint, the estimated weight of the sauce bolognese is approximately 92 grams. This fits well with the visible thickness and quantity relative to the rest of the meal and typical portion sizes."

The image shows raw kohlrabi pieces (colrave crue) placed on a white rectangular container lid. Each piece is cut into medium-sized chunks, revealing the light green to white interior typical of kohlrabi. The combined volume looks moderate but not piled high, roughly covering the lid without significant layering. Kohlrabi is quite dense and mostly water. Given the chunk sizes and their spread, the total visible portion likely weighs around 140-180 grams. Considering the moderate size and density, I estimate the weight to be approximately 160 grams."

The image shows a small pile of four Blevita crackers stacked on a wooden surface. Blevita crackers are a processed product with standardized weights. Typically, one Blevita cracker weighs approximately 15 grams. Since there are four crackers visible in the stack, the total weight can be estimated by multiplying the standard single cracker weight by four. This gives an estimated weight of around 60 grams for the four crackers. There is no indication that the crackers are broken or missing pieces, so the weight corresponds to a complete set. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the Blevita crackers shown to be about 60 grams."

The image shows a small bowl filled with fresh blueberries (myrtilles). The bowl is held in a hand, providing a useful size reference. Blueberries typically weigh about 0.8 to 1 gram each. Visually, the bowl contains roughly 50 to 60 blueberries based on counting visible surface berries and estimating some hidden beneath. Swiss typical blueberry container portions are around 150-200 grams, and this amount closely matches a nearly full small bowl. Given the density and volume, I estimate the weight of the blueberries to be approximately 160 grams, with a plausible range from 140 to 180 grams."

The food item to estimate is 'pain' (bread). The image shows three pieces of sliced bread with butter and strawberry jam on them. Each slice is of medium thickness and appears to be from a rustic whole grain or seeded loaf. The slices are roughly oval, each approximating 10-12 cm in length and about 6-7 cm in width, typical dimensions for this type of bread slice. Given the texture and thickness, an average slice of this bread weighs around 40 to 50 grams. Since the slices have some irregular shape and there are some crumbs visible, I estimate each slice to weigh approximately 45 grams. There are three slices visible, but the task is to estimate the weight of one slice. This aligns well with Swiss bread portion sizes for similar bread slices which tend to be around 40-50g per slice. Therefore, the plausible weight range goes from 40g to 50g, and the midpoint estimate is 45g."

The image shows a plate of cooked spaghetti with pesto and some grated gruyère sprinkled. The spaghetti portion occupies most of the plate, appearing moderately piled, not overly heaped, but enough to cover the plate's surface. Using the Swiss portion reference, a typical cooked pasta serving is about 180-250g, but visual cues suggest this portion is closer to the lower middle range. The pesto and cheese are sparse and do not affect the spaghetti weight significantly. Considering the plate size and relative thickness of the pasta pile, the estimation range for the spaghetti is about 150-210 grams. The midpoint estimate would be around 180 grams, which is consistent with a modest full serving of cooked spaghetti without excessive volume. This aligns well with the look of the portion and the surrounding context in the image."

The image shows a metal container with two folded flatbreads or galettes placed inside. These appear to be thin and fairly soft, resembling soft tortillas or lavash type bread. Each galette is approximately 15-20 cm in length and about 8-10 cm in width when folded, with some thickness due to the folding. The galettes are not densely stacked; their overall thickness appears to be roughly 1-1.5 cm per folded piece. Considering standard weights for this type of thin bread, Swiss portions for similar wraps weigh around 45 to 70 grams each. Given that there are two portions here, and one is partially eaten, the total bread amount likely weighs approximately 80-110 grams. Focusing on the target item as a single whole galette (one piece, not the partial one), an estimated weight near the midpoint of 45-70 grams is reasonable. Therefore, the estimated weight for one ""pain/galette"" from this image is about 58 grams. This estimate aligns with typical flatbread portions and the visible size and folding, avoiding overestimation by considering the thinness of the bread and folds."

The image shows a white bowl containing two distinct piles of dry ingredients. The flocon d'avoines (oat flakes) are the lighter beige pile on the right side of the bowl. The quantity is spread thinly and occupies roughly half the bowl's bottom surface area. Considering the size of a typical bowl and the density of dry oat flakes, and comparing visually with the flaxseeds on the left (which are smaller and denser), this amount corresponds to a moderate portion of dry oat flakes. A typical single serving of dry oat flakes ranges between 40-50 grams. Given the volume and density visible here, it fits within a range of about 40-50 grams. I select a midpoint estimate of 45 grams."

The plate shows sliced cooked carrots ('carotte') on one side and a portion of quinoa-bulgur mix on the other. The carrots are cut into pieces about 1-2 cm thick, with approximately 14 slices visible. Each slice appears firm and moist, typical for cooked carrot pieces. Considering the size of the plate and the portion of carrots relative to it, the carrots form a moderate side portion. Swiss cooked vegetable portions range between 200-300g, but here the carrot portion is smaller than a full vegetable portion due to space taken by the quinoa-bulgur mix. I estimate the carrot portion to be roughly half to two-thirds of a standard cooked vegetable portion, roughly 120-180g. A reasonable midpoint estimate is about 150g. This fits the visual size and typical densities, and matches the plate's mixed dish context."

The avocado ('avocat') is clearly visible in the image as two medium-sized slices placed near the top of a galette wrap. A typical medium avocado whole weighs about 150-200g, and here approximately half or slightly less of an avocado is shown, which aligns with the visible slices. Considering the thickness and apparent size of the slices on the wrap, a reasonable weight range for the avocado portion is about 60-80 grams. Given the clear visual size and the typical densities of avocado, I estimate the weight of the avocado here at about 70 grams."

The galettes de millet, haricots noirs et maïs (millet patties with black beans and corn) are visible on the right side of the bowl. There are five patties, each roughly the size of a small palm, about 7-8 cm in diameter, and moderately thick. Considering typical homemade millet and bean patties, each tends to weigh between 40 and 60 grams depending on thickness and ingredients. Given that these patties appear somewhat dense but not overly thick, and considering the five patties in the bowl, an internal plausible range would be approximately 180 to 280 grams for all five combined. This estimate accounts for visual thickness, density of beans and millet, and area covered. The midpoint estimate, about 230 grams, seems reasonable and fits well within Swiss portion expectations for a main plant-based protein dish. This also corresponds logically with the volume relative to the adjacent chopped tomato and onion salad portion."

The bowl is medium-sized, partially filled, and the séré maigre with chia and hazelnut purée appears to be fairly thick and dense. Considering typical serving sizes of séré maigre for one portion mixed with seeds and nut purée, and the size of the bowl relative to the spoon handle, the portion looks approximately in the range of 150-200 grams. Given the partial filling and density, a final estimate near the midpoint, about 175 grams, is plausible and consistent with visible volume."

The red bell pepper (poivron) pieces are visible in the center-left of the plate, cut into strips. They appear to be cooked and are about six to eight medium-sized pieces. Considering the size of a typical red bell pepper and that a portion on this plate is controlled and part of a multi-component meal, the visible amount is likely around half a medium pepper. A whole medium red bell pepper typically weighs around 150 grams. Given the portion size and the visual cues, the poivron portion likely weighs between 60 and 80 grams. Choosing a midpoint to reflect the actual visible quantity, I estimate the poivron weight to be approximately 70 grams."

The 'tomme fleurette' is located on the plate among several pieces of cheese, a slice of baguette, a portion of trout, and some butter. The tomme fleurette piece is the triangular-shaped cheese with a white rind and a soft interior, placed near the bottom center-right of the plate. Its volume is relatively small compared to the slice of bread and the cheese to its left, appearing to be about 3-4 cm wide and 2-3 cm thick at the thickest part. Tomme cheeses tend to be semi-firm and moderately dense. Given this visual size, the piece likely weighs between 30 to 50 grams. Taking the midpoint of this range, I estimate about 40 grams. This estimate fits well with the context that this is one of several cheese pieces on the plate, suggesting moderate portion sizes. The portion is neither very thick nor very large to justify going beyond about 50g, but it is a substantial enough wedge to exceed 30g."

The image shows one 'branche de chocolat' held in a hand, partially unwrapped. This type of chocolate bar is typically a processed confectionery product with a distinct elongated shape, covered in milk chocolate with nut pieces embedded. Judging by the hand size relative to the bar, the chocolate branch appears to be of standard snack size, not overly large or small. Such chocolate bars in Switzerland usually weigh between 40 to 60 grams. Given the visible size and density, a good estimate is close to the midpoint of this range. Therefore, I estimate the weight to be about 50 grams, which is consistent with typical commercial chocolate branches."

The image shows two slices of brown bread on a small black plate. Each slice is standard thickness, approximately comparable to common sandwich bread slices in Switzerland. A typical slice of whole grain or brown bread usually weighs between 30 and 40 grams. Considering the slices appear to be of average thickness and size, I estimate each slice around 35 grams. Since there are two slices, but the target is only ""pain"" (bread) as a general item, I consider the weight of one slice unless otherwise specified. However, the full visible portion of bread consists of two slices. If the entire visible bread portion is considered, the weight is about 70 grams. Given the usual portions and visual size, the estimation for the bread as seen (2 slices) is about 70 grams. For one slice alone it would be around 35 grams. Since the input asks for pain (bread) in singular and both slices are visibly part of the portion, I estimate the total bread weight as 70 grams. This aligns well with typical Swiss bread slice weights without over or underestimating."

The sautéed vegetables (carottes, poireaux) are located on the right side of the plate. They are cut into thin strips and pieces, and appear lightly cooked with a modest volume. The portion looks roughly spread in a moderate depth but does not cover a large area, suggesting a light portion consistent with a side dish. Compared to the rice and fish on the plate, the vegetables look less dense and with some moisture content. Swiss portion sizes for cooked vegetables typically range from 200-300g, but since this is a side portion on a multi-component plate, a lower range is more plausible. Visually, I estimate the vegetables to be about 150-200g, with a midpoint around 175g. This fits well with the observed volume and typical Swiss side vegetable portions."

The target food is 'salade de pâtes', which is located in the bottom left part of the plate. The portion of pasta salad includes visible pasta spirals along with some small vegetable pieces like corn and tomatoes. The quantity appears moderate but not large, fitting roughly the volume of a small side portion. Given that pasta is less dense and cooked pasta typical Swiss portion size is around 180-250g, but considering this plate has multiple side items and the pasta salad occupies less than a quarter of the plate, the portion is likely smaller than a full serving. The depth and density appear moderate, and the amount is consistent with a side salad portion rather than a main dish. I estimate a plausible weight range between 80g and 110g, with a midpoint around 95g. This fits well with the visual volume and the context of other foods on the plate."

The image shows a plate with chips labeled as 'vaya beans'. These chips appear thin and slightly crispy, with some visible green and dark spots that indicate bean ingredients. The plate is a standard-sized dinner plate, and the chips form a pile covering a central portion. The chips do not appear densely stacked and have some air between them, so their volume is somewhat deceptive relative to their weight. Given the thinness and the airy texture typical of bean-based chips, I would expect the weight to be moderate. Considering portion sizes for snack chips, a typical serving ranges between 25-40 grams, and this visible portion looks slightly larger than a single serving but less than a large serving. Thus, an internal weight range of 35-50 grams is plausible. Centering the estimate near the midpoint, I conclude the weight of the chips here is approximately 42 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread ('pain') on a white plate. Each slice appears to be of rustic, artisanal bread with an open crumb and a crusty edge. The size of each slice is roughly that of a medium slice of bread, around 10-12 cm long and 6-7 cm wide, with some thickness visible. Typically, a whole slice of this type of bread weighs approximately 40-50 grams. Since these are two slices, the combined weight would be near 80-100 grams. However, the estimation is requested for the food item 'pain' which can refer to one slice or the total visible amount. Given the original text mentions bread twice, I will assume one slice as the target portion. Therefore, estimating the weight of one slice of this rustic bread to be around 45 grams is reasonable. The slice is not unusually thick or thin, and the density is medium due to the open crumb. This fits well within typical Swiss portion sizes for bread slices. Hence, I estimate the weight of one slice of bread ('pain') visible as approximately 45 grams."

The scrambled eggs (oeufs brouillés) are located on the left side of the plate, characterized by their yellow color and fluffy texture. The portion is moderate in size, covering a visible area roughly equivalent to a medium egg scramble portion. Considering that a typical Swiss portion of eggs for a meal is about 120-150 grams depending on the number of eggs used, and given the visible amount here appears to correspond roughly to 2 eggs worth of scrambled eggs, a weight range of approximately 110-140 grams is reasonable. Given the fluffiness and the spread, I estimate near the middle of this range, around 125 grams. This estimate aligns with the plate composition, where the gnocchi and cauliflower serve as sides, making the eggs likely the main protein portion on this plate."

Considering the container size appears to be a typical small meal prep box approximately 15 cm long, the visible tomato portion is about 10 cm by 7 cm in area with about 1-1.5 cm thickness. Tomatoes have a high water content and density is not very high. This portion corresponds to about half a medium tomato or slightly less. A medium tomato typically weighs around 150-170 grams whole. Given the visible amount is about half, possibly slightly less, the weight would be roughly in the range of 60-80 grams. Estimating near the midpoint of this range, the tomato weight is about 70 grams."

The image shows a piece of bread (pain) with a spread of crème de marrons on top. The crème de marrons covers the visible surface of the bread slice and has a smooth, thick consistency. The portion of crème de marrons looks to be a thin but generous layer, roughly spread over a bread piece about 10 cm long and a few centimeters wide. Considering the density and typical spread thickness of chestnut cream, and comparing the portion size to the bread, the crème de marrons appears to weigh between 25 grams and 40 grams. Choosing the midpoint of this range for a precise estimate results in approximately 33 grams."

The target food is 'pain,' which is a slice of bread visible on the plate. The slice is rustic-style bread, not too thick but fairly dense with crust. It occupies a medium portion of the small plate. Considering the density and typical weight of such bread slices, and based on its size in comparison to the plate's pattern and the hand partially visible in the background, the slice is likely around 60-80 grams. Bread slices like this rarely exceed 100 grams unless very thick. The visible portion appears to be closer to medium thickness and size. I estimate the weight of the 'pain' slice to be about 70 grams, within a plausible range of 60-80 grams."

The blueberries (myrtilles) are clearly visible on the left side of the small plate. There are around 13 blueberries, medium size, quite plump. Blueberries typically weigh between 0.5g and 1g each. Taking a mid value of about 0.9g per blueberry for these large and ripe looking ones, the total would be around 11.7g. Considering some variability in size and possible slight compression or pressing on the plate, a plausible weight range is 10-13g. Since they are naturally light, and considering Swiss portion sizes for berries in servings are around 150-200g but this is clearly a small portion, I estimate the total weight of the myrtilles here to be approximately 12 grams."

The plate contains two slices of pizza and a portion of salad made of grated carrot, corn (mais), cherry tomatoes, and visible leafy greens likely spinach. The salad appears creamy, suggesting it has some dressing mixed in. Visually, the salad occupies about a quarter of the plate. The carrot strands, corn kernels, and halved cherry tomatoes are distinct and provide a good density reference. The portion looks modest and spread out without overly dense piling. Given Swiss salad portion ranges of 250-400g for salads, and noting this is likely a side salad, the amount here is on the smaller side. Considering the volume, visible ingredients, and their density, I estimate the salad weight to be between 130g and 170g. The midpoint and final estimate is approximately 150 grams."

The target food item is the légumes (courgette, oignon, 1 cs d'huile d'olive) visible on the left side of the plate. The vegetables consist of sliced courgettes and onions cooked in about 1 tablespoon of olive oil. The portion size visually fills about one-third of a medium-sized dinner plate, with the vegetables evenly cooked and slightly sautéed. Considering the volume, density, and typical weight of these cooked vegetables, and knowing that cooked vegetables portion ranges are roughly 200-300g in Swiss standards, this portion appears somewhat smaller than a full serving but still reasonable. Since the portion looks moderate, I estimate the légumes to weigh between 140 and 190 grams. The midpoint and final estimate is about 165 grams. This fits well with the visual evidence of vegetable thickness and area coverage on the plate compared to the rice and egg portions."

The target food is the tartine mélasse + beurre, which is the lower slice of bread on the plate. It appears to be a single slice of rustic bread about 15 cm long and 6 cm wide, with a moderate spread of butter and molasses. The bread slice thickness looks typical for a medium slice of country-style bread, around 2 cm thick. Bread weight for such a slice is generally about 40-50 grams. The butter spread seems thin, approximately 5-7 grams, and the molasses layer is light and glossy, roughly 3-5 grams. Combining these, the total weight of the tartine mélasse + beurre is likely between 48 and 62 grams. Placing the estimate near the midpoint gives approximately 55 grams, which aligns with the visible size and typical weights of similar preparations."

In the image, there are four small slices of bread with visible spreads of butter and strawberry jam on each. The butter portion looks thinly spread and does not cover the entire surface thickly. Considering each bread slice is relatively small, typical for Swiss servings, the total visible butter spread across the four slices appears modest. Butter is dense but the thin layer likely weighs around 4-6 grams per slice. Multiplying by four slices results in a total butter weight ranging roughly from 16 to 24 grams. To be precise, I estimate about 20 grams of butter on the plate. This aligns with typical small servings of spread on bread in Swiss meals and fits the visual volume and coverage of butter shown in the image."

The image shows a single 'branche de chocolat,' a chocolate bar with a bumpy texture, lying on a wooden surface. This type of chocolate bar typically weighs around 40 to 50 grams based on its size compared to the wood grain and common product standards for such chocolate sticks in Switzerland. Given its visible length, thickness, and typical density of chocolate, an estimated weight range would be 38 to 50 grams. Selecting a value near the midpoint of this range, I estimate the weight to be approximately 44 grams."

The image shows a single slice of rhubarb tart (tarte à la rhubarbe) on a standard white plate, with a fork and knife nearby for scale. The slice is roughly triangular and occupies around one-sixth to one-eighth of a typical 24 cm tart. The rhubarb pieces on top are cut into small chunks and distributed evenly, typical of a tart with a custard or cream base and a pastry crust. Considering a whole rhubarb tart generally weighs between 800-1000 grams including crust, the slice shown here likely weighs between 100 and 140 grams. Given the moderate thickness and visible fruit topping, a midpoint estimate of about 120 grams is reasonable and consistent with the visual volume and density of such a tart slice."

The target food item is 'toast', which is visible here as two slices of toasted bread on a plate. Each slice is roughly a standard square slice of whole grain bread, toasted. A typical slice of toast weighs about 30-40 grams depending on thickness and bread type. Both slices together appear standard in thickness and typical slice size. Therefore, the combined weight of the two toast slices should be between about 60-80 grams. Given the visual evidence, I estimate the weight of the toast to be approximately 70 grams."

The mayonnaise is visible as a small dollop on the left side of the plate relative to other food items. It appears creamy and thick, with a volume roughly equivalent to about 1 to 1.5 tablespoons. A tablespoon of mayonnaise typically weighs about 14 grams. Given the size of this portion on the plate and comparing it to the size of the fork and other foods, the overall mayonnaise portion is slightly smaller than a full tablespoon but larger than half a tablespoon. Therefore, an estimated weight range would be about 10-15 grams. Taking the midpoint leads to an estimate of approximately 13 grams. This aligns well with typical Swiss portion sizes for a small serving of mayonnaise as a condiment, and the volume is consistent with what is visually present on the plate."

The target food is 'beurre' which is visible as a small pat on the plate near the toasted bread slices. The butter portion appears to be a typical serving amount often seen accompanying such meals, roughly a chunk about 3 cm long, 1.5 cm wide, and about 1 cm thick. Butter has a dense consistency, so even a small volume translates to a noticeable weight. This portion looks like a typical single serving of butter used for spreading on bread, likely between 15-25 grams. Given the size and thickness compared to common Swiss butter serving sizes, an estimate toward the midpoint of 20 grams makes sense. This also aligns well with the visible portion relative to other foods on the plate."

The food item 'graine de chia' (chia seeds) is visible mixed within the yogurt and oats in a glass jar. Chia seeds are small and dense but distributed sparsely in the mixture, visible as many tiny black seeds throughout the yogurt. Given the jar size (approximately 250 mL), the chia seeds are lightly but evenly mixed in and likely represent a small fraction of the total weight. Typically, chia seed servings used in such preparations are about 15-25 grams per portion. The visible amount appears consistent with this, neither too sparse nor overly thick. So, a plausible range would be 15-25 grams, with a midpoint estimate near 20 grams. This aligns reasonably with the container size, distribution, and typical usage in such a dish."

The target food item is 'pain' (bread). The image shows two slices of bread on a plate, each spread with different toppings (one with butter and molasses, the other with Nutella). The slices appear to be of regular homemade or artisanal bread, not very thick but not thin either. A typical slice of such bread usually weighs between 30 and 40 grams. Given these slices are of medium thickness and size, and considering their visible density and porous texture, each slice likely weighs around 35 grams. Since the food item is 'pain' and the image clearly shows 2 slices, the total weight for both slices would be around 70 grams. As the instruction is to estimate the weight of one 'pain' and bread slices are typically considered individually, I will estimate the weight of one slice of bread as approximately 35 grams."

The image shows a mostly empty white plate with one small remaining piece of pizza. The pizza slice appears to have a thick crust and some mushroom toppings along with tomato sauce and cheese. The size of the pizza piece looks roughly like a small quarter or smaller of a standard personal pizza slice, approximately 6-7 cm at the crust side and about 5 cm wide at the bottom. Considering the thickness of the crust and toppings, and estimating density, a whole medium personal pizza typically weighs around 250-300 grams. This piece appears to be about one-sixth to one-eighth of a full pizza slice, thus likely weighing between 40-50 grams. I will estimate the weight more precisely at 45 grams, which is near the midpoint of this plausible range and fits well with the size and thickness visible."

The 'biscuit' in the image is visible as broken pieces placed on top of the ice cream, with a light and crisp texture, possibly wafer-like or thin biscuit. The pieces collectively cover a small surface area and are relatively thin. Considering typical Swiss biscuit portion sizes for dessert toppings and the visual volume shown, the amount looks like roughly 15-25 grams. The rustic broken pieces suggest a smaller serving rather than an entire biscuit. I estimate the biscuit weight at about 20 grams, with a plausible range between 15 and 25 grams based on the visual evidence and portion context."

The hummous is located on the bottom left of the plate, appearing as a modest dollop roughly 4-5 cm across and a little thick, but not piled very high. It is comparable in size to the cottage cheese and olives nearby and sits next to a fried egg and two bread rolls, both of which provide scale. Given the spread and texture, the hummous portion seems roughly comparable to about 2 tablespoons. Typically, 1 tablespoon of hummous weighs around 15 grams, so this portion is likely around 30 grams. Considering some variation in density and visual volume, a reasonable range would be 25 to 35 grams. This fits well with the overall light portion of this dish, which includes multiple small servings rather than a large serving of hummous."

The sprouts (pousses de graines) are visible on the left-center portion of the bowl, scattered among the fresh spinach leaves and cherry tomatoes. The sprouts appear to be mung bean or similar sprouted seeds. Their volume is moderate but they are lightweight and airy. Considering the density and the overall small pile compared to the other components, I estimate the sprouts to weigh roughly between 30 and 50 grams. Taking the midpoint, a reasonable estimate is about 40 grams."

Visually, there are about seven medium-sized raspberries arranged next to the strawberries and the slice of bread with Nutella. Each raspberry typically weighs between 3 and 5 grams depending on size. These raspberries appear plump and of average size. Taking an average weight of about 4 grams per raspberry, and counting seven raspberries, the total estimated weight would be around 28 grams. Considering a plausible range of roughly 25-30 grams for this portion, 28 grams is a reasonable mid-point estimate. This weight aligns well with the size comparison to the strawberries and the slice of bread on the same plate."

The image shows a white bowl containing a creamy mixture with visible chia seeds ('graines de chia') distributed throughout. The chia seeds are small and blackish, visible on the surface and mixed through the white creamy base (likely the 'blanc battu'). Given the density and the small size of chia seeds, the portion visible seems to be moderate, covering a good part of the bowl's inner surface but not deeply piled. A typical serving of chia seeds added to such a mixture ranges generally around 15-25 grams as they are often used in small quantities due to their high density and calorie content. Considering the observed quantity, which looks like a thin layer mixed roughly evenly, I estimate the weight of the chia seeds in this bowl to be about 18 grams. This falls within a plausible range of 15-22 grams based on the volume and distribution."

The image shows two fried eggs ('oeufs') placed on a bed of mixed cooked pasta. The eggs cover a large portion on top of the pasta. A typical large fried egg weighs about 50 grams. Given the visible size and typical thickness of the eggs, it looks like two standard fried eggs are present. Therefore, the total weight of the eggs should be close to 100 grams. Considering that they appear fully cooked and intact with some slight yolk rupture, an estimated plausible range would be 90-110 grams, with a midpoint estimate of 100 grams. This aligns well with typical Swiss portion sizes for eggs served as part of a meal and fits the visible portion size well."

The sauce vinaigrette in the image appears to be lightly drizzled over parts of the tofu à la mangue and scattered slightly on the other elements, like the carrot râpées and possibly the quinoa. The vinaigrette is not visible as a separate volume or container but rather as a thin coating or small pools here and there. Given the typical use of vinaigrette as a dressing, with a light application rather than a large quantity, the amount present is likely below 30 grams. Based on the size of the metal container, the visible amount of liquid vinaigrette scattered and absorbed in the ingredients suggests a range of about 10 to 25 grams might be plausible. Taking the midpoint and considering the light appearance, a final estimate of approximately 18 grams is reasonable. This fits well with Swiss portion use of vinaigrette as a condiment rather than a standalone food quantity."

The image shows a bowl containing fresh spinach leaves ('épinards frais') along with cherry tomatoes, sprouts, and falafels. The spinach leaves appear fresh, bright, and not densely packed, covering roughly half of the bowl with some leaves overlapping. Fresh spinach leaves are lightweight, with typical Swiss serving sizes of cooked spinach around 200-300g, but fresh spinach weighs less for the same volume due to air and leaf structure. Given the volume seen here, and that fresh spinach shrinks a lot when cooked, this salad portion would likely be about 50-70 grams of fresh spinach. Considering visual fullness and the relative size compared to falafels and tomatoes, I estimate the fresh spinach weight to be about 60 grams, with a plausible range between 50 and 70 grams."

The butter appears to be thinly spread on each slice, covering most of the surface but not piled up thickly. For two slices of bread of this size, a typical thin spread of butter would be approximately 5 to 8 grams per slice, so combined around 10 to 16 grams. Since the picture shows a moderate but not thick butter layer, I estimate the total butter on both pieces combined is around 13 grams. Since the food item is just 'beurre' (butter), and the estimate focuses on these two slices, I assign 13 grams as a reasonable estimate, reflecting typical portion and visible coverage."

Considering the size of these four drumsticks, which appear lean and cooked with some charring, and comparing them to the nearby salad and bread slices, the total mass of the chicken seems moderate but not excessive. Each drumstick likely weighs around 25-35 grams after cooking, leading to a total plausible weight range of 100-140 grams. Choosing a midpoint that fits the visible volume and density, I estimate the weight of the four chicken drumsticks to be approximately 120 grams."

The molasses is the light brown spread visible on the upper slice. The slices appear to be artisan-style bread, somewhat thick, and typical size. The layer of molasses is thin and spread unevenly, covering much of the upper slice surface but not heavily piled. Given molasses' high density but the thin spread present, the amount is small. Considering the typical spoonful used as a spread and the visible coverage, the molasses amount looks to be around 10-15 grams. A range of 8-18 grams seems plausible, with the midpoint at about 13 grams. This estimate aligns with a normal serving size of molasses spread on a slice of bread for breakfast."

The image shows two slices of bread on a plate. One slice is spread with butter ('beurre') and molasses, and the other slice has Nutella. The target food is the 'beurre', visible on the top slice. The butter is spread relatively thinly but covers a significant portion of the bread slice. Considering a typical slice of bread weighs about 30-40g, the butter layer appears moderate and likely weighs around 10-15g. Butter is dense, so a thin but even spread like this roughly corresponds to about 12 grams. Based on visual assessment, the butter is not very thick but more than a thin smear, so I estimate a weight of approximately 12 grams. A reasonable range might be between 10 and 15 grams, with 12g as a good midpoint estimate."

The egg ('oeuf') is visible on the right side of the plate, cut in half, showing a firm white and a slightly soft yolk. A typical medium-sized boiled egg in Switzerland weighs approximately 50 grams in shell. Without the shell, the edible portion is around 45 grams. Given that only half the egg is visible but the cut half is clearly placed, we can estimate the total visible edible egg portion on the plate corresponds roughly to one half of a boiled egg. Therefore, the visible egg weight is about 22 to 25 grams. The egg is clearly present and occupies a small portion compared to the rest of the food items on the plate. Considering this and the relative portion sizes of other components, it is plausible to estimate the egg weight at about 23 grams, which lies comfortably between 20-25 grams range for half an egg."

The muesli nature is presented in a small bowl on the right side of the image. It appears as clustered granola-like chunks rather than loose flakes, occupying the bowl above the rim but not heaping excessively. Considering the size of the bowl relative to the adjacent dish of yogurt and the wooden table surface as context, the volume of muesli is moderate. Typically, a portion of dry muesli in such a bowl would be expected to weigh less than 100 grams, given its low density and air gaps in the clusters. A reasonable range would be about 50 to 90 grams, with the clusters suggesting a denser than average loose muesli but still relatively light. Given the appearance and typical portion sizes, I estimate the weight of the muesli nature here to be about 70 grams."
ppf8hc,parmesan,14.0,20.0,6.0,0.010189228529839884,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/2833b10a-52c7-409b-ad86-f6147c323f9e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The parmesan in the image appears as a fine sprinkling mixed into the risotto or as a light coating. It is not presented as large chunks or a separate pile, but rather integrated into the rice and asparagus mixture. Typically, grated parmesan used as a topping or mixed into a dish like risotto ranges between 10 to 30 grams for typical portions. Given the moderate amount visible — enough to noticeably coat the risotto but not heavily layered — a plausible internal range would be around 15-25 grams. Choosing a value near the midpoint to reflect the visible distribution and typical usage, I estimate the parmesan weight to be approximately 20 grams. This estimate aligns well with Swiss portion norms for cheese as an accompaniment or garnish without overestimating the cheese amount relative to the risotto portion on the plate."

The gaufre (waffle) is visible on a plate with a layer of apple compote on top. The waffle appears to be a single rectangular piece, about the size of a typical home-made or store-bought waffle roughly 10x13 cm. Waffles are generally light but denser than airy foods. A typical Swiss serving size for a single waffle of this size is around 45-60 grams. Given the thickness visible and that this is a single piece, the weight should be near the middle of that range. The apple compote on top does not affect the waffle weight, so it is excluded from this estimation. Based on the visual evidence and calibration, the waffle weight is about 53 grams."

The œuf dur (hard boiled egg) is clearly visible on the left side of the plate, cut in half. A typical whole hard boiled egg weighs between 50-60 grams. The two halves shown correspond to one full egg. Considering the size relative to the other foods and the fork/knife nearby for scale, this egg looks like a standard medium-sized egg without shell. Therefore, the estimated weight is approximately 55 grams, which fits within the plausible range of 50-60 grams for one boiled egg."

The image shows a slice of tresse bread on a plate with a spread of butter and apricot jam. The specified item to estimate is the butter. The butter portion is thinly spread beneath the jam layer and covers most of the top surface of the bread slice. Given the thickness and coverage, this looks like a single thin spreading layer rather than a pat or thick dollop, which would typically weigh more. A thin spread of butter on a slice of bread usually weighs around 5 to 10 grams. Considering the visible coverage is quite light and not overly thick, I estimate the butter weight to be about 7 grams. This fits plausibly with the visual cues and typical portion sizes for spread butter on a slice of bread."

The image shows a white square plate with several raviolis a la courge (pumpkin ravioli) placed in the top left quadrant. There are about eight raviolis visible, each medium-sized, typical for filled pasta, and lightly seasoned with black pepper. Considering their size relative to the cherry tomatoes and shredded iceberg lettuce also on the plate, each ravioli appears to be roughly 15-20 grams. Therefore, the total weight of the ravioli portion is estimated between 120 and 160 grams. Since this appears to be a moderate serving on a plate with side salad components, the mid-point estimate around 140 grams is reasonable. This fits well with Swiss portion guidelines for pasta dishes and matches the visible quantity and size in the image."

The image shows a meal tray with four food items: grilled chicken, green beans (haricots verts), pasta (pâtes) with tomato sauce, and grated Parmesan cheese. The target food item is the pasta. The pasta is clearly visible on the right side of the tray, underneath a noticeable layer of Parmesan cheese. The pasta portion fills roughly half the right side of the container, appearing to be a moderate serving size. The pasta shown are cooked fusilli, and from the Swiss portion reference, a typical cooked pasta serving weighs about 180-250g, but cooked pasta often weighs closer to 120-150g per serving in practice. Given this is not a large volume of pasta and it is only partially covering one side of the container, I estimate the portion to be slightly below a full serving. The Parmesan cheese adds visual bulk but little weight. Considering the depth of the pasta layer and the visible area, I estimate the pasta weight to be between 130g and 160g. Taking the midpoint, a reasonable estimate is about 145g. This weight fits the visual portion size and the container size relative to the other foods, and aligns with typical Swiss portion sizes for pasta servings."

The target food is 'pain,' visible as one thick slice of bread on a white plate. The slice is roughly circular with a diameter close to that of a small sandwich bun or rustic bread roll slice. Typical slice thickness and density indicate a weight roughly between 30 and 50 grams for this kind of bread slice. The portion covers a moderate plate area, not very thick or dense, so a midpoint estimate around 40 grams is reasonable. The butter and pâte à tartiner are thin layers on the bread surface and do not contribute to the bread's weight. Considering Swiss portion sizes for bread slices, this estimate is consistent and plausible."

The image shows a small portion of hazelnut ice cream ('glace noisette') served in a small bowl. The single scoop is about the size of a typical ice cream serving but slightly irregular and dense in appearance. Judging by the bowl size and the volume of ice cream, it appears to be roughly half a standard scoop. A regular scoop of ice cream is usually around 90-100 grams, so this portion looks closer to 45-55 grams. Considering some slight compaction and texture, I estimate the weight of this hazelnut ice cream to be approximately 50 grams. This range (45-55g) is plausible given the visual volume and density of the ice cream in the bowl."

The specified food item is 'yaourt nature'. In the image, the plain yogurt is in a small plastic container typical of individual yogurt servings found in Switzerland. Such containers usually hold between 100 to 125 grams of yogurt. The yogurt appears full, with a smooth surface and no visible missing portion. Comparing the size of the container to the nearby apple, which looks like a small-to-medium apple (~150 grams), supports this volume estimation. Considering standard Swiss yogurt pot sizes and the visual fullness, an estimated weight of about 120 grams is reasonable. The plausible weight range would be approximately 100-130 grams, with the final estimate near the midpoint at 120 grams."

The carrots are visible in the bowl mixed with other ingredients: noodles, eggplant slices, and some melted Gruyère cheese. The carrot slices appear thin and are cut mostly into small strips and one larger slice visible on the right side of the bowl. The quantity of carrots is moderate but not abundant compared to the noodles. Carrots are dense but the portion here looks like a few thin strips plus one slice, making it a small to medium portion. Given the area they occupy and typical carrot density, an estimated plausible range for carrots here would be around 30 to 50 grams. Considering the observed amount, a midpoint estimate of approximately 40 grams is reasonable and consistent with the portion size seen in the bowl relative to the other food items."

The 'huile de lin' (linseed oil) is a liquid and appears to be used as a drizzle or small added quantity on the dish, as no visible bottle or separate container is shown. Typically, linseed oil is used in small amounts for flavor or dressing, often around 5-15 grams per serving. Given the visual evidence and the context of the other items on the plate, the amount of linseed oil is likely minimal. The oil would weigh less than a tablespoon if just drizzled or lightly added as a condiment. Therefore, a plausible weight range for the linseed oil on this plate is approximately 5-15 grams, with a midpoint estimate of 10 grams. This is consistent with typical culinary use and portion size for such oils in a salad or vegetable dish."

The mozzarella is located as a dollop on top of the cooked spiral pasta at the bottom center of the plate. It appears to be a soft, creamy type of mozzarella (likely a small portion of fresh mozzarella or a similar creamy variant). Visually, the portion is roughly the size of a heaping tablespoon or slightly more, covering only a small area compared to the pasta and other components. Given the typical density and size of such a dollop, it looks to weigh between 40 and 70 grams. Considering the visible volume and comparing it to typical Swiss portion sizes for mozzarella—which often range from 30 to 100 grams depending on the use and dish—the most reasonable estimate for this moderate dollop of mozzarella is about 55 grams."

The image shows a small piece of a demi croissant with some butter and apricot jam spread on it. This is clearly a partial piece of a half croissant rather than a whole half. Given that a typical demi croissant weighs about 40-50 grams, and considering that this piece is roughly about one third to half of a demi croissant portion, the weight visible is much smaller. The crumbs and the size relative to the plate indicate a small bite-sized portion. Therefore, a plausible weight range for this piece is about 12-18 grams. Choosing a value near the midpoint gives an estimated weight of approximately 15 grams, which accounts for both the bread and the spread on top while staying realistic for the visible size."

The cooked épautre (spelt) is located in the left portion of the glass container. It appears as a dense grain, filling about one third of the rectangular container. Considering the container size is roughly the size of a standard meal prep box, and comparing the épautre grains to the scrambled eggs and roasted aubergine beside it, the volume looks substantial but not overly piled. Cooked spelt is similar in density and weight to cooked wheat or barley grains. Swiss portion for cooked grains like rice or spelt is typically 150-180g. Here, the portion fills roughly one third of a moderately sized meal container, so a range of 140-180g seems plausible. To avoid under or overestimation, I'll set a weight midpoint slightly below the typical starch portion, respecting visual cues. Thus, an estimate near 160 grams is reasonable and consistent with the visible quantity."
