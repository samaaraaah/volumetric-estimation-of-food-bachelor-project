p8a2w5,pillons de poulet,112.0,450.0,338.0,4.803451338662606,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/bdb25c53-2eb7-4a81-b33e-6d28997d0183,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The pilons de poulet (chicken drumsticks) are positioned prominently on the plate, with five pieces visible. Each drumstick appears medium-sized, with visible seasoning and grilling marks. Typically, a cooked chicken drumstick weighs between 80-110 grams depending on size and cooking loss. These look fairly average in size, not overly large or small. Considering five pieces, I estimate each at about 90 grams on average. That yields a total weight range around 400-500 grams overall. More precisely, I place the estimate near the midpoint at 450 grams for the five drumsticks total. This is consistent with the relative volume on the plate compared to the bread and salad portions, and reasonable for cooked chicken drumsticks of this size."
wrah5h,pâtes,148.0,375.0,227.0,4.262910798122066,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/115dbd14-27ca-4200-a232-fa9f3eb9bad7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a metal lunch container divided roughly into two parts. On the right side, there is a portion of cooked fusilli pasta with tomato sauce, topped with a visible amount of grated parmesan. The pasta portion fills about half the container's volume. The pasta appears moderately packed, with some space visible between spirals near the edges. Considering the container size relative to the finger visible at the bottom and standard lunchbox dimensions, the length of the container is approximately 18-20 cm, and the pasta occupies about 9x12 cm footprint with a shallow depth of about 3 cm. Cooked pasta has a density roughly 110-130 g per 100 ml (or ml equivalent to volume). Estimating the pasta volume to be around 300-350 ml, this gives an approximate weight of 330-450 grams. Given the medium density and visible compactness, a plausible range would be 330–420 grams, selecting a midpoint of 375 grams for the pasta portion. This estimate does not include the parmesan weight, as it is separately annotated and not requested here. The portion size is reasonable for a single meal serving and consistent with the other food portions visible."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,205.0,212.0,11.217358203273696,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with a tomato salad ('salade de tomates'). The tomatoes are cut into wedges and slices, covering the plate surface well but not piled high, indicating roughly one medium tomato or slightly more. The plate size, compared to the knife and fork next to it, suggests a medium dinner plate approximately 25 cm in diameter. The tomato pieces seem moderately thick and juicy, typical for fresh tomatoes. Considering the density of tomatoes (about 0.9 g/cm3) and the visible volume, the total tomato weight looks to be in a range between 180 to 230 grams. The presence of dressing and flax seeds adds minimal weight and should not be included in the estimate. Midpoint-based estimation leads me to about 205 grams as a reasonable weight for the tomato portion presented."

The salade grecque is contained in a rectangular plastic container that is about the size of a typical lunchbox container—roughly 15 cm long, 10 cm wide, and about 8 cm deep. The salad fills around half to two-thirds of the container, with visible chopped pieces of cucumber, tomato, yellow bell pepper, onion rings, olives, and pieces of feta cheese mixed in. Greek salad ingredients are mostly vegetables with relatively low density, but the presence of olives and feta increases the overall density moderately. Given the container size and the partial fill, the volume of salad is about 800 ml or less. Estimating density around 0.6 to 0.75 g/ml considering vegetables and cheese, the salad weight likely ranges between 450 and 600 grams. Choosing a midpoint close to the visual fullness and density, I estimate the salade grecque in the container to weigh approximately 520 grams."

The image shows a small cardboard container filled with cherry tomatoes (tomates cerises) on the vine. There are approximately 18-20 cherry tomatoes visible, clustered closely together. A typical cherry tomato weighs about 15-20 grams depending on size. These tomatoes appear medium-sized, so we can estimate about 17 grams each. Multiplying by about 19 tomatoes gives a weight range between 285 and 340 grams. Considering the fullness and the size of the container relative to the tomatoes, a reasonable final estimate is near the midpoint, about 312 grams. This range reflects the density and typical weight of each tomato combined with the visible count in the packaging."

The image shows a small bowl filled with fresh blueberries (myrtilles), held in one hand. The blueberries are roughly uniform in size, relatively round and plump, filling the bowl almost to the brim. The bowl looks to be about 8 to 10 cm in diameter, typical for a small dessert bowl. Given the density and average weight of fresh blueberries, which is about 0.5 grams per blueberry, and considering the bowl appears to hold around 60-70 blueberries, the total visible portion is likely between 30 and 40 grams. Accounting for some variation in blueberry size and bowl depth, a reasonable estimate is approximately 35 grams."

The courgette et oignons (zucchini and onions) are located on the left side of the glass container. The vegetables appear chopped into medium-sized pieces, cooked, and somewhat moist. The portion fills about half of the container's left half, which is a square glass container approximately 13 cm wide. Judging by the size of the container compared to the food, the volume of zucchini and onions is roughly equivalent to about one cup of cooked vegetables. Considering that cooked zucchini and onions have a medium water content and are moderately dense, a typical density would be around 150-170 grams per cup. Given the volume and the visible portion, I estimate the weight range between 140 grams (minimum) and 180 grams (maximum). Taking the midpoint, the best estimate is approximately 160 grams for the courgette et oignons portion."

The image shows peeled and sliced raw kohlrabi ('colrave crue') pieces placed on a white plastic tray lid. The pieces are relatively thick and the total volume appears to cover almost the entire tray surface, stacked one layer thick. Given the density of raw kohlrabi, which is a crunchy vegetable with similar density to raw turnip or cabbage, the estimated density is medium, roughly 0.7 to 0.8 grams per cubic centimeter. Using the approximate surface area of the tray lid as around 20cm by 12cm and a thickness of about 1.5cm average for the pieces, the total volume is around 360 cubic centimeters. Multiplying this volume by the density estimate (0.75g/cm³) gives approximately 270 grams as an upper bound. Considering some gaps and air between pieces, a realistic weight range would be 230 to 270 grams. I place my estimate near the mid-to-high point at 255 grams to account for the visible fullness and thickness."

The croissants au jambon are located on the left side of the plate, clearly visible as two small croissants. They appear to be slightly dense due to the ham filling inside, which adds some weight. Each croissant is roughly the size of a small palm and looks well-baked but not overly large. Given the average weight of a ham croissant of this size is around 70-90 grams each, and there are two croissants on the plate, the total weight of the two combined would be approximately between 140 and 180 grams. Picking a midpoint value, an estimate of about 160 grams is reasonable and fits well with the portion size and visual density."

The galettes millet haricots noirs maïs are located on the right-center part of the bowl, consisting of three fairly thick patties with visible corn kernels and black beans mixed with millet. Each galette is roughly the size of a palm and appears quite dense due to the combination of grains and legumes. Considering the visual thickness and approximate size relative to the hand holding the bowl and the surrounding foods (green salad leaves, mushrooms, and beet purée), each galette likely weighs between 90 and 120 grams. Three galettes together would thus weigh about 270 to 360 grams. Choosing a value near the midpoint for precision, I estimate the total weight of the galettes millet haricots noirs maïs to be approximately 315 grams."

The specified food item is 'viande' (meat), which is located on the bottom left part of the plate. It appears as a cooked ground meat portion, roughly oblong in shape and about the size of a medium adult palm. Comparing it with the potatoes (which look like small boiled fingerling potatoes) and the large leaves of lettuce, the meat portion looks moderately thick and dense. Ground meat is generally dense, roughly 250-300 grams per typical palm-sized portion. Given the size and the visible thickness, I estimate the meat's weight in a range of 130-180 grams. Choosing a midpoint that fits the visible size and density, I finalize at approximately 155 grams. This respects the portion size visually and the relative scale compared to the potatoes and salad on the plate."

The specified food item is 'légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)'. These are visible on the right side of the plate, consisting of cooked carrots and leeks cut into medium pieces. The portion takes up roughly a quarter of the plate surface. The vegetables appear soft and sautéed, thus a bit compacted, but they are not densely packed as a puree would be. The plate itself is a standard small dinner plate of about 22-24 cm diameter, so the vegetable portion size is approximately 8-10 cm in width and 3-4 cm in height when considering volume. Considering the density of cooked carrots and leeks (medium density, about 0.9 g/cm³), and the approximate volume visually assessed, the portion likely weighs between 90 and 130 grams. Estimating near the mid-point, the weight for these sautéed vegetables is about 110 grams. This fits visually as the vegetables occupy a moderate portion of the plate and have reasonable thickness and volume for that weight."

The carrots are sliced into thick rounds and arranged on the plate on the left. The plate is a standard dinner plate (about 26 cm diameter) which helps scale the size. The carrot slices are roughly 1.5 to 2 cm thick and about 4 to 5 cm in diameter. There are about 12 pieces visible, and the total volume corresponds to roughly half a medium carrot. Fresh carrots typically weigh about 60-70 grams per 100 ml volume, and given the visible portion, the total carrot weight looks like it could range roughly between 90 and 120 grams. Taking the midpoint of this range for a balanced estimate, the carrot portion weighs approximately 105 grams."

The galettes millet haricots noirs maïs are located on the right side of the glass container. There are five small, thick patties packed closely together. They include visible corn kernels and black beans embedded in a millet base, which gives a moderately dense texture. Comparing the galettes to the glass container size (roughly 15x15 cm) and the left portion of cooked courgettes and onions, each galette seems about 5-6 cm wide and 1.5-2 cm thick. Considering density (grain and beans are dense foods), a small patty of this size can weigh approximately 40-50 grams each. With five galettes present, the total weight should be between 200 and 250 grams. Placing the estimate near the midpoint, I approximate the total weight of the galettes millet haricots noirs maïs at about 225 grams."

The spaghetti is presented on a medium-sized flat plate with a visible pile of cooked noodles. The spaghetti pile appears moderately dense and occupies most of the plate's center. Given the typical density of cooked spaghetti (about 140 grams per cup or 150-160 grams for a medium serving) and comparing the portion to the size of the black plate, the spaghetti looks like a moderate single portion, roughly equivalent to about 1 to 1.25 cups of cooked pasta. Small pieces of grated gruyère scattered on top do not add significant bulk to the spaghetti itself. Considering these factors, an estimated range would be around 130-170 grams of cooked spaghetti. A reasonable midpoint estimate consistent with the visual cues is approximately 150 grams."

The image shows a plate with a small remaining portion of pasta salad (salade de pâtes). The pasta pieces are medium-sized penne, and there are visible small bits of vegetables such as corn and cherry tomatoes, along with some herbs. The portion is sparse, covering a small area in the middle of the plate, roughly equivalent to about 10-12 pieces of penne pasta. Considering cooked pasta density (approximately 130 grams per cup cooked) and the volume visible, this partial portion looks like about 40-50 grams of pasta salad. The presence of vegetables adds a small amount of weight but not significantly. Taking all of this into account, a plausible weight range is 35-55 grams, and the midpoint estimate is about 45 grams."

The salade de pâtes is visible at the bottom left of the plate. It consists of spiral pasta pieces with visible vegetable bits like corn and tomato. The portion covers roughly a quarter of the plate and has a moderate volume, appearing loosely packed but dense since the pasta is cooked. Considering the plate diameter (standard dinner plate size ~26 cm) and the volume occupied, the pasta salad likely weighs more than a light salad but less than a dense main dish. A reasonable estimate for this portion of pasta salad is between 120 and 160 grams. Picking a value near the midpoint, I estimate the salade de pâtes to weigh approximately 140 grams."

The image shows a small green bowl containing three fairly large strawberries (fraises). The strawberries appear ripe and whole with their green stems still attached. Comparing the size of the strawberries to the bowl and the wooden table, each strawberry seems quite sizable, likely larger than average. Typically, a medium strawberry weighs around 12-18 grams, but these look bigger than average. Estimating each strawberry at about 25-30 grams, given their bulk and volume, the total weight for the three strawberries together would be in the range of 75 to 90 grams. Choosing a value near the midpoint, I estimate the combined weight of the strawberries to be approximately 82 grams."

The slice takes up a moderate portion of the plate, typical for a dessert serving. The crust is relatively thin, and the rhubarb pieces on top are chunky but not overly dense. The overall volume of the slice seems modest, and considering the density of rhubarb (mostly water) and a light custard or batter beneath, the tart slice is not very dense. The fork and knife are standard size, giving context that the slice is about 12-15 cm in longest length. Based on these observations and typical Swiss tart portion sizes, the weight is likely in the 140-180 gram range. A midpoint estimate of around 160 grams seems reasonable given the visible size and density."

Cooked brown rice is dense and moist, with an average density of about 130-140 grams per cooked cup (about 200-220 grams per 250 ml volume). Comparing the rice pile to the size of the salmon pieces and the shredded carrot and corn salad gives a good reference: the rice mound is moderately sized, appearing to be about one standard serving. Given the visible volume and density, I estimate the rice weighs approximately between 120 grams and 150 grams.

The poivron (red bell pepper) pieces are visible in the center-left area of the plate, cut into strips. They appear cooked or sautéed, which slightly reduces their volume compared to raw. The portion looks moderate, roughly a quarter of a medium-sized red bell pepper. Considering a raw medium red bell pepper weighs about 150-160 grams, the cooked and slightly reduced volume portion corresponds to approximately 80-100 grams. Comparing this portion size to the adjacent items, the poivron strips take a moderate area on the plate without being piled up. Therefore, estimating the poivron weight at around 90 grams is reasonable, reflecting a midpoint weight for this observed cooked pepper portion."

The mozzarella is the white creamy portion placed on top of the pasta in the center of the plate. It appears to be a dollop of soft mozzarella or similar fresh cheese. Given the size relative to the pasta and beans, and considering the typical density of fresh mozzarella (which is moist but dense), it looks like about a medium-sized serving. The volume looks comparable to roughly a small个 ball of fresh mozzarella or about 90-110 grams. A reasonable minimum-maximum weight range based on the visual bulk and texture would be 80 to 120 grams. Choosing the midpoint, I estimate the weight of the mozzarella portion to be approximately 100 grams."

The salade is located on the upper right part of the plate. It appears to be a small portion of leafy greens with some visible bits of other vegetables or seeds. The size of the salad is relatively small compared to the risotto portion and the overall plate size. Leafy salads have low density and weight per volume. The salad looks like roughly a small handful, loosely packed, approximately 50-70 grams by volume. Considering the salad's loose nature and visible content, the estimated weight lies near the middle of this range, at about 60 grams."

The image shows a slice of strawberry tart (tarte aux fraises) on a small dessert plate. The tart slice includes a visible crust, a creamy filling, and several whole and halved strawberries on top, with some red currants as well. The plate pattern and spoon in the background give scale; the plate diameter is likely around 20-22 cm, making the slice length about 10 cm and width about 5-6 cm on its widest part. The crust appears thin but crumbly, the filling is moderately thick, and the strawberries are dense and fresh. Considering the slice thickness and volume of fruit and cream, the portion likely weighs between 100 and 140 grams. Given this range, a midpoint estimate of 120 grams seems reasonable for this slice."

The image shows one rectangular waffle (gaufre) on a standard-sized decorative plate, approximately 12 cm by 8 cm in visible dimensions. The waffle looks cooked and fairly thick, about 1.5 to 2 cm high. Waffles of this size typically weigh between 70 and 110 grams depending on density and recipe. Given it is a homemade style waffle with air pockets visible, it is likely on the lighter side of that range but still substantial. Considering the size relative to the plate and the noted thickness, a reasonable weight range is 80 to 100 grams. Midpoint around 90 grams is a consistent, plausible estimate for the waffle’s weight here."

The salade de céleri is the pile of creamy white shredded celery root located at the bottom right of the plate. Considering the size of the plate and comparing it with the other foods, the portion is moderate, roughly occupying a quarter of the plate space. The celery root is shredded and lightly creamy, which makes it medium density. Visually, the portion looks to be about the size of a small fist. Given that shredded celery root is fairly dense but lighter than cooked meat or potatoes, a reasonable weight range would be between 70 and 110 grams. Choosing a midpoint value considering the volume and density, the estimate for the salade de céleri is approximately 90 grams. This is plausible relative to the other items and the plate size."

The specified food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries), which are mixed into a bowl with cereal and an orange blood yogurt. Visually, the blueberries are dispersed throughout the mixture but remain distinguishable by their round shape and dark blue color. The bowl is moderately filled, with a significant portion of the content being the yogurt and cereal mix. Considering the volume occupied by visible blueberries and accounting for some covered by yogurt and cereal, the total mass of the blueberries can be approximated. Blueberries are relatively dense and small, each around 1-2 grams. Based on the visible clusters and density, an estimated range would be between 40 and 70 grams of blueberries. Choosing a midpoint close to 55 grams seems reasonable and consistent with the portion size and the total bowl content."

The salami is located on the right side of the plate. The portion consists of approximately 5 slices of salami, some of which are whole and others are broken. Each slice appears to be thinly cut and roughly 2-3 cm in diameter. Given that salami is dense and fatty, each slice typically weighs around 10-15 grams. Considering the visible volume of slices, the total weight of the salami portion is estimated between 45-60 grams. Midpoint estimation leads to about 53 grams for the salami, which aligns well with the visible quantity and density."

The food item 'maréchal' appears to be small cubes of cheese on the plate. There are about six small cubes visible, each roughly around 2 cm by 2 cm by 1.5 cm in size. Cheese typically has a density around 1.0 g/cm³, so each cube weighing approximately 8-10 grams is plausible. The total visible cheese volume suggests a weight range between 45 and 60 grams. Taking the midpoint for precision and given the visual fullness of the cubes, I estimate the weight of the 'maréchal' cheese to be about 52 grams."

The scrambled eggs (oeufs brouillés) are positioned on the top left of the plate and cover a moderate area. The eggs are somewhat fluffy but dense due to cooking. The portion appears to be about a standard single serving of scrambled eggs made from roughly 2 large eggs. Considering one large egg weighs about 50 grams raw, and cooking removes some water but adds oil/fat, the final cooked portion typically weighs slightly less than the raw weight. Visually, the quantity fits well with around 100-120 grams of scrambled eggs. The shape and volume compared to the gnocchi and cauliflower on the plate—which are moderate portions—support this estimate. Thus, an estimated weight of 110 grams is reasonable and consistent with the visible portion size and typical density."

The image shows three slices of bread (pain) on a plate. Each slice appears to be from a dense, rustic bread loaf, roughly medium thickness, and similar in size to typical Swiss homemade or bakery bread. The slices have a rough, irregular shape, suggesting artisanal style bread with a thick crust. The slices cover a moderate area on the plate, which helps gauge their approximate size. Given the density and size, a typical slice of such bread weighs between 40 to 55 grams. These slices appear to be on the larger side and thicker, so estimating near the higher end makes sense. Considering the breed and visible size, the total weight of one slice of this bread is likely around 50 grams. The range can be reasonably 45-55 grams per slice, and 50 grams is a balanced midpoint estimate."

The specified food item is 'pâtes,' which are the spiral shaped pasta on the plate. They occupy the largest portion of the plate, positioned at the front center. The pasta portion looks moderately thick and dense, with a smooth texture indicating cooked pasta. The plate is a standard size, and the pasta covers about one third of it, forming a roughly 10-12 cm wide pile with medium height. The quantity visually corresponds to a typical cooked pasta portion just before or slightly less than a full serving. Given cooked pasta density is around 130-160 grams per cooked cup, this looks like roughly 1 to 1.25 cups. Estimating a range from 130 grams on the lower end to 180 grams on the higher end seems reasonable. Selecting a midpoint, the estimated weight of the pasta on this plate is around 155 grams. This aligns well with overall plate fullness and visual bulk."

The image shows two pieces of bread ('pain') on a white plate. Each piece appears to be a slice of rustic or artisan bread with an open crumb structure, moderate thickness, and a crust around the edge. The slices are about half of an average-sized bread slice, judging by the size of the knife and plate. Typical sliced bread weighs around 30-40 grams per full slice, but rustic bread can be denser and heavier. Since these are halves, each piece is likely around 25-30 grams. Together, the two pieces would weigh approximately 50-60 grams. I estimate the total weight of the bread present in the image to be around 55 grams, sitting near the midpoint of this range."

The tartine with mélasse and butter is the lower slice of bread on the plate. It is a medium-sized slice of rustic bread with a light, uneven spread of butter and a visible layer of mélasse on top. The bread slice itself appears to weigh about 50-60 grams based on size and thickness typical for this type of rustic bread. The butter applied is thin but covers much of the slice, which amounts to roughly 10 grams. The layer of mélasse appears to be lightly drizzled, covering about half the surface with a thin layer—around 5 grams of mélasse. Since the question targets the combined mélasse and butter on the tartine, the spread portion weight including butter and mélasse would be around 15 grams, but the tartine is broader than just the spread. However, the input specifies to estimate for 'tartine mélasse + beurre', which includes bread plus spreads. Combining the bread slice (approximately 55 grams) and the spread layers (about 15 grams total), the estimated total weight for this tartine is around 70 grams. A plausible range would be 65 to 75 grams, and 70 grams is a solid midpoint estimate. This fits well with the visible size compared to the plate and the other tartine on top."

The image shows a plate with Vaya bean chips, which are thin, crisp, and relatively light snacks. The chips are spread in a moderate pile, covering about half the inner surface of the plate, which is a standard-sized dinner plate (about 25 cm diameter). Vaya bean chips are typically quite light and airy, with a density less than a regular potato chip. Given the volume and the loose stacking, the total visible portion is roughly equivalent to a small to medium snack serving. Considering their thinness and lightness, a reasonable weight range is approximately 25 to 40 grams. Positioned near the midpoint, I estimate about 32 grams for the visible portion on the plate."

The galette millet maïs haricots noirs is located in the center of the container, below the salad of shredded beetroot and carrot. There are two small galettes visible, roughly 5-6 cm in diameter each. Judging by their thickness and density, given that millet, corn, and black beans are dense ingredients, the galettes appear compact and firm. Each galette seems to weigh between 50-60 grams based on typical density and volume estimation. Together, the two galettes would weigh around 100-120 grams. Considering some uncertainty in compactness and size, a middle value of approximately 110 grams is reasonable and consistent with the size relative to the container and other food items."

The 'salade verte' is located on the bottom right part of the plate and consists mainly of leafy greens lightly coated in dressing. The portion covers a small section of the plate, roughly equivalent to a small handful of lettuce leaves, which are lightweight and low density. Compared to the other denser items on the plate like the 'rôti' and 'salade de riz', the volume is moderate but the weight is relatively low due to high water content in the lettuce. Typical leafy green salads of this volume usually weigh between 40 and 60 grams. Given the visible amount, I estimate the salad weighs about 50 grams, nicely centered in the plausible range."

The fresh spinach ('épinards frais') is visible as the large green leaves forming the base layer of the dish plate. The spinach leaves cover nearly the entire bowl, with some parts partially overlapped by cherry tomatoes, sprouted seeds, and falafels. Fresh spinach leaves are fairly light but have some density due to their fleshy texture. Considering the bowl is medium-sized and the spinach layer is reasonably full but not tightly packed, the total weight of these fresh spinach leaves can be estimated. Typical fresh spinach leaves weigh roughly 30-40 grams per handful, and here we can see about 2 to 2.5 handfuls worth. Given this, the plausible weight range is about 60-100 grams, and placing an estimate near the midpoint, I estimate the fresh spinach weight at approximately 80 grams. This accounts for the visible volume and leaf density, matching the visual context without overestimating."

The muesli nature is in a small brown bowl next to the yaourt nature. The bowl is nearly full with chunky clusters of muesli. Considering the typical density of dry muesli, which is relatively light but compact in clusters, and using the bowl size (which appears to be about the size of a small dessert bowl, roughly 10 cm diameter), the portion looks like it could weigh between 30 and 50 grams. Given the fullness and cluster density, a reasonable estimate would be near the mid-point of this range, about 40 grams. This aligns with standard serving sizes for muesli portions served alongside yogurt in Swiss meals."

The salade de carotte, maïs, tomates is placed at the top of the plate and consists of shredded carrots, corn kernels, and halved cherry tomatoes, mixed with some leafy greens and a creamy dressing. The amount occupies a moderate portion of the plate space and looks loosely piled rather than densely packed. Considering the visible volume and typical density of these vegetables with dressing, the portion seems to correspond roughly to a small side salad serving. Carrots and corn are medium density, while tomatoes and leafy greens are lighter; the dressing adds some weight but not heavily. The entire pile would likely weigh between 90 to 130 grams. Positioning near the two pizza slices helps confirm that the portion is moderate but not minimal. I estimate the weight of the salade de carotte, maïs, tomates at about 110 grams as a balanced midpoint."

The image shows a single scoop of hazelnut ice cream (glace noisette) served in a small bowl with a distinct pattern. The portion is moderately sized, with an approximate volume similar to a small ice cream scoop, but slightly elongated. Hazelnut ice cream is creamy but less dense than water, roughly about 0.6-0.8 g/ml. The visible portion appears to be about 90-110 ml in volume by visual estimation based on bowl size and scoop shape. Multiplying volume by estimated density gives an estimated weight range of roughly 55-85 grams. Taking the midpoint and adjusting slightly lower due to some airiness and texture, a reasonable estimate is about 70 grams."

The 'flocon d'avoines' (oat flakes) are visible on the right half of a small white bowl. They appear as a loose, dry pile occupying about half the bowl's base surface. Considering the size of typical small bowls, and that oat flakes are light and fluffy but still have some density, the volume here is approximately equivalent to a standard portion of raw oats. This looks like roughly 30-40 grams in volume when dry. The oats do not fill the bowl deeply, so a range of 30 to 40 grams is reasonable. Choosing a midpoint for precision, an estimate of 35 grams for the oat flakes is appropriate."

The image shows four rectangular Blevita crackers stacked on top of each other. Each Blevita cracker is a thin, dry biscuit typically weighing approximately 10 grams in standard versions. These crackers look to be standard size based on their shape and the texture of the wood table for context. Since there are four crackers stacked, the total weight would be about 4 times that of a single cracker, making it around 40 grams. The crackers appear unbroken and uniform in thickness. Considering the density and typical weight of these crackers, the plausible range is about 35-45 grams, and the midpoint estimate is 40 grams."

The 'pousses de graines' (sprouts) are visible in the left central part of the bowl, mixed among some fresh spinach leaves and halved cherry tomatoes. The sprouts form a loose cluster that covers a moderate surface area but is quite light and airy, characteristic of sprouted seeds. Considering their volume and their low density as they are mostly sprouted legumes or grains, the weight should be relatively low. The sprouts appear to be roughly a small handful portion, approximately 40-60 grams. Given the visible volume distributed with the spinach and tomatoes, an estimate near the middle of that range at around 50 grams seems reasonable."

The target food item is 'carottes' (carrots), which are visible in the bowl mixed with pasta, aubergines, and gruyère cheese. The carrots appear as thin slices and strips scattered among the other ingredients. The bowl size and the amount of pasta and aubergines provide a context for the overall volume. Carrots have medium density and are fairly firm. The visible carrot portion seems to be a small fraction of the whole volume, roughly around 15-20 grams based on typical thinly sliced carrot weight. Considering the partial coverage and scattered pieces, an estimate around 18 grams is reasonable. This fits within a plausible weight range of 15-22 grams given the visible amount of carrot slices."

The image shows a plastic container filled with several pieces of pear ('poire'), cut into large segments including parts with skin. The container appears to hold pieces from roughly one medium-sized pear, judging by the number and size of pieces and their typical volume. A medium pear commonly weighs about 170-200 grams whole, including skin and core. Since these pieces exclude the core but include most edible flesh and skin, the total weight appears slightly less than a whole pear. Based on visible size, volume, and density (apear is dense but has some water content making it moderate density), I estimate the weight range between 140 and 170 grams. The midpoint would be approximately 155 grams, which seems plausible given the visible portion filling about half the container volume and the pear's density."

The asparagus ('asperges') are clearly visible on the plate as a group of about nine stalks. They appear to be cooked, not raw, as indicated by their softer, slightly darker green color. The stalks are slender and range between medium and medium-large thickness. Comparing them to the other items on the plate—the roasted potatoes and slices of jambon cru—the asparagus take up a moderate amount of space. Given that cooked asparagus typically weighs around 20 grams for 6-7 medium stalks, and here there are roughly nine slightly thicker stalks, the weight would logically be in the 45-60 grams range. The asparagus are also arranged in a cluster with little overlapping, so there's no significant hidden mass. Based on visual volume, density (medium density vegetable) and portion size typical in Switzerland, I estimate the asparagus weight at approximately 53 grams."

Considering typical household butter spreading thickness and the size of the slices (approx. 10-12 cm long, standard bread slice size), each slice likely has about 5-6 grams of butter. Multiplying by four slices, the total butter amount appears to be around 20-25 grams. The butter is neither very thick nor just a smear, so this range seems reasonable. Therefore, my estimate for the weight of butter on the plate is about 23 grams."

The tomme fleurette is located on the bottom right quadrant of the plate, identifiable by its creamy rind and soft, pale interior typical of soft tommes. Its visible portion is about the size of two small wedges placed next to each other. Considering the size relative to the bread slice in the center and the other cheese pieces, the cheese pieces are not very thick but have some bulk. Tomme fleurette is a semi-soft cheese with medium density. Given the dimensions and visible volume—approximately 4-5 cm in length and about 1-1.5 cm thick—and comparing it to the other cheeses and the fork size, the reasonable weight range is between 25 grams and 40 grams. Selecting a value near the midpoint, I estimate the tomme fleurette portion to weigh about 32 grams."
p96w4a,demi croissant,14.0,31.0,17.0,0.030199213297804846,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/a7d36c03-057f-474b-9b76-5296d4f9faef,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small piece of a demi croissant with visible layers of flaky dough. Given that it is a half croissant portion but appearing slightly eaten or smaller than a full half, we can use size relative to the plate to estimate volume. A full croissant typically weighs about 60-70 grams, so a half croissant normally would weigh about 30-35 grams. This piece looks to be close to a half portion but possibly a bit less due to some missing parts. Considering visible size and density of flaky croissant dough, the weight of this demi croissant piece is estimated to be between 28 and 35 grams. The midpoint estimation is therefore around 31 grams, which aligns with the visual cues and typical croissant weights."
r3bub9,raviolis a la courge,143.0,160.0,17.0,0.30846339297043524,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/r3bub9/dish_media/17c1535c-dc84-4dbb-9668-1d3f9a4a135d,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food, 'raviolis a la courge', is located at the top left area of the plate. There are about six large ravioli pieces visible. Each ravioli appears to be a standard size, roughly 5-6 cm in diameter and moderately thick. Cooked pasta is quite dense but not heavy; typical weight for one similar-sized filled ravioli ranges from 20 to 30 grams depending on filling density. Given the pumpkin filling, which is soft but fairly dense, I estimate each ravioli weighs around 25 grams. For six raviolis, this makes a total in the range of 140 to 180 grams. The portion looks neither overly stacked nor thin, so choosing a value near the middle at about 160 grams is reasonable. This fits with the dimensions and typical serving size visible, considering also the size of the cherry tomatoes and shredded iceberg salad for scale. Therefore, the estimated weight for the 'raviolis a la courge' is 160 grams."

The sauce bolognese is the reddish-brown meat sauce spread over the center of the spaghetti on the plate. The portion size appears medium—covering a central strip roughly 12-15 cm long and about 5 cm wide, with moderate thickness. Considering that a typical homemade bolognese sauce is dense due to meat and tomato content, and judging by the spread and depth visible, the visible portion likely weighs between 100 and 140 grams. Taking the midpoint and balancing for plate size and visible sauce volume, I estimate the sauce bolognese portion to be about 120 grams. This estimate is plausible given the pasta amount and cheese topping also present, as the sauce does not overflow the pasta base heavily but is a substantial layer."

The séré maigre is the main base component visible in the bowl, appearing as a creamy mixture with chia seeds and nut paste mixed in. The bowl looks medium-sized, with a spoon for scale; the mixture fills about half of the bowl's volume. Séré maigre has a medium density, similar to low-fat fresh cheese or Greek yogurt. Given the portion's apparent volume and thickness, I estimate the séré maigre portion to be around 140 to 180 grams. Choosing a midpoint reflecting the visible bulk and density, the best estimate is approximately 160 grams."

The specified food item is 'oeufs' (eggs), which are clearly visible as two fried eggs placed on top of a bed of cooked pasta. Each fried egg typically weighs between 45 and 60 grams when cooked, considering the loss of moisture during frying. The eggs here appear medium-sized and are fully cooked with visible yolks and whites. Given there are two eggs, the total weight range would approximately be 90 to 120 grams. The eggs cover a significant portion of the pasta below and include both white and yolk parts. Considering the visual size and typical density, I select a midpoint estimate near 105 grams to represent the two eggs together. This value fits well with the volume and the typical weight of fried eggs without excessive moisture loss or added ingredients."

The image shows a hand holding a partially unwrapped chocolate bar labeled 'branche de chocolat.' The chocolate piece is about the length of three fingers in the hand, roughly 10-12 cm long, and has a thickness and width consistent with typical snack-sized chocolate bars. Such chocolate bars usually weigh around 30 to 50 grams. Given the visible size and common density of chocolate (about 1.3 g/cm³), and considering this bar appears to be a solid chocolate with some embedded pieces (nuts or crisped rice), I estimate the weight to be around 40 grams. The plausible range, based on the visual size and typical weights of similar-sized chocolate bars, would be about 35 to 45 grams. Thus, a midpoint estimate of 40 grams is reasonable."

The image shows a single half-slice of bread (pain) on a plate. The bread is white with a crust on one edge and appears to be soft and typical of a small dinner roll or sandwich bread. Given the size relative to the plate and its apparent thickness, a whole roll or medium-sized bread slice usually weighs around 40-50 grams. Since this is about half of such a bread piece, the weight should be around half of that portion. Therefore, the estimated weight of this piece of bread is about 23 grams, considering slight variability in bread density and moisture content."

The mayonnaise is visible on the left side of the plate as a thick dollop. Considering the visual volume, it appears approximately the size of a heaping tablespoon, which typically weighs around 13-16 grams due to mayonnaise's density (about 0.95 g/ml). Given the smooth, compact appearance and the amount on the plate, an estimated portion weight would be around 15-18 grams. I choose 16 grams as a balanced estimate within this plausible range."

The target food item is 'pain,' which is visible here as a single slice of crusty bread with a topping of caviar d'aubergines. The slice measures roughly the size of a typical hand-held piece of bread, about 10 cm in length and 5-6 cm in width. The thickness looks moderate, around 2-3 cm considering the crust and crumb density. Bread typically has a density of around 0.25-0.3 g/cm3 for rustic bread, and given the air pockets visible in the crumb, it will be on the lighter side. Estimating the approximate volume as length (10 cm) x width (6 cm) x thickness (2.5 cm) = 150 cm3. Multiplying by density (~0.27 g/cm3) gives about 40 grams. Given some variability in thickness and possible moisture content, a plausible weight range is 35 to 45 grams. I estimate the bread slice weighs approximately 40 grams."

The salade (salad) is located on the left half of the plate, consisting mostly of leafy greens with some visible sunflower seeds. The leaves are loosely packed and cover about half the plate surface but are light and airy in volume. A typical serving of leafy salad like this on a plate of this size (standard dinner plate) weighs less than more dense foods. Given the volume and loose nature of the leaves, I estimate the weight to be between 30 and 50 grams. Choosing a midpoint consistent with the visible size and density, I estimate the salad weight to be approximately 40 grams."

The image shows a bread/flatbread wrap (pain/galette) that is partially rolled up in a metal container. The wrap seems to be a standard size flatbread, roughly similar to a medium tortilla of about 20-25 cm in diameter when unrolled. Considering the thickness visible at the end and the material density, the flatbread itself typically weighs less than a dense bread but more than a very thin wrap. Given its size and knowing typical weights for such flatbreads in Switzerland, its weight is likely in the range of 80-120 grams. Since this wrap is folded and slightly compressed, I estimate the weight to be near the middle of this range, around 100 grams total. This fits the visible portion and the container size well."

The 'pain bis' is a type of wholemeal bread, visible here as two slices forming a sandwich. Each slice appears to be of medium thickness, typical for sandwich bread, with a coarse texture and visible air pockets. Comparing the slices to the size of the cornichons on top, the slices seem to be of standard size (about 10-12 cm long). Typically, one slice of similar rustic wholemeal bread weighs around 40-50 grams. Given two slices are present, but the focus is on estimating the weight of a single slice (or one piece of 'pain bis' as requested), I estimate one slice weighs about 45 grams. This is reasonable given density and size compared to known bread types. The range could be 40-50 grams, so 45 grams is a good midpoint estimate."

The butter (beurre) portion is visible at the bottom of the plate as a small, irregularly shaped pat of butter. Comparing it to the other food items (like the slices of grilled bread and the nearby poultry slices), the butter portion is relatively small. Butter is dense, so even a small volume weighs considerably. The visible butter piece seems to be approximately a tablespoon size, typically around 14-15 grams. Given the size of the pat, I estimate the weight to be around 14 grams."

The 'framboises' (raspberries) are located on the right side of the plate at the bottom. There are six raspberries, each of average size, not squished or broken, displaying the typical hollow structure of raspberries. Given their size and density (raspberries are quite light but denser than strawberries), a typical raspberry weighs around 4 to 6 grams. Considering there are six berries with one somewhat larger, the total weight likely ranges between 25 and 35 grams. A midpoint estimate would be about 30 grams, which feels reasonable given the visual bulk and the comparison with the strawberries just above and the slice of bread with Nutella on the plate."

The 'graine de chia' (chia seeds) are visible distributed throughout the mixture inside the glass jar, mixed with the yogurt, oats, and other ingredients. Chia seeds are dense but are present in relatively small amounts compared to the bulk of the mixture. Judging by the visible amount and typical density, the chia seeds make up about one to two tablespoons in volume. One tablespoon of chia seeds weighs approximately 12 grams. Given the observed quantity, the range is roughly 10-20 grams. The midpoint and most plausible estimate for the chia seeds in this portion is about 15 grams."

The graines de chia (chia seeds) are visible mixed within a creamy mixture in a medium-sized white bowl. The chia seeds appear evenly distributed throughout the mixture, which primarily consists of blanc battu with flocons d'avoine and some honey. Considering the typical density of chia seeds and their dispersion, they likely amount to a small but noticeable quantity. The total mixture in the bowl is medium-sized, but since the chia seeds are few and dispersed seeds, their weight is relatively low. A typical serving of chia seeds in a dish like this is around 15-20 grams, which is consistent with the visible volume and distribution without being excessive. Given the size and appearance, I estimate the weight of the graines de chia in the bowl to be approximately 16 grams, within a plausible range of 12-20 grams."

The overall volume they occupy is moderate, spread over the top right segment of the wrap. Cherry tomatoes typically weigh around 15-20 grams each, and the visible portion corresponds roughly to one whole tomato split into pieces. Considering the visible moisture and density, their combined weight is likely around 18-22 grams. Estimating conservatively near the midpoint, I conclude the tomatoes on this wrap weigh about 20 grams."

The target food item is 'yaourt nature,' which is clearly visible in the image as a small yogurt container filled nearly to the top with plain yogurt. The container size is comparable to standard single-serving yogurt pots found in Switzerland, typically around 125 grams net weight of yogurt. The yogurt has a smooth, creamy texture and the container is about the size of the apple placed beside it, which gives a good reference for scale.

The piece of bread looks to be a small fragment, roughly 10 cm long and about 3-4 cm wide, with the chestnut cream spread evenly on top. Given the glossy, thick texture of the crème de marrons, it is denser and heavier than jam but spread thinly here. The spread covers the visible area well but not too thickly. For a spread thickness of around 2-3 mm and given the area, the amount of crème de marrons likely weighs between 15 and 25 grams. A midpoint estimate of 20 grams is reasonable. This estimate fits the visible volume and density of the spread and the relative size of the bread piece."

The target food item is 'beurre' (butter), which appears as a small rectangular pat on the upper right side of the plate. Comparing the butter portion with the nearby foods—particularly the bread slice and pieces of cheese—the butter looks like a standard serving typically given with a bread portion. The butter piece is about the size of a small slice that would comfortably fit on a small knife. Generally, such a pat of butter weighs between 8 and 12 grams depending on thickness and size. Visually, it is about 1.5 cm wide, 3 cm long, and about 1 cm thick which matches around 10 grams of butter. This estimate is plausible given the size of the bread slice and other food items on the plate and fits typical Swiss serving sizes."

The butter is spread thinly but noticeably, with a visible sheen and some small thicker spots. Typically, a thin spread of butter on one medium slice weighs about 5 to 8 grams. Since there are two slices, but the request is for the total 'beurre' (not per slice), I estimate the total butter weight on both slices combined. The butter coverage looks consistent but not thick, so a total of 10 to 15 grams seems plausible. Placing the estimate near the midpoint, about 12 grams of butter is a reasonable assessment given the visible coverage and typical density of butter."

Considering that a whole medium avocado typically weighs around 150 grams including skin and seed, the edible flesh is about 120 grams. Two slices here appear to represent roughly a third of the edible avocado portion, which aligns with about 40-50 grams. Based on the size relative to the wrap and other ingredients, a weight estimate for the avocado present on the wrap would therefore be approximately 45 grams, within a plausible range of 40 to 50 grams."

The target food item is 'beurre' (butter), which is visible on both slices of bread, spread underneath the jam and Nutella. The bread slices appear to be standard rustic bread slices (about 10-12 cm wide and 8-9 cm tall). The butter layer is thin but covers a large part of each slice's surface. A thin spread layer of butter on one slice realistically weighs about 7-10 grams, considering typical butter density and the visible coverage. Since the photo shows both slices with butter, but each slice only half visible in terms of butter (some partially covered by jam or Nutella), focusing on one slice's butter amounts to about 8 grams. I estimate the weight of the butter spread on one slice to be approximately 8 grams, with a plausible range of 6 to 10 grams depending on thickness. This estimate aligns with the visible thin but even spread and the size of the bread slice."

The specified food item is 'pain' (bread). In the image, there is one slice of brown bread placed on a black plate next to two triangular pieces of omelette aux tomates. The bread slice appears to be of standard sandwich bread size, approximately 1 to 1.5 cm thick. A typical slice of brown bread of this size from a Swiss bakery or supermarket usually weighs around 40-50 grams. Given the visible thickness and size, the slice here looks consistent with an average slice weight around 45 grams. This estimate accounts for the dense texture typical of whole grain or brown bread, and the visible volume compared to the standard slice size."
m4egh2,biscuit,8.0,10.0,2.0,0.0020301992132978047,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/5350f0cd-e92a-44fc-9770-13b4bcca327e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The biscuit is visible as several thin, crisp pieces placed on top of the ice cream in the glass. These biscuit shards are irregular in shape and relatively thin, so their density is moderate and mass is low compared to bulk. Given the size relative to the glass, which is a standard dessert parfait or sundae glass approximately 15 cm tall and 7 cm in diameter at the top, the biscuit pieces form only a light layer and do not fill a substantial volume. Typically, such thin biscuit shards weigh about 3-5 grams each. Here, the total amount seems to be about 2-3 medium-sized shards, giving a total estimate around 8 to 12 grams. Considering the visible amount and the density of a typical crispy biscuit, a midpoint estimate of 10 grams is reasonable and consistent with the visual portion size and overall dessert composition."
wrah5h,sauce vinaigrette,28.0,30.0,2.0,0.007105697246542317,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/712f4686-2c54-47d3-a8f2-811e15f6e76b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The vinaigrette sauce is visible as a shiny coating over several ingredients, especially visible as a slight gloss on the tofu, carrot, and quinoa. It is not a separate liquid pool, but rather lightly distributed. Given the size of the container, which looks like a small lunch box roughly 15x10 cm and about 4 cm deep, and considering the typical density and portion size of vinaigrette distributed over a salad, the total amount of vinaigrette is likely modest. Typically, for such a balanced salad portion, vinaigrette ranges from about 20 to 40 grams. Given the visible sheen and coverage, a mid-estimate near 30 grams is reasonable, matching the visible quantity without overflow or excess pooling. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the vinaigrette sauce to be approximately 30 grams."
8japfq,hummous,42.0,40.0,2.0,0.010658545869813475,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/0bd218b2-a4c6-4605-8737-2055d3040f25,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The hummous is located on the bottom left part of the plate, appearing as a creamy beige paste. It is a dense food that occupies a moderate volume on the plate, roughly the size of a tablespoon or a small dollop. Compared to other items such as the strawberries and olives, the hummous portion is compact but filling a visible area about 3-4 cm across and 1.5-2 cm thick approximately. Typical density of hummous is around 1 g/cm³, and given the volume this portion likely has, the plausible weight range is between 30 and 50 grams. Given the visual fullness and how the hummous sits on the plate, a midpoint estimate of around 40 grams is reasonable and consistent with similar portion sizes seen in meal servings."
p8a2w5,pizza,57.0,55.0,2.0,0.01446516939474686,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/eb0dd196-9c09-40d1-8e3d-e5f66c794af8,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small slice of pizza on a plate with a fork and knife nearby, which helps estimate scale. The slice is roughly a small corner piece, appearing to be about one-sixth or less of a typical medium pizza, judging by the curved crust and relative size to the fork. The pizza slice has visible toppings including mushrooms, tomato sauce, and some cheese. Given the typical cooked pizza slice weight ranges from 100g to 150g for a medium slice, and this slice appears smaller and partly eaten, I estimate the weight to be between 45 and 65 grams. The midpoint of this range is about 55 grams. This is plausible considering the visible thickness of the crust, toppings, and size on the plate. Therefore, the estimated weight of this small pizza slice is 55 grams."

The target food item is 'huile de lin' (linseed oil), which is a liquid and typically served in small quantities as a dressing or finishing oil. In the image, there is no visible separate container or pooling of oil on the plate; it is likely incorporated lightly or drizzled over the ingredients. Standard culinary practice for oils in a meal portion like this typically ranges from about 5 to 15 grams (ml) given its density and visible amount. Since no distinct puddle or oily sheen is distinctly visible, the portion is probably on the lower side of this range. Estimating approximately 10 grams is reasonable and consistent with the other food portions and the general visual appearance of the dish."

The image shows two slices of bread on a standard-sized white plate. Each slice appears to be medium thickness, typical of rustic or artisanal bread. The bread texture looks like a denser, crusty bread with some air pockets, suggesting moderate density. In Switzerland, a typical slice of such bread weighs approximately 40-50 grams depending on thickness. Given the visible thickness and size, these slices are likely on the heavier side of that range. Since the target food is ""pain"", and two slices are visible, I estimate the weight of a single slice of bread (one "
ppf8hc,parmesan,14.0,15.0,1.0,0.0017764243116355793,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/2833b10a-52c7-409b-ad86-f6147c323f9e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'parmesan,' which is not visually distinguishable as a separate portion from the risotto aux asperges on the plate. Typically, parmesan in such a dish is either grated and mixed into the risotto or sprinkled on top in a thin layer. Given the creamy texture and visible portions of risotto, the parmesan is likely integrated rather than served separately. The visible quantity of parmesan would therefore be relatively small compared to the risotto portion. Normally, freshly grated parmesan added to a serving of risotto weighs around 10 to 20 grams depending on the amount added. Considering the portion size of the risotto on this plate is moderate, I estimate the parmesan amount to be near the middle of this range, around 15 grams."

The 'oeuf' (egg) is visible on the right side of the plate, cut into roughly two halves, showing a firm white and a mostly cooked yolk. Comparing its size to the other components and the plate, this appears to be a medium-sized boiled egg. A typical medium hard-boiled egg weighs around 50 grams whole. Since about half of the egg is visible here, the portion on the plate is approximately 25-30 grams. Given that some pieces might be partially obscured, and that the egg white is dense and compact, I estimate the weight of the visible egg portion to be about 28 grams, within a plausible range of 25-30 grams."

The image shows a single Kinder chocolate bar resting on a wooden surface. This chocolate bar is visually consistent with the common Kinder Bueno mini-bar or the Kinder Chocolate bar format which is typically around 20 to 23 grams in weight. The bar appears intact and unbroken. Given the size relative to the grain and width of the wooden planks—a good visual scale—it matches the typical dimensions of a Kinder bar. Considering standard known weights and the visual confirmation, I estimate the weight of this barre de chocolat kinder to be approximately 21.5 grams."

The image shows a single white and milk chocolate bar, which matches the appearance of a Kinder Bueno white variant. Kinder chocolate bars typically weigh around 20-22 grams each. Given the size relative to the wooden surface texture and typical packaging of a Kinder chocolate bar, this portion is consistent with a single standard bar. There are no visible signs of it being broken or altered. Considering all this, the plausible weight range is about 20-23 grams, and I estimate the weight to be approximately 21 grams."

The épautre cuit (cooked spelt) is located in the upper left section of the glass container in the image. It occupies about one-third of the container’s base, appearing densely packed but not overflowing. The grains look plump but not wet or soggy, indicating a typical cooked grain density. The container seems approximately 15 cm wide, which suggests that the portion of cooked spelt covers roughly 10 x 6 cm in area and about 2.5 cm in depth. Cooked grains typically weigh around 130-150 grams per cup (about 240 ml). Given the volume visible, I estimate the spelt portion to be roughly between 140 and 180 grams. A midpoint estimate of 160 grams aligns well with the density and visible volume of this cooked grain portion."

The image shows a single Kinder chocolate bar, specifically a Kinder Bueno white variant as indicated by the white chocolate and characteristic ridges with brown accents. The bar size appears standard, fitting typical individual portions. Kinder Bueno bars generally weigh about 20 to 22 grams each for a single bar segment of this size. Given the visible size, shape, and the fact that it is a single complete bar piece, an estimate around 21 grams is appropriate. This aligns with known product specifications and the visual evidence presented."
2ahgvr,toast,55.0,55.0,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/feb15752-d5e3-4f73-8eeb-9fb560cc6f6b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two slices of toast with a spread of fromage frais. The two toasts appear to be standard thin sliced bread, each slice roughly 10x10 cm in size. A typical single slice of this kind of toast weighs approximately 25-30 grams. Together, the two slices would weigh about 50-60 grams. The fromage frais spread is thin and covers nearly the full surface of both slices but does not look thick or layered heavily. Given that fromage frais is a low-density creamy cheese, a thin spread on two large toast slices would weigh roughly 30-40 grams in total. Since the question is about the toast only, I exclude the fromage frais spread. Therefore, estimating only the toast, the two slices combined weigh approximately 55 grams, allowing a range of 50-60 grams for standard thin sliced bread toast. This is consistent with the visible size and density of the bread."
