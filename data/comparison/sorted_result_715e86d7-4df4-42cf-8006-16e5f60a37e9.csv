The salade verte (green salad) is located on the lower right section of the plate. It consists of iceberg and some other leafy greens with a light creamy dressing. The portion appears moderately sized but not heaped; the leaves are somewhat loosely arranged and not densely packed, which is typical for Swiss salad servings. Given the visible area covered and typical density of dressed leafy salad, I estimate the weight to be in the range of 180-260 grams. Taking a midpoint while leaning slightly lower because it does not fill the plate entirely and has air spaces between leaves, I estimate approximately 220 grams for this portion of salade verte."
p8a2w5,pillons de poulet,112.0,300.0,188.0,2.498635338791978,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/bdb25c53-2eb7-4a81-b33e-6d28997d0183,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The pillons de poulet (chicken drumsticks) are clearly visible in the lower left part of the plate. There are five pieces of grilled chicken drumsticks, each of typical portion size. In Swiss servings, a single chicken drumstick usually weighs between 60 to 90 grams considering meat and bone, but for calorie tracking, often the edible portion is estimated at around 50 to 70 grams each. Here, these pieces appear medium sized, not overly large or small. Therefore, a reasonable estimated range for all five pieces combined is approximately 250 to 350 grams total. The midpoint of this range is about 300 grams, which fits well with the visual size of the pieces in comparison to the rest of the plate. This estimate also aligns with typical Swiss portion sizes for a main protein item, ensuring it is neither underestimated nor overestimated."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,250.0,167.0,8.263794944820221,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with a tomato salad ('salade de tomates'). The tomatoes are cut into wedges and arranged in a fairly full plate, covering most of the plate's surface area. The pieces are of medium thickness and there are many wedges, suggesting a substantial portion. Tomato has a high water content and moderate density. Typical Swiss salad portions for vegetables range from 200-300g. Given the volume, fullness of the plate, and the medium size of the pieces, a reasonable estimate for the tomato salad weight is between 230-270 grams. The presence of some dressing (huile d'olive and vinaigre balsamique) and sprinkled seeds adds negligible weight in comparison. Based on these observations, I estimate the tomato salad weighs about 250 grams."

The courgette et oignons (zucchini and onions) are on the left side of the clear container. The portion fills roughly half of the container's volume on one side, appearing to be cooked and lightly sautéed. The zucchini pieces are cut into medium-sized chunks mixed with sliced onions. Considering the volume observed and that cooked vegetables typically weigh between 200-300g per Swiss portion, and given that this serving is half the container with another item filling the other half, a reasonable weight range would be 120-180g. Midpoint estimation for this portion size is around 150g. This aligns with the visible quantity and typical density of zucchini and cooked onions."

The specified food item is 'salade'. The salad portion is served on a plate, next to the risotto. It consists mostly of leafy green lettuce with some visible seeds. The salad occupies roughly one-third of the plate area and appears somewhat piled but not densely compressed. Given the loose volume and the presence of seeds, the salad is likely a lightly dressed leafy portion. Swiss typical salad portions range between 250-400g for a full side salad. This portion looks moderate, closer to a smaller side serving, visually about half or less of a large side salad portion. I'd estimate a plausible weight range between 120g (minimum) up to about 180g (maximum). Taking the midpoint for a careful estimate yields around 150g. This fits well with the moderate volume and the leafy texture observed."

The salad consists of green lettuce, carrot strips, and visible chunks of avocado, dressed with one tablespoon of olive oil and one tablespoon of vinegar. The salad is served as a side portion alongside two fried eggs and a half piece of sesame bread, suggesting a moderate portion size. The salad occupies a significant part of the plate, but since it is primarily leafy greens and some carrot with avocado pieces, the density is low to medium. Swiss portions for salads tend to be larger, about 250-400g. Here, given the volume and the presence of avocado, I estimate the salad weighs between 250g and 300g. Choosing near the midpoint, the estimate is 275g. This accounts for a realistic portion without overestimating the weight of leafy greens and considering the avocado pieces."
8japfq,épinards frais,52.0,150.0,98.0,0.6047229144416756,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/b233fd7c-865a-4287-818f-8d4fe868585e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The fresh spinach (épinards frais) is clearly visible as a bed of large green leaves underneath the other ingredients in the bowl. The portion is spread evenly and appears to be a moderate fresh serving. Considering the volume relative to the size of the tomatoes and falafels, and knowing that fresh spinach is lightweight with a typical Swiss side portion ranging from 100-150g, this portion looks larger than a minimal side but not a large serving. I estimate a plausible weight range between 130g and 170g, with a midpoint around 150g. This estimate aligns well with visual volume and typical fresh spinach densities, accounting for the fact that spinach leaves are not densely packed but still substantial in quantity here."

The image shows a single whole red apple (pomme) placed on a flat surface. The apple appears to be of small to medium size, typical for a Swiss apple portion. Considering the average weight range for apples, which is typically between 150-300 grams depending on size, and given that this apple looks slightly on the smaller side but still reasonably plump and dense, a plausible weight estimation would be around 170-210 grams. The shape and skin texture confirm it is a normal fresh apple without parts missing. Given this, a midpoint estimate near 190 grams is reasonable and consistent with typical Swiss apple portions."

The asparagus ('asperges') are located near the top central area of the plate. There are approximately 8 spears, medium thickness, and they appear cooked. Typical Swiss cooked asparagus portions usually range between 150-200 grams for a side dish portion. These asparagus are served as a side with other items, so the portion is not very large but enough to be considered a proper side serving. Considering the number, visible length, and typical density of cooked asparagus, a plausible weight range is around 140 to 180 grams. Taking the midpoint for accuracy, the estimate is approximately 160 grams."

The image shows a plate portioned with green beans with oil, red kidney beans, cooked pasta, and a dollop of mozzarella on top of the pasta. Focusing on the pasta portion, it occupies a significant central area of the plate and is a typical Swiss main carbohydrate portion. The pasta is cooked fusilli, appearing fluffy but reasonably dense. Cooked pasta Swiss portions typically range around 180-250 grams. Given the visual fullness and the plate size referencing the forks and the other food items, this looks like a moderately sized portion rather than overly large or small. I consider a plausible weight range of about 190-230 grams for the pasta. Taking the midpoint with slight bias towards a typical standard serving, I estimate approximately 210 grams of pasta."

The target food item is the 'galette millet maïs haricots noirs,' which is the two small patties located in the middle bottom section of the container. Each patty is roughly about 6-7 cm in diameter and about 1-1.5 cm thick. Considering the ingredients (millet, corn, black beans), which are dense but not overly heavy, and the compactness of these patties, the weight should be moderate. Given their sizes relative to the container and the other foods, these patties appear smaller than a typical full main portion but also not tiny snack sizes. Based on Swiss portion references for similar legume and grain patties, a single patty likely weighs around 70-90 grams. With two patties visible, the total weight estimate would be about 140-180 grams. Splitting the difference, a reasonable estimate is about 160 grams."

The image shows a slice of tiramisu on a plate, next to a piece of forêt noir cake. The tiramisu slice is about 10 cm long, 4-5 cm wide, and about 4 cm thick. The texture is creamy with some sponge soaked in coffee, typical of tiramisu. Given its volume and the moist, creamy density, a typical single serving of tiramisu weighs between 120-180 grams. Since this portion appears to be a modest single serving but not overly small, I estimate its weight at the midpoint of about 150 grams. The forêt noir piece is similar in size but is not the target here. Considering Swiss portions for desserts and visual volume, 150 grams is plausible and reasonable."
wrah5h,riz complet,82.0,160.0,78.0,0.7589889640441438,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/ee492174-b956-48fe-a4cb-4f059c9bc233,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'riz complet' (brown rice), which is located on the upper left part of the plate. The portion is a pile of cooked brown rice, moderately compact but not densely packed, roughly occupying one third of the plate surface. Comparing the rice portion to the adjacent grilled salmon fillet and carrot-corn salad, the rice's volume suggests a moderate portion size. Swiss cooked rice portions typically range from 150-180g. Given the visual volume is somewhat generous but not overflowing, the plausible weight range is about 150-175g. Choosing a midpoint toward the lower side to account for some plate space, I estimate the cooked brown rice portion at approximately 160 grams."

The image shows a mostly finished plate with a small leftover portion of pasta salad ('salade de pâtes'). The visible portion consists of penne pasta, some corn kernels, cherry tomato halves, and small bits of herbs or vegetables. The scattered pieces suggest the original portion was larger but most has been eaten. Given typical Swiss portion sizes for pasta salad (~180-250g), and estimating that around 15-20% of the portion remains visible, the leftover amount appears to weigh roughly between 30 and 45 grams. The pasta pieces are spread thinly and combined with light vegetable content, which reduces density. The reasonable midpoint estimate of this leftover portion is about 37 grams."

The viande is located in the lower left part of the plate, consisting of a single cooked meat portion that looks like a homemade burger or meatloaf slice. The piece is about the size of half the palm of a hand as comparison with the potatoes shows. Typical Swiss meat portions are between 100-120 grams per serving. Given the visual thickness and size, this meat portion appears to be somewhat dense and cooked well. The piece is not very thick but quite solid, so it seems reasonable to place it near the average Swiss standard serving size for meat. I estimate a plausible range between 105 and 130 grams, with a midpoint around 118 grams. This estimation is consistent with the size relative to the potatoes and salad components on the plate and typical Swiss portions."

The carrots (carotte) are sliced into thick rounds and arranged on the plate. Their size relative to the plate and the quinoa-bulgur mixture suggests a moderate portion typical for a vegetable side dish. The carrots appear to be cooked, making them denser and somewhat heavier than raw carrots by volume. Based on the number of slices (approximately 15-17) and their thickness, I estimate the portion to weigh between 90 and 130 grams. Given the typical Swiss portion for cooked vegetables ranges from 200-300g for a main vegetable portion and this looks closer to half of that, a midpoint estimate of about 110 grams is reasonable and plausible."

The image shows a plate with four food items: roasted chicken (poulet rôti), carrot salad (salade de carotte), potato salad (salade de pomme de terre), and celery salad (salade de céleri). The celery salad is located on the bottom right of the plate and appears as a shredded white portion. It is a small pile compared to the other items, occupying roughly the same volume as the carrot salad which is slightly larger. Considering that Swiss vegetable salads typically range from 200-300g for a full serving but this portion appears smaller and serves as a side alongside three other components, this celery salad likely weighs less than a full 250-300g serving. The portion size looks about a third to half of a typical full salad serving. I estimate the celery salad portion to be around 100-140 grams. The visible volume and texture indicate moderate density, typical for shredded celery. Averaging this range, a weight of about 120 grams is a realistic estimate. This fits well within Swiss portion size expectations and is consistent with the overall plate composition."

The image shows a bowl containing a mixture of cereals (mélange de céréales), yogurt (yogourt orange sanguine), and blueberries (myrtilles). The blueberries are visible dispersed throughout the mixture. They appear to be whole and are medium-sized, typical of fresh blueberries. Based on the visible volume and distribution in the bowl, the blueberries likely amount to roughly 20 to 30 pieces. Considering a blueberry weighs about 0.5 to 1 gram, the total weight range for the blueberries in the bowl is approximately 20 to 30 grams. Given the quantity and considering the yogurt and cereal mixture reduces the visible volume of the blueberries, estimating the weight at about 25 grams is reasonable. This aligns with typical portion sizes for fruit in a mixed bowl like this, and the amount is neither too sparse nor overwhelmingly large compared to the cereal and yogurt volume."

The salade (salad) is located on the right side of the plate. It consists mainly of leafy greens with some pieces of other vegetables or additions. The portion is relatively small and compact, covering a small part of the plate. Swiss salad portions typically range between 250-400g for large servings, but this is clearly a side portion. Given the size relative to the risotto portion (which looks like a modest serving), and considering the amount of visible volume and density of leafy greens and vegetables, a reasonable estimate would be between 70g and 100g. Thus, the midpoint estimate is approximately 85 grams. This aligns well with the visible compactness and standard side portion sizes in Switzerland."

The galettes millet haricots noirs maïs are clearly visible on the right side of the glass container. There are five galettes arranged vertically. Each looks about 3-4 cm in diameter and roughly 1-1.5 cm thick, with a dense texture because of millet, black beans, and corn. Considering the density and compactness, each galette is likely to weigh about 40-50 grams. Multiplying by five, the total weight range would be approximately 200-250 grams. Given the visible size and the typical weight for millet and bean-based galettes in Swiss portions, a mid-estimate around 225 grams is reasonable and fits the volume shown."

The croissants au jambon are located at the top left of the plate. There are two small ham croissants, each about the typical size of a mini croissant, with a flaky and golden crust. Given their compact size and that they are filled with ham, each croissant likely weighs less than a full standard croissant which is about 65-80g. Since these are smaller, estimating each at about 45-55g is reasonable, making a total range of 90-110g for the two croissants. Choosing near the midpoint and considering they are side items among several other foods on the plate, I estimate the weight of the two croissants au jambon together to be approximately 100 grams."

The image shows a single serving of hazelnut ice cream ('glace noisette') in a decorative small bowl. The portion is a moderately sized scoop, roughly the size of a small fist or a half-cup measure. Given the typical density of ice cream, and comparing the volume to the bowl size, this corresponds to approximately 90-130 grams. Considering the visual cues, I estimate a plausible weight range around 90-130g with a midpoint closer to 110g, as this is a standard single scoop portion in Swiss servings. This avoids underestimation but stays reasonable given the compact scoop and the bowl size."

The image shows a cardboard container filled with cherry tomatoes on their vine. There are about 20 cherry tomatoes visible in total. Each cherry tomato typically weighs about 20-25 grams. The tomatoes look fresh and firm, consistent with standard size. Given that the tomatoes are still attached to the vine but mostly detached except stems, the total weight should mainly reflect the fruit. Using an average weight of 22 grams per tomato and counting approximately 20 tomatoes, the plausible weight range is about 400-500 grams. This fits well within typical Swiss packaging and serving sizes for cherry tomatoes. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the cherry tomatoes to be approximately 440 grams."

The salade de carotte, mais, tomates is positioned in the upper middle of the plate. It appears to be a mixed salad with shredded carrots, corn kernels, halved cherry tomatoes, and some leafy greens (likely spinach). The portion occupies a moderate area on the plate, roughly equivalent to a small bowl serving, but it is not heaped deeply, spread somewhat flat. The plate holds two pizza slices which provide useful size context: standard pizza slices typically weigh around 100-130g each. Given that the salad portion is visually about a third to half of one of these slices in volume but is composed mainly of low density vegetables and some creamy dressing, a Swiss-style portion size for a side salad might range between 150 to 250 grams depending on fullness. Given it is a side salad rather than a full salad meal, it is likely nearer the lower-middle of this range. Therefore, estimating a range of 150-230 grams is reasonable, with a midpoint around 190 grams. This estimate fits the visual evidence of volume, ingredients, and the containing plate context while aligning with typical Swiss salad portion sizes for a side dish."

The image shows a small green bowl containing three large strawberries ('fraises'). These strawberries appear quite big, each roughly the size of a large thumb or slightly bigger. Typically, an average large strawberry weighs about 25-35 grams. Given their apparent size and the fact that there are three strawberries in the bowl, the total weight is likely between 75 grams (3 x 25g) and 105 grams (3 x 35g). Considering the size visible and the proportion of the bowl filled by the strawberries, a midpoint estimate around 90 grams is reasonable. This falls well within typical Swiss portion sizes for a small strawberry portion."

The séré maigre is visible as the creamy white base in the bowl, mixed with the seeds of chia and the purée de noisettes. From the size of the bowl and the volume occupied by the mixture, the séré maigre likely makes up the majority of the creamy mass. Considering the standard serving sizes for dairy products like séré maigre which are usually around 150-200g per serving and the visible amount that fills most of a medium bowl (approximately 300 ml volume), the probable weight of séré maigre here is between 180 and 220 grams. The chia seeds and purée de noisettes add some volume but less mass compared to the séré. Thus, the estimate for just the séré maigre is slightly less than the total volume. I estimate the séré maigre weight to be approximately 200 grams."

Together, both slices likely weigh between 80 and 100 grams. Since the target is 'pain bis' and the portion shown is two slices of bread ready to be assembled as a sandwich, the reasonable estimation is near the midpoint of this range. I estimate the weight of the 'pain bis' here to be approximately 90 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread on a plate. The lower slice is the 'tartine mélasse + beurre' which is a piece of bread spread with butter and molasses. The piece of bread appears to be a thick slice from a rustic loaf, approximately 10-12 cm in length and around 5-6 cm wide at its widest part. Considering typical Swiss bread portion sizes, a thick slice like this tends to weigh around 70-90 grams. The toppings (butter and molasses) are applied thinly and will add approximately 10-15 grams collectively. Given the visible thickness of the bread and the spread, I'd estimate the total weight of this tartine between 80 and 105 grams. Splitting the difference and prioritizing visual cues, I estimate about 93 grams for the tartine mélasse + beurre."

The specified food item is 'tomates' which are visible as two medium-sized tomato wedges on the wrap. Each tomato wedge is roughly the size of a quarter of a medium tomato. A whole medium tomato typically weighs about 150-180 grams. Two quarters correspond to half a tomato, so the tomatoes here visually represent about 75-90 grams. Given Swiss portion sizes and the visible size and thickness, I estimate the total weight of the tomates on the wrap to be around 80 grams. This fits the context well as a moderate vegetable portion on a wrap alongside other ingredients."

The specified food item is 'pâtes' (pasta), which are visible on the right side of the metal container, covered partially with grated parmesan and tomato sauce. The pasta is of the fusilli type, cooked, and appears to fill roughly half of the container's width and depth. Considering the container size and the volume occupied by the pasta, the portion seems to be a substantial but not a very large single serving. Given Swiss typical cooked pasta portions are about 180-250g, and given the visual fullness and context with other meal components (chicken and green beans), it seems a moderate portion closer to the lower-middle of that range. Therefore, estimating a plausible weight range of 180-220 grams, and choosing a midpoint for precision, I estimate the cooked pasta to weigh about 200 grams. This aligns well with the visible amount and portion patterns in similar Swiss meals."

The chicken (poulet) piece is visible at the front center of the plate, cooked and covered with some sauce. Its size appears to be roughly a medium chicken breast half, about the size of a large palm. Comparing it to the portion of fries next to it, which look like a standard side portion (usually around 150-180g), the chicken size looks in line with Swiss meat portions between 120-180g. Given the thickness, surface area, and that the chicken breast is boneless, I'll estimate a plausible weight range of about 130-170 grams. The midpoint of this range, about 150g, seems reasonable and fits the visible portion size well in the context of this meal."

The target food item is 'pain', which are three slices of bread on a plate. Each slice is of rustic multigrain style bread, with a typical thickness. Given the size of each slice relative to the plate and the visible crumbs, each piece appears to weigh about 40 to 50 grams. Considering three slices, the total weight range is roughly 120 to 150 grams. A midpoint estimation would be around 135 grams. This aligns well with typical Swiss bread portions, where a single slice is usually around 40 to 50 grams. Therefore, 135 grams is a plausible and well-calibrated estimate for the three slices of bread shown."

The target food item is 'pomme' (apple). The image shows one medium-sized apple beside a croissant on a wooden surface. The apple is of a typical medium size, which for Swiss apples generally weighs between 150-200 grams. Given its visible size and shape, and comparing it with the croissant for scale, the apple looks standard rather than very small or very large. Therefore, a plausible weight range for this apple would be about 150-180 grams, with a reasonable estimate near the midpoint. This weight is consistent with typical Swiss apple portions and the visible size in the image."

The image shows two slices of bread ('pain') on a white plate. Both slices appear to be from a typical rustic or whole grain loaf, each about average thickness (around 1.5 to 2 cm). The size of the slices relative to the plate suggests standard slice dimensions of roughly 12 cm by 6 cm. A typical slice of this type of bread weighs approximately 40-50 grams. Since there are two slices of bread visible, the total weight would be roughly 80-100 grams. Considering slight variation in thickness and typical density for this type of bread, I estimate the two slices together to weigh around 90 grams. Since the request is for the weight of 'pain' and both slices together constitute the portion, the estimate is 90 grams."

The galettes millet haricots noirs maïs are visible as three compact patties in the bowl. Each patty contains millet grains, black beans, and corn, which combined provide moderate density. They are roughly 6-7 cm in diameter and about 1.5-2 cm thick. Given the density and size, each galette likely weighs around 70-90 grams. With three galettes, the total weight likely ranges between 210 and 270 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes and the size relative to the other foods in the bowl, a midpoint estimate of approximately 240 grams is reasonable."

Based on the size and thickness of each piece, and comparing the lid size (approximately the size of a car vent panel), the total volume suggests a moderate portion typical of raw vegetables served as a snack or small side. Swiss cooked vegetable portions range from 200-300g, but raw kohlrabi is denser and this appears to be less than a full serving but more than a minimal snack portion. I estimate the plausible weight range of 130g to 180g, with a midpoint of about 155 grams. This fits the visible volume and typical Swiss portion sizes for raw kohlrabi as a snack or light side dish."

The avocado (avocat) is clearly visible on the upper right part of the galette wrap, cut into two medium slices with visible thickness. Given the size of the wrap and the typical size of an avocado half, these slices appear to represent roughly about one-third to one-half of a medium avocado. A whole medium avocado typically weighs around 150-200 grams including the skin and pit. The edible portion (without the skin and pit) roughly weighs about 130-160 grams. Since the slices here correspond to around half of the avocado flesh, estimating between 65 and 80 grams seems reasonable. Given the visible portion size and Swiss portion sizes, a weight around 75 grams is appropriate. The portion is consistent with the overall meal size, which includes other ingredients making the avocado less likely to be a full half or more. Hence, I estimate the avocado weight at 75 grams within a plausible range of 65-80 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing two distinct piles of dry ingredients. The flocon d'avoines (oat flakes) are the lighter-colored pile on the right side of the bowl. Given the size of the bowl and the visual volume of the oats compared to the flax seeds on the left, the oats cover about half the bowl's bottom area but are flat and not heaped. A typical serving of raw oats for a single portion is about 40-50 grams. Since this is a relatively moderate amount, closer to a typical breakfast preparation, the oats here look to be about 45-50 grams. An internal plausible range would be 40-55 grams, so I select the midpoint about 48 grams as a reasonable estimate."

The target foods are 'galettes millet, haricots noirs, maïs' which correspond to the patties on the right side of the bowl. These appear to be small millet patties likely mixed with black beans and corn (maïs), giving them a dense texture. There are five patties visible, each roughly 6-7 cm in diameter and about 1 cm thick. Given their dense appearance and typical Swiss portion sizes, a millet patty of this size and thickness usually weighs about 30-40 grams. Multiplying by five patties, the total weight is approximately 150-200 grams. I will use a plausible range of 140-190 grams, and choose a midpoint estimate near 165 grams. This aligns well with Swiss portion sizing for pulses and millet-based patties as a protein-rich component alongside the tomato and onion salad. The weight estimate excludes the salad portion and is consistent with typical cooking moisture and density."

The slice is medium thickness, with visible pieces of rhubarb embedded in a custard or cream filling with a pastry crust. The size of the slice appears to be about one eighth of a standard 24 cm tart, typical for a single serving. Given the density of the tart – consisting of cooked rhubarb which is mostly water, a creamy filling, and pastry crust – the weight of such a slice generally falls between 120 and 160 grams. Considering the visible volume and thickness, and the common Swiss serving sizes for fruit tarts, I estimate the slice weighs approximately 140 grams."

Considering typical Swiss portions of waffles, which are generally around 70-100 grams, and based on the size and visible density of this waffle, it looks to be on the lower to mid end of that range. The waffle is not very thick or dense, so an estimated range of 70 to 90 grams is reasonable. Taking the midpoint, I estimate the weight of this waffle to be approximately 80 grams."

The image shows a plate with several components including raviolis à la courge, cherry tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, and a glass likely containing vinaigrette. The raviolis section contains about 7 medium-sized pieces, arranged in a small pile. Each ravioli is a filled pasta piece, which tends to weigh more than simple pasta due to filling. Given the size relative to the cherry tomatoes and the plate, the total portion appears to be a modest main or substantial side serving. Typical Swiss cooked pasta portion ranges from 180 to 250 grams per serving, but ravioli with filling may be somewhat denser. The volume and density here suggest a portion near the lower to mid range of typical Swiss pasta portion sizes. I estimate the weight range for this ravioli portion between 150 grams minimum (accounting for somewhat smaller serving) and 200 grams maximum (considering the visible number and size). Selecting a midpoint for accuracy and acknowledging the modest pile, I estimate the raviolis à la courge at approximately 175 grams."

The poivron (red bell pepper) is visible as several cooked and sliced strips on the plate. The quantity appears limited to about a small handful, spread in a thin layer. Considering the volume and density of cooked bell pepper, the portion seems to be moderate but not large. Typical cooked vegetable Swiss portions range from 200-300g for a main portion, but this serving is clearly smaller as a side element to the wrap and chicken. Visually estimating, the poivron weighs likely between 60 and 90 grams. Choosing a midpoint and rounding carefully, I estimate the poivron portion to be approximately 75 grams."

The scrambled eggs (oeufs brouillés) occupy about one-third of the plate in a somewhat fluffy, loosely piled form. Comparing the size of the eggs to the gnocchi pieces and cauliflower florets, and considering the overall plate size which appears standard (about 24 cm diameter), the portion seems moderate but not overly large. Swiss typical portion for eggs in a meal is around 100-150 grams. Given the visual volume and texture (light, with some air), the weight is likely on the lower side of this range. I estimate a plausible weight range of 100-130 grams, with a midpoint near 115 grams. This fits a reasonable portion for scrambled eggs served alongside gnocchi and vegetables without overestimating the mass. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the ""oeufs brouillés"" on this plate to be approximately 115 grams."

The food item 'maréchal' refers to a type of cheese, which is seen on the plate as five small cubes amidst the salad and cucumber slices. Each cube is roughly 1.5x1.5 cm and about 1.5 cm thick, giving a total volume that can be estimated. Cheese has a relatively high density, about 1.0 g/cm³. Given the size and number of the cheese cubes, the total weight looks to be in the range of about 35 to 50 grams. Considering the visual evidence, a midpoint estimate around 43 grams is reasonable. This estimation fits the typical serving size of cheese in a salad context in Switzerland and corresponds well with the visible portion size on the plate compared to the eggs and salad adjacent to it."

The image shows a metallic container with a folded flatbread-like item identified as 'pain/galette'. It appears quite thin and flexible, typical of a wheat flour flatbread such as a tortilla or chapati. Given that it is folded twice, we see roughly one full portion spread over the container. The container size suggests a normal lunchbox or meal tray, roughly about 20-25 cm long. Flatbreads of this size typically weigh between 50 and 70 grams each. Considering the thinness of the bread and the fact that it is folded and not stacked multiple times, but a single portion size, a reasonable range is 55-70 grams. Midpoint choice is about 63 grams. This fits typical Swiss portion sizes for thin flatbread and matches the visual size and thickness without overestimation."

The tomme fleurette is the small round piece of cheese located near the bottom left of the plate. It is relatively small, approximately the size of a large bite or a tablespoon. Considering Swiss cheese portion sizes and the density of tomme-style cheeses, a typical serving in this size range would weigh around 30 to 50 grams. Given the visual size relative to the slice of baguette and other cheese pieces on the plate, the best estimate is about 40 grams. This falls into a reasonable range for a small tasting portion of cheese."

The image shows a plate filled with Chips Vaya Beans, which appear as thin, flat, and crispy chips with visible bean pieces and green specks. The chips cover most of the central area of a standard-sized plate, but they are thin and not densely stacked, suggesting limited total mass. These chips are light and airy, so despite their apparent volume, their weight is relatively low. Considering a typical serving of similar bean-based chips is around 25-40 grams and judging by the visual portion size here, this serving likely weighs near the upper part of that range but not exceeding 50 grams. Using visual volume and common packaging serving sizes as guidance, a plausible estimate range is 30-45 grams, with a midpoint estimate of about 38 grams. This aligns well with Swiss portion sizing for snack-type foods and the visual evidence present."

The specified food item is 'tomate' (tomato), which is clearly visible in the container in the middle section as sliced fresh tomato. The tomato slices appear to be about half the container's length, spread relatively evenly in a single layer, and are moderate in thickness. Considering the container size relative to the visible kitchen counter, it seems to hold a small to medium portion. Tomato is mostly water and light in density, so even though it covers a decent area, the weight won't be very high. A typical medium tomato weighs roughly 120-150 grams, and visually this looks like less than one full tomato, roughly half to two-thirds of one. Therefore, a plausible range would be about 60 to 90 grams. Picking a midpoint estimate, I assign 75 grams to the tomato portion present here. This fits well with the visible size, the portion relative to other elements like mozzarella and millet, and Swiss portion context."

The slice contains a moderate amount of cream filling, a crispy tart crust which has some crumbled pieces on the plate, several large strawberry halves sitting on top, and a few red currants. The strawberries look fresh and relatively large. Considering the visible thickness of the cream and the crust, and comparing the plate size (a standard dessert plate) to the tart slice dimensions, the portion seems consistent with a slice of about 120g to 160g. The midpoint of this range would be about 140g. This estimate aligns with typical Swiss dessert slice portions which tend to be moderate rather than overly large.

The vegetables portion on the plate consists of sautéed zucchini and onions cooked with approximately 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Visually, the vegetables cover about a quarter of the plate area and are sliced moderately thick, cooked until tender. Given the volume and typical Swiss portion sizes, cooked vegetables like this usually weigh between 200 and 300 grams per serving. Considering the plate also contains rice and an egg, indicating a balanced meal, this vegetable portion seems closer to a medium side rather than a large main. Thus, a plausible weight range is approximately 180-230 grams.

Each half slice is approximately 3-4 cm wide and 7-8 cm long, with a visible thick crust and aerated crumb indicative of artisanal bread. Typically, a full slice of this bread type weighs around 40-50 grams due to its density and size. Given that only two half slices are present (together forming roughly one full slice), the weight estimate should consider one full slice size. Considering Swiss bread portioning and the visible portion, a weight range of about 38-52 grams is plausible. I position the estimate near the midpoint at 45 grams for this serving of bread that is buttered and spread with topping. This aligns well with typical bread slice weights in Switzerland and the visible size shown in the image."

The boiled egg (oeuf) is visible on the right side of the plate, cut in half with its yolk partly exposed. The size of the halves appears quite standard relative to the plate and other food items such as the cherry tomatoes and asparagus stalks. A typical medium-sized boiled egg weighs around 50-60 grams including shell, but with the shell removed, the edible portion is usually around 45-50 grams. Given this is half an egg shown, the portion visible corresponds to about 22-25 grams of egg white and yolk. Considering the whole egg weight is implied by the two halves on the plate, the total weight of the boiled egg served is likely around 50 grams. This fits well with standard Swiss portion sizes for eggs served as part of mixed meals."

The target food item is 'pain' (bread), which is a half piece of a white bread slice visible on a large white plate. The thickness appears typical for sandwich bread, and the size roughly corresponds to half of a standard slice of bread. A full slice of sandwich bread in Swiss portions usually weighs about 30-40 grams. Since only half a slice is shown, the weight of this piece of bread would be approximately half that amount. Considering the visible thickness and size, I estimate the weight of this half slice of bread to be about 18 grams, with a plausible range of 15-21 grams. This aligns with typical bread slice weights and fits well compared to the size of the plate and the visible portion of spread on top."

The beurre (butter) is spread on four small slices of bread. Each slice has a thin to moderate layer of butter with some portions showing more coverage. Typically, a thin spread of butter on a slice of bread weighs about 5-7 grams, and considering four slices with variable coverage, a total butter portion of around 20-28 grams is plausible. Given the visible amount and typical Swiss consumption, I estimate the total butter weight to be approximately 24 grams."

The image shows a small bowl filled with fresh blueberries (myrtilles). Blueberries typically weigh about 0.5 to 1 gram each. In this bowl, there are roughly 55-65 blueberries visible, and the bowl appears to be filled almost to the top. Considering the average weight and the apparent volume, a typical container of blueberries like this holds between 150 and 200 grams. Given the bowl size relative to the hand and the fullness, I estimate the total weight of the blueberries to be around 180 grams, which fits well within the standard portion range for a serving of blueberries."

The image shows a single chocolate bar ('branche de chocolat') partially unwrapped, held in a hand. Judging by the scale relative to the fingers, the chocolate piece is about the size of a standard chocolate stick or slender chocolate bar. These types of chocolate sticks typically weigh between 30 to 50 grams. Given the thickness and visible nuts or inclusions in the chocolate, which add weight, I estimate the weight closer to the middle-to-upper part of that range. Therefore, a plausible weight range is 35-50 grams. Choosing a midpoint while considering the inclusion of nuts, I estimate the chocolate bar to weigh approximately 42 grams."

The sautéed vegetables (légumes sautés) consisting of carrots and leeks are located on the right side of the plate. They appear chopped and cooked, with a mix of soft textures. The volume covers a moderate area on the plate but is not piled thickly, suggesting a medium portion. Compared to the other items on the plate—white rice and fish—the vegetable portion is substantial but not overly large. Typically, cooked vegetables for a Swiss side portion range between 200 and 300 grams. Given the moderate volume and density of the sautéed vegetables here, an estimated weight range would be around 180 to 250 grams. The portion is neither minimal nor overly generous, so a reasonable estimate near the midpoint is about 215 grams. This matches the visible quantity and typical Swiss portion sizes for cooked vegetables served as a side."

The image shows a small plate with three types of berries: strawberries (fraises), raspberries (framboises), and blueberries (myrtilles). The blueberries are grouped on the left side and there are about 13 visible blueberries. Blueberries typically weigh between 0.5 and 1 gram each. Assuming an average weight of about 0.8 grams per blueberry, 13 blueberries would weigh approximately 10 to 11 grams. Considering some may not be fully visible or slightly varied in size, I estimate the total weight of the blueberries on the plate to be between 10 and 15 grams, with a midpoint estimate of about 13 grams. This fits with the expected Swiss portion of a small fruit serving and appears consistent with the visible volume compared to the other fruits on the plate."

The pizza with mushrooms (champignons), olives, and courgettes is clearly visible on a large white plate. There are four slices remaining from what looks like a medium-sized pizza, so roughly half or slightly less of the pizza remains on the plate. The slices are thin-crust style with visible vegetables as toppings. Typical medium pizzas weigh between 350-450 grams in total. Considering half of the pizza is present, the portion visible weighs about 175-225 grams in total. Estimating the total weight of the pizza is roughly 400g, so the four slices weigh about 200g. Separating toppings from dough is difficult, but the total weight for the pizza including crust, cheese, and toppings is the best indicator. Since the request is for the entire pizza portion with these toppings, I estimate the pizza portion here weighs approximately 200 grams."

The salami slices are located on the right side of the plate, appearing as about 5 thin slices, along with some smaller broken pieces. Each slice is relatively thin and not particularly large in diameter, typical of a snack portion rather than a full meal portion of salami. Given the thinness and typical weight density of salami, a standard thin slice usually weighs around 5-7 grams. Multiplying this by 5 slices gives a range between 25 and 35 grams. Considering the broken pieces add a bit of extra weight, I estimate the total salami portion to be roughly 30 grams. This is consistent with Swiss portion sizes for a small charcuterie serving alongside other items."

The salade grecque is presented in a rectangular plastic container, about three-quarters full, with visible diced vegetables including cucumber, tomato, yellow pepper, green pepper, black olives, onion rings, and small pieces of feta cheese. The portion size looks like a single serving, typical for a packed salad in a container of this size. Considering Swiss portions for salads (250-400g) and the volume filled in this container, the weight is likely on the lower end of the range, given that it is diced and includes some light vegetables and cheese. The container size and quantity of salad corresponds to approximately 280-320 grams. Choosing a midpoint estimate, I assess the salade grecque to weigh around 300 grams."

The image shows two slices of toasted brown bread, each with a thin spread of fromage frais. The target food item is ""toast,"" which refers to the two pieces of toasted bread visible on the plate. Each slice of toast is about standard sandwich bread size common in Switzerland, roughly 10x10 cm in surface area and about 1.5 cm thick. A typical slice of whole-grain or brown bread weighs approximately 35-45 grams before toasting; toasting does not significantly alter the weight. Since there are two slices shown, but the instruction is to estimate the weight of one specified item, I infer the toast as a single slice, as both slices would weigh roughly the same. The fromage frais layer is thin and should not be included in the toast weight as it is a separate food item. Using this reasoning and standard bread slice weights in Switzerland, I estimate the weight of one toast slice as approximately 40 grams, with a plausible range between 35 and 45 grams depending on slice thickness and density. This aligns well with typical bread slice weights and the visual evidence in the image, where the bread appears ordinary in size and thickness."

The carrots are visible as several thin slices scattered mixed with the pasta and aubergines in the bowl. They appear to be cooked and are relatively thin, so their density is moderate. The total volume occupied by the carrots is moderate but clearly less than the pasta portion, given the sparse distribution. Considering Swiss typical vegetable cooked portion sizes (200-300g) and the fact that carrots are just one component mixed with pasta and aubergines, the carrot portion is likely smaller. Estimating a minimum of about 40g and a maximum of about 65g for the visible carrot slices, I choose a midpoint estimate of around 53 grams, which is plausible given the visible amount and the context of the dish."

The sauce bolognese is the reddish meat and tomato-based sauce visible on top of the pasta. It covers a central strip of the pasta portion and has a moderate thickness. Considering Swiss typical portion sizes for meat-based sauces, and the visual volume here, I'd estimate the sauce bolognese portion weighs between 120 and 180 grams. The visible sauce layer is neither very thick nor very thin. Taking the midpoint of this plausible range and the overall sauce coverage, I estimate the sauce bolognese weight to be approximately 150 grams, consistent with Swiss portion sizes for a side or topping sauce serving on pasta."

The specified food item is 'graine de chia,' or chia seeds, which are visible mixed within a jar containing a yogurt base with oats and other ingredients. The total volume in the jar is around 200-250 ml, with chia seeds distributed throughout. Chia seeds absorb liquid and swell, so their volume in the mix is larger than their dry weight. Typically, a serving of chia seeds in such a preparation is roughly 15-25 grams. Given the visible amount dispersed evenly throughout the jar and the thickness of the mixture, the chia seeds likely weigh about 20 grams in total, within a plausible range of 15 to 25 grams."

The image shows a lunch box with several distinct food items, each occupying roughly equal parts of the container. The sauce vinaigrette is visible as small drops mainly on the tofu and carrots, but the container is not full of vinaigrette; the amount is small and scattered. Vinaigrette is a liquid and usually served in small quantities due to its strong flavor and calorie density. Considering the size of the container and the visible vinaigrette distribution, it likely holds between 10-20 grams of vinaigrette. The middle point of this plausible range is about 15 grams. Given the distribution and that this is a single serving with modest dressing, I estimate the vinaigrette weight at around 15 grams."

The biscuit is visible as thin, broken pieces placed on top of the ice cream in a glass dessert cup. The biscuit appears to be a light, crisp type and only a few pieces are visible, roughly covering a small area of the top of the dessert. Given the size relative to the scoops of ice cream, the biscuit pieces likely weigh less than 30 grams in total. Considering the thinness and crunchy texture which suggests low density, I estimate the biscuit weight to be between 15 and 25 grams, with a midpoint estimation of about 20 grams."

The graines de chia (chia seeds) are visibly mixed throughout the bowl along with blanc battu, flocons d'avoine, and some honey. Chia seeds are very small and dense, but because they are dispersed and mixed, the overall volume appears moderate. The bowl size is a standard mixing bowl, and the chia seeds are not the main bulk of the dish, only a sprinkle or mixed portion. Typically, chia seed portions used in such a mix range around 15-25 grams per serving. Based on the visual proportion relative to the rest of the ingredients, I estimate the weight of the chia seeds to be approximately 20 grams, with a plausible range of 15 to 25 grams."

The salade de pâtes is clearly visible at the bottom left of the plate. It consists of a modest portion of spiral pasta mixed with small amounts of vegetables like tomato and corn. Given the portion occupies a relatively small area and thickness on the plate compared to the meat and carrot salad, and considering Swiss cooked pasta portions typically range from 120 to 150 grams for a normal serving, this side portion appears smaller than a full serving. The pasta portion seems roughly half to two-thirds of a standard portion. Estimating a plausible range between 70 and 100 grams, a midpoint value of about 85 grams is appropriate for this salade de pâtes portion. This aligns with the visual volume and the overall context of a meal with multiple components."

The portion of 'beurre' (butter) on the plate is a small slice or pat, clearly visible near the bottom right of the plate. Its size is approximately that of a small knife spread, about 3-4 cm in length and somewhat thick but not bulky. Butter is dense and heavy relative to its volume, so even a small pat can weigh noticeably. Typical single pats or small blocks of butter used as a portion measure around 10-20 grams usually. Here, the pat is moderately sized but not large, more like a standard single serving portion of butter used for spreading on bread. Given the visual size and context (two grilled bread pieces), I estimate the butter weight realistically around 15-18 grams. The plausible weight range is roughly 12-20 grams, with 16 grams close to the midpoint and matching the visual evidence. This fits Swiss portion sizes for a butter serving accompanying bread, and aligns with the relative size of surrounding items on the plate without overestimating."

The mayonnaise is on the left side of the plate and appears as a small dollop with a smooth and creamy texture. It's separate from the other items and clearly visible, occupying roughly the space of a tablespoon or slightly more. Considering that mayonnaise is dense but light in volume, a dollop like this commonly weighs between 30 and 45 grams depending on thickness. Given the portion size relative to the other foods, I estimate the mayonnaise to be approximately 38 grams, which is near the midpoint of this plausible range."

The image shows several pieces of pear ('poire') cut into large chunks inside a clear plastic container. The container is likely around 0.5 liters volume based on visible markings. The pear pieces are sizable, mostly halves or large wedges including the skin, which contributes to weight. A typical whole medium pear weighs around 150-180 grams. Judging by the number and size of the pieces (approximately 5-6 large chunks), this corresponds roughly to one whole medium pear. Taking into account moisture content and density, and verifying with Swiss portion typical fruit weight ranges, it's reasonable to estimate the total weight of the pear pieces here to be between 150 and 180 grams. A midpoint estimate of 165 grams is appropriate."

The target food item is 'oeufs' (eggs), which are clearly visible as two fried eggs placed on top of a plate of cooked pasta. The eggs cover a moderate area and appear cooked with some runny yolk visible. Typically, a single large fried egg weighs around 50 grams. Two eggs would thus weigh approximately 100 grams in total. Considering the size of the eggs in relation to the pasta and the plate, this estimate seems reasonable. Swiss portions for eggs in a meal like this would most often involve 1-2 eggs, matching this visual evidence. The plausible range is 90-110 grams, so the midpoint estimate of 100 grams is appropriate."

The image shows a single slice of bread ('pain') with some eggplant spread (caviar d'aubergines) on it. The slice of bread appears to be from a rustic loaf, with a crusty exterior and a dense crumb. The portion size is about the size of a typical small bread slice, roughly 10 cm in length and 5-6 cm in width, and about 2-3 cm thick. Given the density and typical weight of rustic bread of this size, such a slice generally weighs between 50 and 70 grams. There is no indication the bread is unusually thick or thin, so the weight estimate is centered around 60 grams. The eggplant spread on top does not affect the weight of the bread itself, so it is not included in this estimate. Therefore, the estimated weight for the 'pain' portion in the image is about 60 grams, within a plausible range of 50-70 grams."

The image shows a small portion of a demi croissant with some butter and apricot jam on top. The croissant piece looks like a bite-sized portion, not a full half. A typical Swiss demi croissant weighs about 40-50 grams in total. Given that this is only a part of the demi croissant, roughly around 40-50% of it, the visible portion likely weighs between 18 and 25 grams. The butter and apricot jam smoothing and spreading are very thin layers and add minimal weight, approximately 3-5 grams combined. Overall, the piece shown in the image including spread toppings is estimated around 22 grams, reflecting a moderate bite portion that fits the visual size on the plate."

The image shows a small, partially eaten slice of pizza on a plate with crumbs scattered around, indicating the meal is mostly finished. The slice appears to be about one-eighth to one-sixth of a standard pizza, with a thick crust and visible toppings including mushrooms and tomato sauce. Typical Swiss pizza slices weigh approximately 100-130 grams when whole, depending on size and thickness of the crust and toppings. Since this slice is about one-sixth of a pizza and partly eaten, the remaining visible portion likely weighs less than a full slice. Considering the visible size and thickness, the plausible weight range for this partial slice is about 40-60 grams. Choosing a midpoint value, I estimate the weight of the visible pizza slice to be approximately 50 grams."

The mozzarella is represented by the white creamy portion on top of the pasta. It looks like a small dollop or scoop, roughly the size of about two tablespoons. Mozzarella in this form (likely fresh or a soft cheese like stracciatella or burrata cream) usually weighs around 20-30 grams per tablespoon. Given the portion size, it appears to be approximately 50-70 grams. Considering Swiss portion norms and the volume relative to the pasta portion (which is moderate), a weight around the midpoint of 60 grams is plausible. The range of 50-70 grams accounts for slight variations in density and portion rounding."
8japfq,muesli nature,64.0,58.0,6.0,0.04556781772872909,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/c79855ed-5948-4858-9b6d-264b75558907,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The muesli nature is presented in a small to medium-sized round bowl, filled to the top with large clusters of oats and grains. Muesli is dry and somewhat dense but with some air pockets due to the clusters. Given the size of the bowl relative to the white square dish of natural yogurt beside it (which helps provide scale), this bowl seems to hold roughly about one typical Swiss serving of muesli. Typically, a Swiss portion of dry muesli weighs around 40-60 grams depending on the cluster density. Here, the bowl looks quite full and the clusters are dense, so the weight leans towards the upper side of that range. Therefore, it's plausible to estimate a minimum-maximum range of 50 to 65 grams for this portion of muesli. The midpoint of about 58 grams aligns well with the visual evidence and portion norms. Thus, I estimate the muesli nature weighs approximately 58 grams."

The huile de lin (linseed oil) is a liquid and not visibly separate on the plate, likely used as a dressing or cooking ingredient. Since no distinct pool or container of oil is visible, the amount present must be small, typical of an oil drizzle or mixed into the food. Standard serving size for oil in a meal preparation is about 10-15 grams (roughly one tablespoon). Considering the visible food portions and the likelihood that the oil is used as a dressing or cooking fat rather than a large separate amount, I estimate the huile de lin used here would be about 12 grams, within a plausible range of 8-15 grams."

The 'pousses de graines' (sprouted seeds) are located in the center-left area of the bowl, mixed lightly with fresh spinach leaves and cherry tomatoes. They form a modest pile, roughly covering an area about 7-8 cm in diameter, but are thin and lightweight as sprouted seeds typically are. Given their low density and the volume they occupy, a typical serving of sprouted seeds in a salad like this would weigh between 25 and 40 grams. Considering the visible portion and the context of a mixed salad with multiple other components, the weight should be closer to the lower-middle part of this range. I therefore estimate the weight of the 'pousses de graines' in this image to be about 33 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread with toppings: one slice with butter and molasses (mélasse) and the other with butter and Nutella. The specified food item is molasses. The molasses is spread thinly and unevenly over the upper slice of bread. Considering the typical density and thickness of a molasses spread on bread, it is a thin layer that likely weighs less than 15 grams. The bread slice itself is not part of the target food. Since molasses is dense and sticky but used sparingly, a reasonable estimate for the molasses portion would be in the range of 8 to 12 grams. The visual thickness suggests closer to 10 grams as a midpoint. This estimate aligns with typical molasses usage on toast in a Swiss context, avoiding overestimation."

The image shows a single slice of tresse bread with butter and apricot jam spread on top. The slice of tresse appears to be of standard thickness and size, typical for Swiss bread portions. However, the butter is a thin layer spread over the surface of the bread, visible mostly in white patches beneath the jam. Given that butter is spread thinly and the visible amount is moderate, the weight of the butter is relatively small. A thin spread of butter on one slice of bread is usually around 5-10 grams. Considering the spread thickness and surface coverage observed here, I estimate the butter to weigh about 7 grams. This is consistent with typical serving sizes and the visual evidence that it is not heavily layered."

The image shows a single thick slice of bread on a small plate along with two pieces of tomato omelette. The bread appears to be a whole grain or brown bread slice, and judging by its size relative to the omelette pieces and the plate, it is a typical slice from a loaf, approximately 1.5 cm thick. Standard portion weights for a slice of bread of this size usually range between 40 and 60 grams depending on density and thickness. Given that this slice is moderately thick and visually dense, I estimate the bread slice weighs around 50 grams, within a plausible range of 45-55 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread, each with a spread: one with butter and one with Nutella and jam. The target food item is 'beurre' (butter), visible as a thin layer spread over the bread slice with the jam on top. The butter is not piled thickly but spread moderately thin. A typical butter serving spread on a single slice of bread usually weighs between 5 and 10 grams, depending on thickness. Here, the butter layer looks moderate, around 7 to 8 grams. Considering the visual thinness and typical spread amount for breakfast bread, I estimate the weight of the butter to be about 7.5 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread on a plate, each spread with different toppings. The target food is 'beurre' (butter), visible as a thin spread on both slices, although more clearly on the slice with mélasse (molasses). Given the typical thin spreading of butter on bread in a Swiss breakfast context, and considering that a moderate spread of butter on one slice of bread usually weighs between 5 and 10 grams, I estimate the butter portion on the mélasse slice to be near the midpoint of this range, about 7 grams. The butter is thinly spread, and not in a thick pat, so it would not exceed this range. Therefore, the estimated weight for the butter on this slice is 7 grams."

The spaghetti on the plate appear to be a single serving, cooked and presented with some pesto and sprinkled gruyère cheese. Visually, the spaghetti fills most of the plate in a loose mound. Considering Swiss portion sizes, a typical cooked pasta serving weighs between 180 and 250 grams. This portion looks moderate in size, slightly above average but not exceptionally large. Considering the depth of the noodles and their volume relative to the plate, an estimated range of 200 to 230 grams seems reasonable. Thus, the midpoint would be about 215 grams."

The image shows a single chocolate branch, a processed confectionery item typically composed of a crunchy or nutty core covered in milk chocolate. This item is about the length and thickness of a standard chocolate stick, approximately 12-15 cm long and roughly 2-3 cm in diameter. Based on common Swiss confectionery sizes and known weights for similar chocolate sticks (such as Suchard's 'Schweizer Schoggi' bars or similar items), the weight is usually around 25 to 35 grams. The visible chocolate coating and texture suggest a standard mass without any excessive bulk. Consequently, considering the size and type, I estimate the weight of this chocolate branch to be around 30 grams, with a plausible range between 25 and 35 grams."

The hummous is the beige-colored creamy paste located at the bottom left of the plate. It appears as a single dollop roughly the size of a large tablespoon. Considering typical serving sizes and the volume of this portion, it looks like a moderate side dollop rather than a large scoop. For hummous, a standard serving is around 30-50 grams. Given the volume and visual comparison with other items on the plate such as the olives and the strawberry sizes, the hummous here likely weighs about 40-45 grams. An estimation range might be 35-50 grams to cover slight visual uncertainty. The midpoint, 43 grams, seems most reasonable."

The parmesan in the image is seen sprinkled on the risotto aux asperges; it appears as a thin layer of grated cheese on top of the rice and asparagus. Parmesan is a dense, hard cheese, but the portion on the plate looks modest and finely grated, not heaping or thick. Considering that typical Swiss serving sizes of grated cheese used as a garnish or complement to a dish usually range between 10-25 grams, and given the small visible quantity here, an estimated range of 10-20 grams seems reasonable. Selecting a midpoint close to 15 grams aligns well with the visual evidence and typical Parmesan garnish amounts on a plate of this size."

The cooked spelt (épautre cuit) is visible on the left side of the transparent container. The portion appears to be dense grains filling about one-third of the container volume. Compared to the scrambled eggs and oven-baked eggplant next to it, the spelt looks like a moderate serving. Cooked spelt typically has similar density and portion size to cooked whole grains such as rice. Swiss cooked rice portions are around 150-180g, so for spelt, which is similar, a portion filling this volume should be in the same ballpark. Given the visual volume and compactness, I estimate a range of approximately 140 to 180 grams for this amount of cooked spelt. Choosing a midpoint near 160 grams fits with the visual evidence and typical Swiss portion sizes for cooked grains."

The image shows a plate with three visible food items: bulgur, ratatouille, and a hard-boiled egg (œuf dur) cut in half. The œuf dur is clearly visible on the left side of the plate, showing two halves of one hard-boiled egg. A typical medium-sized large egg weighs around 50-60 grams when boiled. Considering that the egg appears to be whole and cut in half, and its size relative to the utensils, the weight estimate should reflect one entire hard-boiled egg including the shell, but since it’s just food weight on the plate, the shell is excluded. The edible portion (white and yolk) is roughly 50 grams. The range for a whole boiled egg without shell is about 45-55 grams. Given the visual confirmation and standard estimates for a hard-boiled egg, an estimate of about 50 grams is appropriate and plausible in this context."
