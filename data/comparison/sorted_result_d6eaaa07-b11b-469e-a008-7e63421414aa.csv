wrah5h,"délice des dieux (biscuit, fruits rouges, séré+mascarpone)",325.0,110,215.0,8.643617021276595,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/560d1e28-3692-4e4d-bdaf-3abb5f44be7a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single portion of 'délice des dieux,' which is a layered dessert consisting of biscuit, red fruits, and a mixture of séré and mascarpone cream. Step 1: Visually, the dessert piece is roughly square-shaped, occupying a central portion of a standard-sized dessert plate, which typically ranges between 18-20 cm diameter. Step 2: Dimension analysis shows the piece to be about 7 cm wide and approximately 1.5-2 cm thick. The base is a biscuit that looks dense, covered by a creamy layer mixed with red berries (likely raspberries and blackcurrants). The cream layer appears thick and creamy, suggesting moderate density. Step 3: Considering densities, biscuit is relatively dense, mascarpone-based cream is lighter but still thick and has a moderate density. Fruits add volume but are lighter. Step 4: Portion size aligns with a medium Swiss dessert portion, not overly large. Step 5: Estimating weights individually — biscuit base (~40 grams due to compaction), cream with mascarpone and séré (~50 grams considering density and volume), and fruits integrated within and on top (~20 grams). The total is about 110 grams. This aligns with typical Swiss dessert portions for such a dish. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'délice des dieux' piece is approximately 110 grams."
2ahgvr,salade grecque,315.0,180,135.0,5.260390895596239,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/c476a6d0-acb2-45fd-b168-84822bc98003,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'salade grecque' which is visible in a rectangular plastic container on a wooden table. The salad consists mainly of small diced vegetables including yellow and red bell peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, some onion rings, small pieces of feta cheese, and black olives, all mixed and coated with a salad dressing. The container is about medium size for a single portion, roughly comparable in width to the width of the wooden table slats; the visible depth of the salad inside the container is approximately half the container height (the container is not fully filled). The diced pieces are small, and the overall volume of the salad is about 1/3 to 1/2 of a typical small to medium lunch container. Considering the density of the mixed vegetables plus feta cheese and olives, and the dressing which adds little weight, the salad density is moderate to light. Typically, Swiss portions for such a salad would be around 150 to 250 grams. Given the visible quantity in the container, and accounting for the layers and depth, I estimate the weight of the salade grecque to be at the lower-middle of this range, approximately 180 grams."
p8a2w5,sandwich bahn mi au bœuf,313.0,200,113.0,4.375185551707076,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/022d6625-56d2-43cd-a1e0-77ae2cf08703,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a banh mi sandwich with beef as the main protein, nestled in a small to medium-sized baguette typical of Swiss portion sizes. The sandwich is visually about the length of a hand (approx. 15-18 cm), moderately filled with visible fresh vegetables including sliced cucumber, pickled radish, cilantro, and carrots. The bread appears crusty but relatively light, and the filling is moderate, not overly packed. The beef component, while present, seems modest in volume with perhaps a few thin slices distributed within. Considering typical density of cooked beef and the mixture of vegetables, the filling likely weighs around 100-120 grams total, with the beef portion about 40-50 grams. Since the target is the sandwich banh mi au bœuf, the entire completed sandwich weights are roughly 180-220 grams, but focusing solely on the sandwich (including bread and filling but excluding external packaging), and considering Swiss portion control, the estimated total weight is approximately 200 grams."
2ahgvr,porridge salé,48.0,160,112.0,0.6650173181593271,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a35f3211-3b33-4826-97b8-3af69655dada,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small glass jar containing porridge salé (savory porridge). The jar has a diameter of 70 mm (7 cm) at the lid, so the jar itself is roughly similar or slightly narrower. The porridge fills about 70-80% of the jar's volume. Given the jar’s height appears around 7-8 cm, and porridge has a medium-high density due to the oats and liquid absorbed, the volume of porridge inside is approximately 150-180 ml. Oat porridge density is close to 1 g/ml because of the water content, so the weight is roughly equal to its volume in grams. Considering some air volume and texture, I estimate the weight of the porridge salé in the jar to be around 160 grams."
wrah5h,omelette aux tomates,209.0,110,99.0,2.559500247402276,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/c4d2e0f7-71f7-4e23-bc37-43a0aff738da,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two triangular portions of an omelette with visible tomato pieces on a black plate. The omelette pieces have some thickness and are fairly dense, made mostly of cooked eggs and tomato chunks. The tomato pieces are integrated into the omelette and are of moderate size. Each omelette piece appears to be roughly 10 cm wide at the base, with a thickness of about 1.5 cm. Given the density of cooked eggs and tomato pieces, the combined weight of these two omelette pieces is likely in the range of 90 to 130 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes tend to be smaller and the plating shows no extra hidden portions, a medium estimate near the middle of that range is appropriate. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the 'omelette aux tomates' shown to be approximately 110 grams."
6fwmw2,mélange de porc et légumes façon thaï,295.0,205,90.0,3.28426521523998,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/6fwmw2/dish_media/ec6d03db-ac9d-4ca2-92e1-96ab989361cb,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'mélange de porc et légumes façon thaï', which is a mix of pork and Thai-style vegetables. Visually, the portion covers roughly half to two-thirds of a medium black bowl, sitting on top of rice noodles. The mixture includes visible chunks of pork meat and a variety of vegetables such as broccoli, red pepper, carrots, peas, mushrooms, and eggplant, all coated in a sauce. The pork pieces are small to medium-sized and scattered evenly. The vegetables appear cooked but still firm, maintaining volume and density. Considering the density of cooked pork and vegetables combined, this portion is dense but not overly compact. Estimating the volume to be around 250-300 ml in this bowl, accounting for some hidden depth, the weight of the mixture would likely be between 180 and 230 grams. Given the visible amount and Swiss portion size context, I will take the middle range estimate and conclude approximately 205 grams for the mélange de porc et légumes façon thaï."
p96w4a,croissants au jambon,37.0,110,73.0,0.33411677387431965,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/7bd6e67d-b1ca-42e4-a5ca-713b7fadda27,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'croissants au jambon'. In the image, there are two small croissants on the plate, which are visibly filled or layered with ham ('au jambon'). Each croissant appears to be of a smaller, Swiss-style portion size, roughly the size of a standard small croissant, approximately 7-8 cm in length and about 4-5 cm wide. The thickness is typical for croissants, with some air pockets, but ham filling adds density. A plain small croissant usually weighs about 50 grams, but here, with ham added, each croissant would weigh slightly more. Given the smaller size and visible ham filling inside, I estimate each croissant au jambon to weigh around 55 grams. For two croissants, that totals approximately 110 grams. Considering slight variations and visual evidence, I estimate the total weight of the two croissants au jambon on the plate to be 110 grams."
8japfq,tomate,89.0,23,66.0,0.7266204849084612,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/e3dd97fc-f060-4191-b7c5-c7c2100b5e6e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a glass container with three distinct foods: cooked wheat grains ('blé') on the left bottom, gratin of Swiss chard with cream and sundried tomatoes on the top left, and sliced tomato on the right side. The target food item to estimate is 'tomate' (tomato). Visually, the tomato is sliced into six fairly even slices stacked on each other, occupying about a third of the container's surface area on one side. Considering the container size corresponds roughly to a small meal portion, the tomato slices look about medium-sized in diameter as well. The slices appear fresh and juicy, suggesting typical tomato density slightly less than water (~0.95 g/cm3). Estimating the diameter near 7 cm and average slice thickness around 0.7 cm, gives volume close to 23 cm3. Multiplying by the density, that equals approximately 22 grams. Considering some slight variance in thickness and moisture, a medium portion estimate is around 20-25 grams, so I estimate the total weight of the sliced tomato to be 23 grams."

The target food is ""brochette de boeuf,"" which is clearly visible as three beef chunks skewered on a thin wooden stick, placed at the top center of the plate. The pieces are roughly uniform in size, approximately 4-5 cm long and about 3-4 cm wide and thick each. Given the density of cooked beef, each piece likely weighs around 40-50 grams. There are three pieces, so the total volume and weight add up. Considering some shrinkage due to cooking but the dense nature of beef, the overall estimated weight for the whole brochette is about 130 to 150 grams. Given the medium portion size relative to the plate and other items, I estimate the brochette de boeuf weighs approximately 140 grams."

The image shows a bowl with several food items including chopped tomato, cucumber, shredded carrot, pumpkin seeds, and a white creamy portion which is likely the sérac. The target food item is 'carotte' (carrot). The shredded carrot portion is visible as a heaped pile on one side of the bowl. For dimension analysis, the pile is approximately 7-8 cm long and 4-5 cm wide with a moderate thickness of about 1.5-2 cm. Shredded carrot is dense yet somewhat light compared to cooked vegetables. Estimating volume based on this footprint and thickness gives roughly 50-60 cm³. Given the density of raw carrots is about 0.7 g/cm³, this equates to roughly 35-42 grams. Considering the shredded nature likely includes some air space, the weight should be slightly reduced but overall this matches a small to medium Swiss portion size of shredded carrot. Therefore, I estimate the shredded carrot weight at approximately 38 grams."
wrah5h,pomme,138.0,80,58.0,0.9901039089559623,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/6b584efc-e8bb-46a4-8a19-5e1cc53e7527,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small white container holding several apple slices. The apple is red-skinned and the slices appear to be fairly thick, with visible flesh and peel. There are four distinct pieces visible: one larger piece with peel, two medium pieces with peel, and one smaller piece with a bite taken out. The container gives an approximate reference, appearing to be a small snack box usually around 10-12 cm long, indicating the apple slices cover roughly half the container volume. Considering average Swiss apple sizes and the density of apples, which is about 0.6-0.7 g/cm³, and accounting for the approximate volume and thickness of the slices, a whole apple usually weighs about 150-180g. Here, the slices seem to be roughly half an apple. Taking bite marks and missing flesh into account, I estimate the total visible apple slices weigh approximately 80 grams."
p96w4a,pain,33.0,90,57.0,0.23268184067293418,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/32043e73-8b8d-43a6-b1a0-3cf935affee5,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two slices of bread ('pain') on a plate with spreads. Each slice looks like a small piece of rustic bread, roughly 8-9 cm in diameter and about 2-3 cm thick. The bread has a typical porous structure and crust seen in European bread. A single slice of similar bread usually weighs between 40-50 grams. Since the slices are not very thick but substantial enough, I estimate each slice at around 45 grams. Both slices together would total approximately 90 grams, but since the target is just 'pain' and both slices together are shown, I sum both. Therefore, the total weight of the bread is about 90 grams."
ppf8hc,pâte à tartiner au chocolat,20.0,75,55.0,0.13607125185551708,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/bb3c4df3-02a6-4c3c-ba00-f82398617f07,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'pâte à tartiner au chocolat', which is visible as a spread on three slices of 'tresse au beurre' bread. First, I identify the chocolate spread covering almost the entire surface of the three slice pieces with some partial edges showing the bread. The amount of spread appears uniform with visible lines left by the spreading knife. The bread slices are roughly the size of common sliced bread, approximately 12 cm by 6-7 cm and about 2 cm thick. Considering a moderate layer of chocolate spread at about 2 to 3 millimeters thickness and remembering that chocolate spread (nutella-type) is dense and sticky, density close to about 1.3 g/cm³, the volume of spread can be approximated as surface area times thickness. Each slice surface approx 72-84 cm² (12 x 6-7), three slices total roughly 220-250 cm². Multiply by thickness 0.2-0.3 cm gives volume 44-75 cm³ approx. Multiplying by density 1.3 g/cm³ yields between 57 to 98 grams of chocolate spread. Given the spread is moderate but not very thick or thin, a medium estimate about 75 grams total of 'pâte à tartiner au chocolat' seems reasonable. Depth and density considered, this measure reflects typical serving sizes in Swiss context, excluding any container. Hence, I estimate the weight of the 'pâte à tartiner au chocolat' spread in the image at approximately 75 grams."

The image shows a single serving of mousse au chocolat on a small decorative plate with a standard table fork next to it for scale. The mousse is cylindrical, approximately 6 cm in diameter and about 5-6 cm tall. Considering it is a mousse, the texture is light and airy but still dense enough due to inclusion of chocolate and cream, so the density is moderate. The visible decoration is minimal and does not add significant weight. Comparing to typical Swiss dessert portions, which are usually smaller than US portions, a mousse of this size generally weighs between 110 and 140 grams. Given the thickness, diameter, and mousse density, I estimate this serving to be at the mid to high end of that range, about 130 grams."

The target food item is 'saucisse,' which is located on the left side of the plate. It is a single, grilled sausage approximately the length of a small fork handle, about 10-12 cm long and moderately thick. Compared to the other items on the plate, the sausage is dense and cooked, which increases its weight relative to volume. Swiss portions for sausages tend to be smaller than US portions. Given the sausage size and density, I estimate it to weigh between 70 and 90 grams. Choosing the middle of this range as it looks like a medium portion, the weight estimate is approximately 80 grams."

The target food item is 'fraises' (strawberries) visible in the bowl. In the image, the strawberries are cut into multiple medium-sized pieces and fill the bottom half of a small to medium bowl. I count roughly 15 to 20 pieces, likely from around 5 whole strawberries. Each whole fresh strawberry in Swiss portioning typically weighs about 15 to 20 grams. Since the strawberries are cut and slightly compressed in the bowl, the total volume of pieces suggests a medium portion. Considering the density of strawberries (mostly water, light but compact), and the fact that they are fresh and cut, the total weight range is around 70 to 100 grams. Taking a conservative middle estimate based on visual volume, pieces count, and typical density, I estimate the strawberries weigh approximately 85 grams."
m4egh2,sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon),98.0,145,47.0,0.5697674418604651,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/6b91ac4b-1f0f-4176-bf40-a12a6cd892e2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is the sauce aux champignons, which appears as mushrooms coated in a creamy sauce distributed primarily over the pasta. Step 1: The mushroom pieces are clearly visible and countable, approximately 8 pieces ranging from small to medium-sized. Step 2: Each mushroom piece appears to be sliced and coated with cream. The pieces look dense but not large individually, with an estimated volume equivalent to about 15 to 20 grams per piece, considering mushrooms have moderate density and cream adds some weight but is light. Step 3: Given that the sauce is also likely mixed with garlic and cream, there is a creamy coating facilitating some additional volume but no significant bulk beyond the visible mushrooms. Step 4: Estimating the total weight, assuming 8 pieces averaging about 18 grams each including sauce, which gives 144 grams. The creamy sauce presence adds some volume but is not a separate large portion, so this estimate incorporates the sauce + mushrooms together. Step 5: Given that the serving is medium-sized, I place the weight estimate at the middle range of 130-160 grams. Final estimate: approximately 145 grams of sauce aux champignons contained in the dish."

The target food item is 'brochettes de poulet'. In the image, there is one visible chicken skewer that appears to be grilled. The skewer is approximately the size of a small chicken drumstick or elongated chicken piece on a stick, roughly 12-15 cm long and about 3-4 cm thick. Comparing to the plate and the other items like grilled corn and potato chips, this skewer is a relatively small portion typical of Swiss servings. Chicken meat density is high, so the volume translates to a decent weight. Considering the skewer is mainly chicken breast meat with some seasoning and has been grilled (likely some moisture lost but still dense), a standard small brochette would weigh between 80-100 grams. Given the visual size and thickness but noting it is only one skewer, I estimate a medium portion weight of about 90 grams for this piece of brochettes de poulet."

The image shows one whole kiwi fruit placed on a flat surface without any container. The kiwi is typical in size, roughly fitting comfortably in the palm of an adult hand, which typically corresponds to a medium-sized kiwi. Visually, the kiwi appears uncut and whole, with a fuzzy brown skin intact. Generally, medium-sized kiwis weigh between 70 and 90 grams. Considering the Swiss portion context, which tends to favor smaller or medium portions, and the visual size cues, I estimate this kiwi to weigh around 75 grams."

The image shows a white square plate with a heap of fresh blueberries (myrtilles). I count approximately 45 individual blueberries on the plate. Each blueberry is roughly uniform in size, about 1 to 1.5 cm in diameter, consistent with medium-sized blueberries common in Switzerland. Blueberries have a relatively high water content but are dense compared to leafy vegetables. The typical weight of one medium blueberry is about 1.5 grams. Multiplying 45 blueberries by 1.5 grams gives roughly 67.5 grams. Given the natural variation and slight overlapping that may hide a few berries, I consider a small adjustment, keeping within a medium portion size range. Thus, my estimate for the total weight of the blueberries here is approximately 65 grams."

The target food item is ""épautre cuit"" (cooked spelt), located in the top left section of the glass container. It consists of numerous individual grains, visibly cooked and somewhat swollen. Comparing the size of the grains to the container edge and the scrambled eggs next to it, the volume of the cooked spelt appears roughly equivalent to about 1/3 of the container's base area, with moderate depth. Spelt, a dense cooked grain, weighs approximately 130-140 grams per cooked cup (about 200-220 ml). Considering the container and portion shown is slightly smaller than a standard cup, I estimate between 110 and 130 grams for this portion. Since it looks like a medium portion, I select the middle of this range. Therefore, the estimated weight of the ""épautre cuit"" here is 120 grams."

The image shows one rectangular waffle (gaufre) spread lightly with chocolate spread (pâte à tartiner au chocolat) on a plate. The waffle occupies a central part of a standard-sized plate, which offers a useful size reference. The waffle appears to be about 12 cm by 10 cm in area with a thickness of approximately 1.5 cm. The structure is typical for a waffle, with a light and airy texture but some density from the baked batter. Considering the thickness and size, and the typical density of waffles, a medium-sized square waffle of this dimension usually weighs between 70 to 90 grams. The chocolate spread is thin and patchy, so its added weight is minimal and should not be included here. Therefore, based on visual size, texture, and Swiss portion context (generally smaller), the weight of this single waffle is best estimated at about 80 grams."

The image shows a hand holding half of a green apple ('pomme'), which appears fresh and dense. Comparing the apple half to the hand's size, it looks to be roughly medium-sized for an apple, about 7-8 cm in width and thickness typical for this fruit. Since this is only half of the apple, the total apple is about twice this volume. A medium apple typically weighs between 150 to 180 grams; therefore, the half apple shown should weigh between 75 and 90 grams. Considering the density of apples and its freshness, I estimate the full apple weight to be approximately 160 grams. Since only half is shown, the total apple weight is 160 grams and the visible half is about 80 grams. The target is 'pomme', so the estimated weight is 160 grams."

The target food is 'panais' (parsnip), which is visible as several pale, flesh-colored chunks mixed in with other roasted vegetables on the plate. Step 1: Visually identify and count the pieces — there are roughly 4 to 5 visible pieces of parsnip, irregularly shaped and cut into thick segments averaging about 3-4 cm in length and 1.5-2 cm in width and depth. Step 2: Dimension analysis — compared to the size of the carrot slices and potato chunks on the plate, these parsnip pieces appear compact and dense, with some thickness to them, indicating a non-negligible volume. Given the plate size (standard dinner plate ~26 cm diameter) and the pile depth (~2-3 cm), the cumulative volume of parsnip appears moderate but not overwhelming. Step 3: Density considerations — cooked parsnip is dense and starchy, similar to potato but slightly lighter. Density can be roughly estimated around 0.7-0.8 g/cm3. Step 4: Portion size — in a typical Swiss meal context, the total vegetable portion size on the plate is medium, with the parsnip portion representing about one-quarter to one-third of the mixed vegetables. Step 5: Cross-validation — estimating average piece volume about 10-15 cm3 (thickness x width x length) per piece, times 5 pieces gives 50-75 cm3. Applying density ~0.75 g/cm3 yields roughly 38-56 grams. Considering some visual occlusion and mixing, I assess a conservative estimate of approximately 50 grams for the parsnip portion in this dish."

The target food item is millet, visible on the right side of the plate as a relatively compact, grainy mound. Step 1: The millet occupies roughly half of the plate's surface area on a standard medium-sized rectangular plate. Step 2: The height or depth of the millet is moderate; the grains appear cooked and lightly fluffed, not densely packed but not overly loose either. Step 3: Cooked millet has a density similar to cooked couscous or other small grains, usually about 0.85 to 1.0 g/cm³. Given the volume that appears roughly equivalent to a medium serving of grains (approximately one cup cooked volume, visual approximation), the weight likely falls around 150 to 180 grams. Step 4: Considering Swiss portion sizes tend to be smaller than US, this appears a medium portion rather than a large one, so I lean toward the middle of this range. Step 5: Cross-checking common errors, the grains are visible and not overly piled, so volume is not underestimated. Therefore, I estimate the millet portion to be approximately 165 grams."

The image shows about 14 cut pieces of strawberries (fraises) spread on a small plate. Each piece appears to be roughly a quarter to half of a medium-sized strawberry. A medium whole strawberry typically weighs approximately 15-20 grams. Given these pieces, the total corresponds roughly to about 5-6 whole strawberries in total volume. Considering the density of strawberries and the cut nature, I estimate a total weight range of about 75 to 100 grams. Given the medium portion size visible, the best estimate is approximately 85 grams."

The target food item is 'orange' which is represented on the plate by four visible orange segments. Step 1: Visual Identification - I see four individual orange segments, each fully visible and unhidden on a small plate along with kiwi slices and apple wedges. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Comparing the segments to the apple slices (which generally weigh around 80-100 g for a small apple half) and kiwi slices, the orange segments are smaller in size but plump and thick, suggesting good volume. Each orange segment is about 3-4 cm long and fairly thick, with some visible juiciness. Step 3: Density Considerations - Orange segments are juicy and moderately dense; peeled segments without membrane typically weigh about 20-30 grams per segment depending on size. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given these segments are medium size and a standard Swiss orange weighs approximately 130-150 g whole, four medium segments might represent roughly half an orange. So, each segment is probably about 25 g. Multiplying 4 segments by 25 g gives about 100 g. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The total of 100 g fits well with the visual portion in relation to the plate and other fruits present, and seems reasonable for a peeled, de-membraned orange portion. Therefore, I estimate the orange segments weigh approximately 100 grams in total."

The target food item is a cornet glace noisette (hazelnut ice cream cone). The image shows the entire ice cream cone held in one hand, providing a good scale reference with the fingers holding it. The cone is a standard small wafer cone typical in Swiss portions, about 10-12 cm in length. The scoop of ice cream on top is a modest single scoop with a rounded shape. Hazelnut ice cream is relatively dense due to nuts and cream content. A typical small ice cream cone with one scoop in Switzerland weighs between 90 and 130 grams. Considering the small size of the cone and a moderate amount of ice cream, I estimate a medium portion of about 110 grams total. Subtracting the cone weight of approximately 15-20 grams, the ice cream itself likely weighs around 90-95 grams. Since the target is the full cornet glace noisette, I estimate approximately 110 grams in total for the ice cream cone portion shown."

The image shows a metal container holding two pieces of flatbread or galette, with one piece partly rolled or folded and the other piece partially torn open to reveal the filling. The galette appears to be approximately the size of a typical small flatbread, roughly 15-18 cm in length and about 10-12 cm in width. Comparing it to the container size, the thickness of the galette is quite thin, around 2-3 mm, consistent with flatbread or lavash type bread. Considering Swiss portion context, where portions tend to be smaller than US sizes, the total weight would be less than larger wraps or flatbreads. Flatbreads and galettes are moderately dense due to their flour content, but very thin. A full single galette of this size weighs roughly 80 grams on average according to typical food composition references. Since two pieces are present, but one is partial or torn, we estimate around 1.5 galettes total visually. Given that, the total weight would be approximately 120 grams. Since the target food is pain/galette, I estimate the visible portion weight including the two pieces together to be about 120 grams."

The image shows one single banana placed on a chair cushion, which provides a sense of scale. The banana appears to be of medium size, typical for Swiss portion sizes, with an estimated length of around 15 to 18 cm. Bananas are dense fruits, so the weight is quite substantial relative to their size. A medium banana usually weighs around 120 to 150 grams including the peel. Given the visual evidence, this banana looks like a medium one rather than a small or large variety. Hence, I estimate the weight of this banana to be approximately 130 grams."

The image shows a slice of bread with caviar d'aubergines spread on top, placed on a plate. The piece of bread is roughly 10 cm long by about 5 cm wide, with an average thickness of about 2.5 cm. The caviar d'aubergines covers the entire top surface of the bread slice, with an average layer thickness of approximately 1 cm. Eggplant caviar has a somewhat moist but dense texture, similar to cooked vegetables, so density is moderate. The bread piece itself is porous and lighter, but we're only estimating the caviar portion, excluding the bread. Based on surface area (about 50 cm²) and depth (1 cm), the volume is approximately 50 cm³. Considering the density of cooked eggplant mixture around 0.8 grams/cm³ due to moisture content, the caviar d'aubergines weighs roughly 40 grams. Therefore, I estimate the weight of caviar d'aubergines to be approximately 40 grams."

The image shows a purple bowl with three main visible components: French green flat beans (haricots coco), cooked pearl wheat (perle de blé) mixed with shrimp (crevettes) in a yellow saffron cream sauce. The target food is 'perle de blé'. Visually, the pearl wheat is clustered mainly beneath and around the shrimp, covering approximately half of the bowl's visible base. The pearls appear moist, coated with sauce, causing them to clump together and hide some quantity underneath. A typical medium portion for pearl wheat in a Swiss context is around 100-130 grams cooked per serving. Here, given the bowl size compared to the beans and the shrimp portion, the pearl wheat portion occupies a medium volume, somewhat thick but not overly dense, and occupies about 40-50% of the bowl base. Considering the yellow sauce adds some moisture weight but should not overly add to grain weight, I estimate a medium portion of approximately 110 grams of cooked pearl wheat. The depth and density correspond well with this estimate while avoiding overestimation due to sauce presence."

The target food item is 'salade'. Visually, the salade occupies roughly one third of a standard medium-sized plate. It consists of loose green leaves, likely lettuce, which are light in density and volume. The leaves appear fresh and slightly piled, with some sunflower seeds scattered on top. Considering the size relative to the plate (approximately 15-18 cm diameter) and the leafy nature, the depth of the salad is not very thick, probably around 2-3 cm on average. Leafy salads are light, so weight is less than volume alone might suggest. For a Swiss portion context, this looks like a small to medium side salad portion. Typically, such a salad weighs between 40 and 70 grams. Given the visible density, size, and components, I estimate the salade weight at about 55 grams."

The target food is 'confiture de coing' (quince jam), which is visibly spread on two slices of bread. Visually, the jam covers most of the upper surface of each slice but is not very thick, with a translucent, gel-like consistency typical of fruit preserves. Each slice appears to have roughly 10-15 grams of jam spread across it when considering the surface area and the standard thin spread thickness. Because there are two slices, the total amount of jam should be about 20-30 grams. Given the moderate spread and typical density of fruit jam (close to water but slightly heavier), I estimate a medium portion weight around 25 grams for the confiture de coing."

The target food item is 'boeuf' visible on the skewer at the top right of the plate. Step 1: Visually identify the boeuf skewer, which has approximately 6-7 bite-sized pieces of grilled beef threaded lengthwise. Step 2: Dimension analysis shows the skewer is about 12-14 cm long with each piece roughly 2 cm thick and 3-4 cm wide. Considering the beef pieces are dense meat chunks with visible grill marks, the pieces seem compact. Step 3: Based on density, cooked beef averages about 1 gram per cubic cm; each piece estimated roughly 3x2x2 = 12 cm³, multiplied by 6 pieces gives around 72 cm³, so approximately 70-75 grams. Step 4: Portion size calibration within Swiss standards looks like a small to medium portion; taking the middle range. Step 5: Cross-validation considering meat density and portion size suggests an estimate near 72 grams. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'boeuf' skewer to be around 72 grams."

The image shows two slices of toasted bread on a plate; the target food item is 'toast'. Both slices are clearly visible in full and are uniform square-shaped portions, typical of standard sandwich bread. Each piece appears to be around 10 cm by 10 cm in size, with a thickness of roughly 1.5 cm, consistent with thin toasts common in Swiss portions. Toasted bread loses some moisture but maintains similar density to regular bread. A standard slice of toast bread is usually around 30-35 grams. Given these are average slices, not particularly thick or thin, I estimate each slice at approximately 32 grams. Since the prompt does not specify whether to estimate one slice or both, I will provide the weight for one slice only, as the input text is singular 'toast'. Therefore, I estimate the weight of one slice of toast as 32 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing quinoa, asparagus, and a piece of salmon. The quinoa occupies roughly half of the bowl's visible volume, appearing fluffy but compact. Comparing the quinoa to the asparagus spears and salmon piece, the quinoa layer is about 2-3 cm deep across the area it covers. Cooked quinoa is dense but lighter than cooked grains like rice or pasta. A typical small bowl serving of cooked quinoa ranges from about 100 to 150 grams. Given the Swiss portion context and the visible quantity, this portion of quinoa seems medium-sized. Considering the volume and density, I estimate the quinoa weight around 130 grams, balancing the fluffiness and the area it covers in the bowl."

The image shows two slices of bread ('pain') on a small square glass plate. Each slice is relatively thick, with a porous, airy crumb structure, typical of Swiss-style white bread. The slices appear roughly 12 cm long, about 5 cm wide at the broadest point, and approximately 2 cm thick. Given the porous texture, the density is moderate, not very dense. Considering Swiss portions tend to be smaller than US ones, the total volume of these two slices corresponds to a medium portion of bread. A typical slice of similar bread weighs around 40-50 grams, so for two slices, the weight would be approximately 80-100 grams. Taking into account that the bread appears slightly thick but not overly large, I estimate the total weight of the 'pain' to be about 90 grams."

The target food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries), which appear at the bottom right of the plate, alongside raspberries and next to the oat mixture with chia seeds, peanut butter, and chocolate chips. There are 5 visible blueberries, medium-sized and round. Given that an average blueberry weighs approximately 1.5 to 2 grams, and considering Swiss portions tend to be smaller, I will use the lower to middle range. The blueberries are fresh and whole, so the full weight counts. Therefore, 5 blueberries × ~1.8g each equals roughly 9 grams total."

They measure approximately 8-9 cm in length, 3-4 cm in width, and appear about 1.5-2 cm thick. Breaded fish is dense due to the fish and coating but lighter than pure meat because of the batter. Comparing the size to the standard dinner plate (about 24 cm diameter), each piece looks like a small portion typical of Swiss servings. Average weight of a single piece of breaded fish of this size is about 50 grams. Three pieces would be roughly 150 grams in total. Considering the density, slight variations in size, and the Swiss portion context, a medium total weight estimate is about 150 grams for the three pieces shown."

The target food is 'pâtes' (pasta), which is the right side portion of the meal in the metal container. Visually, the pasta is fusilli with tomato sauce and topped with grated parmesan. The portion covers roughly one third of the container's floor surface and is moderately piled. Comparing the pasta to the adjacent chicken strips (around 10-12 cm each), the pasta pile has a depth of about 2-3 cm. Pasta cooked with sauce has a dense texture, so each portion of this visible size typically weighs more than it appears volumetrically. Considering Swiss portion sizes that tend to be moderate, the pasta portion appears medium-sized. Standard medium cooked pasta servings are around 120-150g, but with sauce and parmesan, the density may increase weight slightly. After discounting the parmesan layer on top (which is separately estimated), the pasta alone likely weighs near 130 grams, a reasonable medium portion without overestimation."

The image shows a single slice of gâteau au fromage blanc on a white plate. The slice is about the size of a small to medium dessert portion, roughly triangular with a base approximately 7 cm wide and a height around 4 cm. The thickness of the slice seems to be about 2.5 cm, which is typical for a cheesecake slice. The cake density is moderately dense due to the cheese content but softer than solid cake. Cheesecake density typically ranges around 1 g/cm³. Using these dimensions, the volume is approximately 7 x 4 x 2.5 / 2 = 35 cm³ (since it's a slice roughly triangular in base). At about 1 g/cm³, this gives 35 grams. However, considering moisture and density can fluctuate, and the slice looks reasonably thick and moist, the weight likely ranges between 40-50 grams, closer to 45 grams for a medium portion. Thus, I estimate the slice weight at about 45 grams."

The target food, 'sauce tomate,' appears mixed with tagliatelles and sprinkled with grated gruyère cheese in a rectangular metal container. The sauce is primarily visible on and beneath the pasta, covering much of the right side and some parts underneath. The volume of visible sauce extends roughly over half of the container’s base area, with an estimated depth around 0.5 to 1 cm considering some sauce is beneath the pasta. Tomato sauce is moderately dense, closer to water density but slightly thicker, so approximately 1 g/cm³. Given the container appears medium-sized (approximate base dimensions around 15 cm x 9 cm) and the sauce covers an estimated 60% of this area at an average thickness between 0.5 and 1 cm, the total volume approximates 68 - 135 cm³, equivalent to 68 - 135 grams. Considering the visual portion size and a medium portion estimate for Swiss context, I choose a weight near the middle of this range, around 100 grams of sauce tomate in this dish."

Given the portion size and comparing the slices to the scoop of ice cream (which is a standard small scoop about 50-60 grams), the total strawberry weight should be less but still substantial. Slices appear fresh and sizable but not overly thick. Considering typical portion sizes and Swiss context which tends to be more moderate, I estimate each slice weighs about 8-10 grams. Multiplying by the 8 slices gives a range of approximately 64-80 grams. Factoring in some hidden or overlapping slices and moisture density, I estimate a medium portion weight, around 70 grams for the strawberries."

Considering the light and porous nature of the chips, the weight per volume is low. Typical similar puffed snacks weigh approximately 0.3 to 0.5 grams per chip, and there appear to be around 25-30 pieces in the bowl. Multiplying the estimated number of pieces by the average weight per chip, and considering some pieces may be partially hidden or overlapping, the total weight likely ranges between 8 and 14 grams.

Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each duck breast slice seems approximately 7-8 cm long and about 3-4 cm wide, with an estimated thickness of about 1.5 to 2 cm. The pieces have some visible fat and skin layer, typical of duck breast. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cooked duck breast is dense meat with an estimated density close to other cooked meats (~1 g/cm3). Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Typical Swiss portions for duck breast filets are smaller than US sizes. Each piece looks like a modest portion. A usual duck breast filet piece in Switzerland is about 70-90 grams. Given two slices that look like parts of one full filet, the total weight is likely around 90-100 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The plate size (approximately 24 cm diameter) confirms the relative size of the filet pieces and supports this estimation range. Thus, I estimate the total weight of the 'filet de canard' on this plate to be approximately 95 grams."

The image shows a bowl containing milk with a modest amount of cereals floating on top. Visually, the cereals cover only a thin layer at the surface and do not fill the bowl significantly. Considering that typical breakfast cereal portions in Swiss context are smaller than US portions, and the bowl size appears to be standard (around 12-15 cm diameter), the cereals seem to weigh less than a half cup. Taking into account that dry cereals are light but compact, the volume corresponds roughly to 25-35 grams. Milk weight is excluded as per instructions. Therefore, by visual assessment and density considerations, I estimate the cereals in this bowl to weigh approximately 30 grams."

The image shows a small white bowl containing a mixed salad with visible ingredients, including tomato pieces. The tomatoes are cut into small chunks, roughly 8-10 pieces visible. Comparing the tomato size to the bowl and surrounding items, each piece seems to be about 2-3 cm wide, consistent with fresh tomato chunks. Tomatoes are moderately dense with high water content, so their weight per volume is moderate. The total volume of tomato pieces in the bowl looks to be about 100-120 ml. Given that 1 ml of tomato roughly equals 1 gram, the total estimated weight of tomato pieces is around 100-120 grams. Considering it's a Swiss portion and the bowl is not overly full, a conservative estimate is approximately 110 grams of tomato."

The plate shows a portion of white rice on the upper left side next to eggs and ratatouille. The rice portion appears to be about a small heaping serving, roughly half the size of a typical medium rice bowl serving. The rice grains are fluffy and not overly compacted but piled somewhat thickly, suggesting a depth of about 2-3 cm. Using the plate diameter as a reference (standard plate about 25 cm), the rice occupies roughly a quarter of the plate surface area. Given that cooked white rice has a density close to 130-150 g per cup, and considering Swiss portions smaller than US ones, this serving looks to be about 120 to 140 grams. I estimate it conservatively at 130 grams to account for the moderate portion size and fluffiness."

The image shows one single piece of brownie with visible chunks of walnut embedded inside. The brownie piece is placed on a napkin, which gives a rough size reference. The brownie appears to be about 5 cm by 4 cm in surface area, with an estimated thickness of around 2.5 cm, judging from the visible edges and the texture. Brownies are dense due to chocolate and nuts, so the volume correlates well with weight. Given the density of such baked goods (roughly 1.1 g/cm³ to 1.3 g/cm³), and estimating the volume at about 50 cubic cm (5x4x2.5 cm), the weight should be around 55-65 grams. Considering the walnut pieces add some weight but no significant volume, a middle value of 60 grams is reasonable. Therefore, the estimated weight of the brownie chocolat noir noix is 60 grams."

The image shows a rectangular metal container with a variety of foods: quinoa, mango cubes, beetroot chunks, grated carrots, tomato slices, tofu seasoned with mango, shallots, green onion, and sliced avocado. The avocado is located on the left-center of the container, cut into about 4 medium-sized slices. Comparing the avocado slices to the adjacent tofu cubes and tomato slices, the avocado pieces appear fairly thick and dense, likely close to the average size of half a medium avocado. A medium avocado typically weighs about 150 grams total, with the edible portion around 130 grams. These four slices appear to represent roughly half the avocado, since the pit/core is not visible and the pieces fill about half of the left-center quadrant of the container. Given the visual size and thickness of the avocado pieces and relating to the Swiss portion context where portions are smaller, I estimate the avocado portion shown weighs about 60 to 70 grams. Taking a median value within that range, the most reasonable estimate is approximately 65 grams."

The target food is mozzarella. In the image, the mozzarella is cut into irregular pieces, loosely scattered on the top portion of the container. The container appears to be a standard small meal prep box, roughly 15 cm by 10 cm based on common container sizes. The mozzarella pieces cover about one-third of the container surface, with an estimated thickness of 1.5 to 2 cm given the chunkiness and visible height of pieces. Mozzarella is a dense cheese but softer than hard cheeses. Typical density and portion sizes suggest that a slice of mozzarella of this size (roughly equivalent to a small ball of mozzarella torn apart) weighs approximately 60 to 90 grams. Considering Swiss portion size standards, this looks like a medium portion leaning towards a smaller serving. Therefore, I estimate the mozzarella weight to be about 75 grams."

The image shows two slices of gâche spread with chocolate paste, but the estimation is only for the gâche itself. Gâche is a type of brioche-like bread typical in Switzerland and France, generally denser than regular sliced sandwich bread but softer than a heavy loaf. Each slice in the image appears to be roughly the size of a standard slice of bread—about 10 cm by 10 cm—and about 2 cm thick. The thickness and density of gâche bread suggest a weight between 40 and 60 grams per slice. Since there are two slices visible, I must carefully consider the weight per slice, focusing on just one whole slice as the target food. Based on the size comparison to the glass and keys nearby, each slice weighs around 50 grams. Therefore, for a single slice of gâche, I estimate the weight to be 50 grams."

The target food item is œuf au plat (fried eggs). In the image, there are two fried eggs visible on the plate. Each œuf au plat is a typical size of a large egg, roughly 50g raw before cooking. Cooking changes mostly water content, but the weight remains near the original raw egg weight minus minimal moisture loss. Considering Swiss portion control and that the eggs are cooked sunny side up with minimal oil, each œuf au plat likely weighs close to 45-50 grams. With two eggs present, total weight estimate ranges between 90 to 100 grams. To be precise and slightly conservative, I estimate the total weight of the two œufs au plat at about 95 grams."

The target food item is 'yaourt nature' (plain yogurt). Visually, the yogurt is in a typical small plastic pot, open and filled to the top. These yogurt pots commonly found in Switzerland generally contain around 125 grams to 150 grams of yogurt. Comparing the size of the yogurt pot to the apple next to it, the pot seems standard-sized for a single serving. The depth and width suggest a volume consistent with a 125g to 150g portion. Swiss portions tend to be slightly smaller than American ones, so I lean towards the lower-middle of this range. Considering visual evidence and typical packaging, I estimate the weight of the 'yaourt nature' to be approximately 130 grams."

The target food item is 'œuf', which is visible as a single fried egg on the plate. The egg occupies roughly a third of the plate's flat surface and looks like a standard medium-sized egg, considering the overall plate size and portion context. The egg white appears cooked through with no extra thick layering, and the yolk is intact, suggesting an average volume for a fried egg. In Swiss portion context, a medium egg typically weighs about 50 grams when cooked this way (fried with minimal oil). There are no additional eggs visible, and no parts are missing. Hence, I estimate the weight of this cooked œuf to be 50 grams."

The target food item is 'pain' (bread). Visually, there is one piece of bread located at the bottom of the plate. It appears to be a bite-size chunk torn from a baguette-style bread. Considering the size relative to the other items on the plate, the bread piece is about 5 cm long, 4 cm wide, and 3-4 cm thick. Typical density for crusty bread like a baguette is around 250-300 g per 1000 cm³. The volume of this piece is roughly estimated as 5 cm × 4 cm × 3.5 cm = 70 cm³. Multiplying volume by density 0.25 g/cm³ gives an approximate weight of 17.5 grams. Considering potential air pockets inside baguette bread and the slightly uneven shape, this estimation could have an error margin of around ±4 grams. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for this bread piece is about 18 grams."

The target food item is 'pâte à tartiner au chocolat' visible spread over two triangular slices of pain au céréales. Visually, the chocolate spread appears to be thinly but evenly layered on the bread slices. The spread does not look overly thick, just enough to cover the surface. The combined surface area covered is roughly equivalent to two medium-sized triangular bread slices, about 15 cm in length and 6-7 cm at the widest part. Considering the spread's thickness to be approximately 2-3 mm, and the density of chocolate spread being relatively high (around 1.2 g/cm³), the total volume translates to a moderate amount. Estimated volume is approximately 25-30 cm² surface area × 0.2-0.3 cm thickness = about 5-9 cm³ of spread, equating to roughly 6-11 grams. Given the spread is not thick and adheres mostly to the bread surface, I estimate the combined weight of the chocolate spread to be around 8 grams, which is a realistic medium portion for such visual coverage."

The target food is 'salade de céleri', which is located at the bottom-right of the plate, appearing as a small mound of finely shredded white celery salad. For size reference, the white square plate is similar to a standard lunch plate (around 23 cm wide). The salade de céleri portion is roughly a dense heap about 6 cm wide x 4 cm deep (front to back) and about 2-3 cm in height. Celery root salad has moderate density, denser than leafy vegetables but lighter than dense meats. Given the carefully contained portion size, this is a small to medium Swiss portion typical for a side salad. Considering these factors, I estimate the weight of this celery salad portion to be around 60 grams."

Focusing only on the riz basmati, it forms a modest mound roughly 8-10 cm wide and about 3-4 cm deep in thickness. Comparing the rice to the chicken pieces and plate size, the rice portion is compact but not heaped. Cooked basmati rice is dense and weighs approximately 130-150 grams per cup (about 200-220 ml volume). The portion here appears to be about half a cup to three-quarters of a cup. Given the Swiss portion context, which tends to be smaller than US standards, and the visible size and density, the rice portion is reasonably estimated between 90 and 110 grams. Selecting a median value conservatively, the estimated weight is around 100 grams."

The fromage (etivaz) is the rectangular yellow cheese piece placed vertically to the left side of the plate next to the baguette slice. It is a dense semi-hard cheese and visually about 7 cm long, 2 cm wide, and 1.5 cm thick. Given the typical density of semi-hard cheese (~1.1 g/cm³), and the approximate volume of around 21 cm³ (7x2x1.5), the estimated weight is approximately 23 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes, this is a medium slice, so no adjustment up or down is needed. Therefore, the estimated weight of the fromage (etivaz) is 23 grams."

Each galette appears thicker than but roughly similar in diameter to a typical small palm-sized veggie patty, about 7-8 cm across and about 1.5-2 cm thick. Given their grain and legume composition, they are moderately dense. Typical homemade millet and bean patties of this size usually weigh between 60-80 grams each. For three patties, the total weight range is approximately 180-240 grams. The portion size in the image appears moderate rather than large. Therefore, estimating towards the middle of this range seems reasonable. I estimate the total weight of the galettes millet haricots noirs maïs to be about 210 grams."

The séré maigre fills a substantial part of the bowl, which appears to be a small dessert bowl roughly 12 cm in diameter. The séré maigre layer is relatively thick, about 3-4 cm deep, appearing dense and creamy but light compared to heavier dairy products. Given the bowl size and the amount visible, the séré maigre quantity seems to be a moderate single-serving portion. Fresh cheese products like séré maigre have a density close to yogurt, about 1 g/ml. Estimating the séré maigre volume as roughly 100-120 ml, the corresponding weight would be approximately 100-120 grams. Since it looks like a medium portion without any visible extra or small serving size, I choose the midpoint of 110 grams as a reasonable estimate for the séré maigre in this bowl."

The image shows one slice of rhubarb tart (tarte à la rhubarbe) on a white plate, alongside a knife and fork which help gauge its size. The slice appears to be about one eighth of a typical tart, roughly 12 cm long on the outer crust. The tart's filling of rhubarb pieces is distributed evenly and the tart has a visible crust thickness around 0.5 cm. Considering the rhubarb is cooked and embedded in a custard-like filling, the density is moderate, with rhubarb pieces being fibrous but softened by cooking. The crust adds bulk but not excessive weight. A whole tart of this size typically weighs about 700-800 grams; one eighth would be about 87-100 grams. Given the slice's visible thickness and amount of filling, I assess it closer to the lower middle of that range, estimating around 95 grams for this slice of tarte à la rhubarbe."

The apple appears to be medium-sized by Swiss standards, neither very small nor very large. Compared to the hand, the apple has an approximate diameter of about 7-8 cm. Apples have a density generally close to water but slightly less dense due to air spaces, so the weight roughly corresponds to volume. A medium apple of this size typically weighs between 130 and 180 grams. Considering the apple’s visible plumpness and size, I estimate it is around the middle to upper middle of this range. Therefore, the estimated weight of the apple is approximately 160 grams."

The image shows a black bowl containing a portion of salade verte (green salad), which consists mainly of loose leafy greens. The leaves appear fresh and somewhat compacted, but salad greens are generally very light in weight. The bowl size compared to the nearby tortilla on a plate suggests a small-medium portion. Leafy greens like lettuce typically weigh about 10-15 grams per handful. Here, the salad looks like roughly two handfuls or one small bowl serving. Considering the volume, visible layering, and the low density of leafy salad, the estimated weight should be around 25-35 grams.

The asparagus spear is medium-sized, approximately 10-12 cm long judging by comparison to the cherry tomatoes and the size of the rice grains. The thickness appears typical for asparagus stalks, around 1.5-2 cm in diameter. Considering that cooked asparagus tends to weigh about 15-20 grams per 10 cm spear, and estimating the visible spear to be a single full piece, the weight is likely around 15 grams. Given there are no additional asparagus spears visible, and no indication of hidden pieces, I estimate the weight of the asparagus on this plate to be approximately 15 grams."

The soufflé au fromage is located on the right side of the plate and appears as a puffed, somewhat browned, and unevenly textured portion. Its volume is roughly one-third of the plate. Comparing it to the rice and ratatouille portions and considering that soufflé is a light, airy dish, the density is low, so its volume is relatively large for its weight. Given the size of the plate (standard small dinner plate of about 22 cm diameter) and the visible height and spread of the soufflé (roughly 6-7 cm thick and about 10 cm wide), I estimate its volume as moderate. Considering Swiss portion sizes tend to be smaller, I estimate a medium portion weight roughly between 130-170 grams.

The tartelette aux chocolats is the target food. It appears as half a small tart, about 7-8 cm long and 4 cm wide, with a thick chocolate cream and topping. Considering the thickness (around 2-3 cm) and the dense chocolate filling, the chocolate tart is a dense dessert. The crust base adds to the weight while being moderately dense. A whole small tartlette of this size typically weighs around 90-110 grams. Since this is half the tart, the estimated weight should be about half that, approximately 45-55 grams.

The pasta mound is about 10-12 cm long and about 6 cm wide in area covered by parmesan, with the cheese height being minimal, about 2-3 mm in thickness. Grated parmesan is dense but light when grated finely. Estimating the volume of parmesan as approximately 10 cm x 6 cm x 0.3 cm = 18 cm3. Parmesan density is roughly around 1.1 g/cm3, so the weight is around 18 to 20 grams. Given the relatively light sprinkle and some variance, I estimate this portion of parmesan to weigh about 18 grams."

The image shows two churros placed on a flat surface. For step 1, I count exactly two churros. They appear fried, coated with sugar, and are traditionally hollow or slightly airy inside, which affects density. For step 2, I estimate the length of each churro in relation to common hand-sized dimensions; the longer churro is about 15-16 cm and the shorter one about 12 cm. The diameter of each churro is about 2 cm. Considering the typical thickness and hollow structure, this gives a moderate volume. For step 3, churros are based on fried dough, which is relatively dense but not as heavy as solid meat or cheese. Each churro's density is moderate due to frying, so weight per centimeter is lower than solid dough. For step 4, typical churros in this size range weigh approximately 25-30 grams each. Given the two pieces, one slightly larger than the other, I estimate the first churro weighs around 30 grams and the smaller around 23 grams. Adding them gives about 53 grams total. Considering some sugar coating and possible slight variations, an overall estimate of 50 grams for the two churros combined is reasonable and consistent with Swiss portion sizes, which tend to be smaller. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the churros shown as 50 grams total."

The image shows a single small feuilleté with tomato sauce. Step 1: The target food item is one feuilleté; only one piece is visible. Step 2: Dimension analysis indicates this puff pastry piece is about 3-4 cm wide and about 2-3 cm thick, roughly the size of a small mini appetiser or snack-sized pastry. The tomato sauce is visible as a thin layer inside the pastry and on top. Step 3: Considering the density of puff pastry (light but layered with butter) and the tomato sauce (which adds some moisture and weight but is light overall), the item is moderately dense. Step 4: For a Swiss portion of a small feuilleté snack, typical weights range between 20 g and 35 g. Because this appears to be a small individual piece with visible slight charring and puffed layers, it is closer to the lower-middle of that range. Step 5: Cross-validation confirms that single small savory puff pastries usually weigh around 25 to 30 grams in this context. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this feuilleté sauce tomate to be approximately 28 grams."

The image shows one peeled carrot placed on a textured surface. The carrot is whole, uncut, and fully visible, allowing for an accurate size estimation. Comparing the carrot to the texture size of the granite or similar kitchen counter, the carrot appears medium-sized, about 15-18 cm in length and about 3-4 cm in diameter at the thickest part. Carrots peeled tend to be denser and slightly lighter than unpeeled but close in weight. A medium peeled carrot of this size typically weighs between 80 and 120 grams. Given the visual thickness and length, I estimate the weight toward the middle of this range for a medium-sized peeled carrot, approximately 100 grams."

The target food item is 'mayonnaise thomy,' which is visually identified as the dollop of creamy white substance on the plate at the upper left side next to the asparagus. The mayo portion is roughly the size of a heaping tablespoon, about 3-4 cm across and about 1.5-2 cm in height. Mayonnaise is dense but light compared to solid foods, typically around 0.9 g/cm³ in density. Given the visible volume approximates about 15-20 milliliters (considering some unsupported volume inside the small mound), the weight should be close to 14-18 grams. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes and the thickness of this dollop, I estimate the mayonnaise thomy weight to be about 16 grams."

The target food is 'haricots rouges' (red kidney beans), located on the left side of the plate. These beans are clearly visible as whole cooked beans, coated lightly with seasoning or sauce with some herbs. Counting the visible beans, there are approximately 25-30 beans clustered, though some may be slightly obscured underneath. Visually, the portion is modest, covering less than a quarter of the plate's surface. Comparing the beans to the fusilli pasta and the plate’s size (standard dinner plate ~25 cm diameter), each bean weighs roughly 1 gram when cooked. Factor in the density of cooked kidney beans, which is relatively high due to hydration but less dense than dry beans. The total portion appears to be medium-sized but not large. Considering depth and slight piling up, I estimate a total weight range for the haricots rouges of about 80-110 grams. Taking the middle value to be more accurate, my final estimate is 95 grams."

The target food item is 'graine de tournesol' (sunflower seeds). They are sprinkled visibly over the leafy salad portion on the plate. The seeds are small but numerous, scattered in a thin but noticeable layer across the leaves. Given the plate size (standard dinner plate ~25 cm diameter), the salad portion is moderate, and the sunflower seeds layer is light but not sparse. Sunflower seeds are dense and small, with about 7 grams per tablespoon (roughly a small handful). Visually, the seeds appear to cover less than a full tablespoon, closer to half to three-quarters of a tablespoon. Considering visual coverage and density, I estimate the sunflower seeds weigh around 4-5 grams. Choosing a middle-range weight for this small but noticeable portion, I estimate approximately 5 grams of sunflower seeds on the salad."

The target food item is ""banane"" visible on the left side of the plate. The banana appears to be about half of a standard medium banana portion, based on its length relative to the plate size and the other foods. A typical medium banana weighs approximately 120-130 grams in total. Since this is roughly half, the visible banana piece should weigh about 60-65 grams. The banana is peeled, so the entire mass is edible fruit, with no skin weight to subtract. Considering the Swiss portion context and the visual thickness and length of this banana piece, I estimate the weight of this banana portion to be 63 grams."

The target food item is 'oeuf au plat' which is a fried egg. Visually, the egg is fully visible on the plate with its white and yolk clearly identifiable. The egg takes a moderate portion of the plate and is seasoned with pepper and paprika. Comparing to the cutlery and the other items on the plate, the size corresponds closely to a standard medium egg, typical in Swiss portions. A medium fried egg without shell weighs approximately 50 grams. There is no visible additional cooking fat volume included, so container or excess oil weight is excluded. All visual evidence supports that this is a single medium fried egg portion. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'oeuf au plat' to be about 50 grams."

The image shows a hand holding a small handful of cashew nuts ('noix de cajou'). I count approximately 14 individual cashew nuts, all of average size. Each cashew nut typically weighs around 1.5 to 2 grams, considering their density as a dense nut. The nuts appear whole and not broken or fragmented, so each piece is contributing fully to the weight. Multiplying 14 nuts by an average of 1.7 grams per nut gives an estimated total weight of about 24 grams. Given this is a moderate portion with no visible extra nuts or gaps, I estimate the total weight to be approximately 24 grams."

The image shows one cookie placed on a granite surface, which provides a rough size reference. The cookie appears to be a typical homemade chocolate chip cookie, roughly around 7-8 cm in diameter. Its thickness is moderate, about 1-1.5 cm, and it contains visible chocolate chunks. Considering the density of baked cookies, which are fairly dense due to sugar, butter, and flour content, the weight is likely more than a very light cookie but less than a dense cake-like item. Typical chocolate chip cookies of this size generally weigh between 40 to 60 grams. Given the visual thickness and the distribution of chocolate chips, I estimate this cookie to be a medium-sized portion around 50 grams."

The image shows a plate with four long slices of roasted aubergine, several tomato wedges, scrambled eggs, and a pile of grated parmesan cheese sprinkled over the eggs. The target food is 'parmesan,' which appears as a shredded, loose pile on top of the scrambled eggs. Visually, the parmesan covers a moderate surface area but is not densely packed. Comparing the size of the parmesan pile to the eggs and tomato slices around it, the parmesan layer appears to be about 1 to 2 cm thick at the thickest spots, spread thinly over approximately 1/5 of the plate surface. Parmesan is a dense cheese, so even a small volume corresponds to a notable weight. Based on typical parmesan grated cheese density and typical serving sizes, this looks like a small to medium garnish portion. I estimate a weight range of 10-15 grams and select approximately 13 grams considering the thickness and spread."

The image shows two boiled eggs on a plate with other food items. Each egg appears to be a standard medium-sized boiled egg. Medium-sized boiled eggs typically weigh between 50 and 60 grams each without shell. Both eggs are whole and intact. Therefore, the total weight of the two eggs combined is roughly 100 to 120 grams. Since the request is for the weight of 'oeufs' (plural eggs), assuming the two eggs visible are the total serving, the estimated weight is about 110 grams, representing a medium portion size for two medium-sized boiled eggs."

The target food item is 'sauce à salade'. Visually, the image shows a plate with a mixed salad including rice, cherry tomatoes, peach, corn, asparagus, tuna, kidney beans, and boiled egg. However, there is no visible amount of liquid salad dressing or sauce pooling on the plate or soaked visibly into the salad components. The salad looks mostly dry, with no shiny or wet areas that would indicate a notable quantity of sauce. If the sauce were present, typical Swiss portions for salad dressing are relatively small, generally around 10-20 grams for a single serving on such a plate. Given the visual evidence, it appears the amount is minimal or possibly none. Therefore, I estimate a small to negligible amount of sauce à salade, around 10 grams, to be a reasonable and conservative estimate based on typical Swiss portion size for salad dressing in such a dish."

The image shows three pieces of seeded bread ('pain') placed on a kitchen scale. Each slice is about the size of a typical small bread slice, appearing to be rustic or wholegrain with visible seeds on the crust. The pieces are of uneven shape but roughly similar volume. Typical Swiss smaller bread slices weigh around 30-40 grams each. Given the thickness and density of the bread, and considering the three slices together, I estimate each slice weighs approximately 35 grams on average. Therefore, the total weight for the 'pain' visible in the image is roughly 3 slices × 35 grams = 105 grams. Considering possible slight variations, I place the estimate at 105 grams for the visible bread pieces only, excluding any spread or container weight."

The image shows two small chocolate bunnies on a flat surface. Each bunny appears to be solid milk chocolate and shaped with some thickness, small enough to hold in one hand easily. Comparing with the texture of the table and visible weave of the placemat in the background, each bunny is estimated to be about 4-5 cm tall and roughly 2.5-3 cm in width and depth. Given typical milk chocolate density and similar shaped chocolates, a single bunny of this small size weighs approximately between 20 and 30 grams. Since the target is one 'chocolat' piece, I estimate the weight of one chocolate bunny to be about 25 grams based on its compact size and thickness."

The image shows two rectangular pieces of dark chocolate branded 'Cailler', which is a known Swiss chocolate brand. Each piece is about 3-4 cm wide and approximately 1 cm thick, judging by the surface texture and comparison to the wood grain underneath as a scale reference. The pieces are standard bars, moderately thick and dense, typical for dark chocolate. Given the average density and size of such chocolate segments, each piece likely weighs around 10 to 12 grams. Since there are two pieces present, the total weight should be approximately 20 to 24 grams. Taking a conservative estimate aligned with Swiss portion sizes and the visual scale, I estimate the weight of the 'chocolat noir crémant' shown to be about 22 grams."

The target food is 'oignons nouveaux' visible in thin circular slices scattered on the tomato and mozzarella stack and in the salad. I identify around 6 to 7 visible slices of oignons nouveaux in total. Each slice is thin with a diameter of roughly 2.5-3 cm. Oignons nouveaux are light and low-density vegetables, so each thin slice roughly weighs about 1 to 2 grams considering their water content and thinness. Given 6 to 7 slices, the total weight will be approximately 7 to 12 grams. Considering the visible quantity and that some slices might be partially hidden or overlapped, a conservative, medium portion estimate would be about 9 grams of oignons nouveaux without any container weight."

By comparing to the wood grain of the table, typical dimensions of such a cracker are about 7-8 cm length and 5 cm width, with each cracker being quite thin—likely around 3-4 mm in thickness. These crackers are dense, containing grains and pumpkin seeds, which adds to their weight despite their thinness. From known nutritional data, a single Blévita cracker of this type usually weighs about 10 grams each. Since there are four crackers stacked, the cumulative weight should be around 40 grams. Considering the density and visible thickness closely, I estimate the total weight of these four blévita graines de courges crackers to be approximately 40 grams."

The target food item is 'crème de marrons,' which is visibly spread on a small piece of bread. Starting with visual identification, the crème de marrons is spread evenly but relatively thinly on a bread slice approximately 10 cm long. The spread covers almost the entire surface but is not piled up, suggesting a moderate volume. For dimension analysis, the surface area covered is roughly 30-35 cm² with a thickness around 0.3 to 0.4 cm. Chestnut cream has a dense, pasty consistency similar to a thick jam, meaning it has a density close to a thick puree, around 1.1 g/cm³. Multiplying surface area by thickness yields a volume of about 10-14 cm³. Using the density, this corresponds to an estimated weight range of approximately 11-15 grams. Given the portion size is modest and typical for a small piece of bread, I select the middle of that range. So, the estimated weight of the crème de marrons is about 13 grams."

The pasta portion covers the central area of the plate but is not piled very high, indicating a moderate depth of around 2-3 cm. Considering both penne and fusilli take space differently but are cooked and compact, the total volume appears to be roughly 150-180 ml in volume. Cooked pasta is dense and heavy relative to volume, with an approximate density of about 0.9 grams per ml. Multiplying volume by density, this gives an estimated weight range of about 135-160 grams.

The target food item is 'graines de chia' (chia seeds), which are visible sprinkled throughout the white mixture in the bowl. The bowl contains a mix of blanc battu, flocons d'avoine, graines de chia, and miel, so the chia seeds are distributed in a moderately thin layer mixed in the dish. Visually, the chia seeds are small black dots spread throughout the volume; they occupy a small fraction of the total volume. Considering the bowl size (standard small bowl ~12-15 cm diameter) and the visible amount of seeds, the chia seeds likely weigh less compared to the dairy and oat components. Chia seeds are dense and heavy for their small size. The visible chia seeds presence corresponds roughly to a tablespoon or slightly less, typically around 12 grams per tablespoon. Since the quantity appears less than a full tablespoon yet significant in distribution, a conservative estimate for the chia seeds amount is between 7 and 10 grams. Taking a medium portion in this range, I estimate the weight of the 'graines de chia' in the bowl to be approximately 8 grams."

The target food item is 'moutarde' (mustard). In the image, the mustard itself is not directly visible outside the pita bread, but logically it would be a thin spread inside the sandwich. Mustard is a condiment applied sparingly, usually in a thin layer with a very low volume and weight relative to the other ingredients. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes and usual spreading thickness, the mustard content is likely around 5 to 10 grams. Given the visual evidence of a single pita sandwich and typical mustard application, I estimate the mustard weight to be approximately 7 grams."
