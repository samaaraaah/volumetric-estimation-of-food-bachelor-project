xjvrtk,tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe,250.0,60.0,190.0,5.062886378170965,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/f607625b-a07d-423e-a564-4d96ebadf084,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single slice of tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe on a small dessert plate. Step 1: Identification – the slice is fully visible and clearly shows rhubarb pieces distributed evenly over a cream-based topping on a thin crispy crust, which is typical for tarte flambée. There are many small rhubarb chunks covering the surface of the slice. Step 2: Dimension analysis – the plate appears to be a small dessert plate, roughly 18-20 cm in diameter, and the slice occupies about half of it. The slice is triangular, about 10-12 cm on the longest side and about 1 cm thick including the crust and topping. Step 3: Density considerations – rhubarb is a vegetable with moderate density but high moisture, and the slice overall includes a thin dough base, a layer of cream, and chopped rhubarb. This means the rhubarb component is a minority weight-wise compared to the total slice. Step 4: Portion size calibration – a whole tarte flambée of this style usually weighs about 200-250 g; a quarter slice, as shown, is about 50-70 g total. Since we are estimating only the 'tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe' itself (including all visible components), the bulk of the weight is from the slice shown. Given the thin crust and relatively modest topping thickness, the weight of this slice is estimated closer to 60 g. Step 5: Cross-validation – the visible volume, the plate size, and the food density all support a conservative estimate in the 55-65 g range, with 60 g being a balanced figure. Therefore, the estimated weight of this tarte flambée slice is 60 grams."
p96w4a,délice tomate mozzarella,54.0,210.0,156.0,0.897889575783415,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/5ebafbd6-315d-44a6-8508-ba143d23adb2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with a ""délice tomate mozzarella"" on the left side, consisting of alternating slices of fresh tomato and mozzarella cheese, drizzled with balsamic vinegar and sprinkled with herbs. There are approximately 6 visible tomato slices and 6 slices of mozzarella, layered in an overlapping fashion. Each tomato slice appears to be about 1 cm thick and roughly 5-6 cm in diameter, typical of a medium-sized tomato. A medium tomato slice can weigh around 15 grams. Multiplying 6 slices by 15 grams gives about 90 grams of tomato. The mozzarella slices look about the same thickness and size as the tomato slices. Fresh mozzarella is relatively dense, so a slice of similar size may weigh about 20 grams. Multiplying 6 slices by 20 grams gives around 120 grams of mozzarella. Adding these, the total weight of the ""délice tomate mozzarella"" (tomato plus mozzarella combined) is approximately 210 grams. Since the requested target item is the ""délice tomate mozzarella"" as a whole dish, this total estimation is appropriate. The balsamic vinegar and herbs add negligible weight, and no container weight is included. Therefore, the estimated weight of the ""délice tomate mozzarella"" is about 210 grams."
xjvrtk,courgette et oignons,300.0,170.0,130.0,4.156896184182477,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a glass container with two distinct portions: one side contains cooked courgette (zucchini) and onions, and the other side has millet black bean corn patties. Focusing only on the 'courgette et oignons', I see chopped pieces of zucchini and onions sautéed together, filling approximately half of the container. The pieces are spread out relatively flat but with some thickness indicating a depth around 2-3 cm. Comparing the portion size to the container width (about 15 cm) and length (about 15 cm), the courgette and onion portion occupies roughly 7x12 cm in area. Considering the dense and moist nature of cooked vegetables like courgette and onions, they tend to retain weight. The volume estimated is approximately 7x12x2.5 = 210 cubic cm. Cooked courgette and onion have a density near 0.9 g/cm3, so the weight estimate is around 190 grams. Swiss portions are generally smaller, so adjusting slightly downward given the visual size, I estimate around 170 grams for the courgette and onions portion."
2ahgvr,porridge salé,48.0,170.0,122.0,0.6241739501172457,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a35f3211-3b33-4826-97b8-3af69655dada,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small glass jar with a golden lid, filled nearly to the top with porridge salé (savory porridge). The jar appears similar in size to common Swiss small jars, roughly 200 ml in volume. The porridge is compact and dense, consisting of soaked oats with added liquid and presumably some savory ingredients, giving it a dense consistency. The visible height of the porridge filling is about 70-80% of the jar's volume. Assuming the jar capacity is close to 200 ml, 80% fills around 160 ml porridge. The density of cooked porridge usually ranges around 1 to 1.1 g/ml; thus, the total weight should be about 160-176 grams. Considering a Swiss portion and that the jar might be designed for a single serving, I estimate the weight of the porridge salé at approximately 170 grams."
ppf8hc,pâtes carbonara,236.0,130.0,106.0,2.666382434448945,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/4d4e6539-b86f-4019-b2aa-0c15dbce0667,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate of pâtes carbonara with visible penne pasta, small bits of bacon or pancetta, and a creamy sauce. The pasta portion appears moderate, typical of a Swiss lunch portion, occupying a central area on a standard-sized plate (approx. 25 cm diameter). The pasta depth is fairly flat, about 2-3 cm thick on average, and the density is relatively high because cooked pasta is dense and combined with sauce and meat. I estimate the pasta portion weight (including sauce and meat) to be roughly between 120-150 grams, leaning to medium portion size. The small bits of bacon add some density but not much volume. The visible grated gruyère cheese topping is lightly sprinkled, appearing to be about 10 grams, but since the target is only pâtes carbonara (the whole dish), cheese is excluded. Therefore, the estimation is for the pasta dish excluding grated cheese balance. Thus, my estimated weight for the pâtes carbonara alone, without the cheese topping, is about 130 grams."
p8a2w5,yogourt industriel à l'abricot avec morceaux,171.0,75.0,96.0,1.7497335322958858,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/e4f800da-c429-4a04-823c-ac3792f64c00,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a white bowl containing apricot-flavored industrial yogurt with visible fruit pieces mixed in. The yogurt fills roughly about a third of the bowl's volume. Considering that a typical small bowl of this size holds roughly 200-250 grams when full, and here the yogurt occupies about a third of that space, the volume is approximately 70-80 grams. Yogurt has a density close to water so 1 ml roughly equals 1 gram. The pieces of apricot add minimal extra volume and weight. Given the context of Swiss portion sizes being slightly smaller, I estimate the weight of the yogurt (including apricot pieces) to be about 75 grams."

The image shows a bowl divided into two portions: white rice on one side and dahl de lentilles corail on the other. We are asked to estimate the weight of the 'riz' (rice) only. The rice portion occupies approximately half of a medium-sized bowl, appearing dense and moist but not overly compacted. Using the spoon as a size reference, the depth and volume of the rice can be estimated as moderate, typical for a Swiss portion which is generally smaller than US portions. Cooked white rice generally has a density close to 130-150 grams per cup (about 240 ml). Visually, the rice is about half the bowl which likely holds around 300-350 ml in total; thus, the rice portion might be roughly 150-175 ml in volume. Multiplying 150 ml by an approximate density of 140 g per 240 ml translates to around 90-100 grams of cooked rice. Considering these visual and density factors, a conservative estimate of the rice weight is about 95 grams."
wrah5h,gaufre à la patate douce,85.0,170.0,85.0,0.7700916648902153,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1876b0b6-568d-4583-8186-073df252e6c9,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is the 'gaufre à la patate douce' (sweet potato waffle). The image shows four rectangular waffle pieces on a standard-sized plate, each topped with sauce and smoked salmon. The waffles appear homemade and somewhat thick with good volume, about 7x7 cm each. Considering the Swiss portion context, these waffles are smaller than US standard. Sweet potato waffles tend to be dense but not excessively heavy. Assuming a thickness of about 1.5 cm and a density similar to cooked sweet potato-based waffle, I estimate each piece to weigh roughly 40-45 grams. There are 4 pieces, so total weight is approximately 160-180 grams. Since we're asked to estimate the entire sweet potato waffle portion (all 4 pieces together, as they form one serving), I select the midpoint estimate of 170 grams, considering the presence of sauce and salmon which are excluded as per rules."
wrah5h,"délice des dieux (biscuit, fruits rouges, séré+mascarpone)",205.0,120.0,85.0,1.8572798976764016,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/5de398c7-684b-448d-ba0a-f318d009bccd,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image depicts a slice of 'délice des dieux' dessert composed of biscuit base, red fruits (raspberries and blueberries), and a creamy topping of séré mixed with mascarpone. The piece is on a small dessert plate, which provides scale: the slice is approximately 9 cm by 7 cm in surface area. The biscuit base appears moist and dense but thin, roughly 1 cm thick. The creamy layer on top is about 1.5 cm thick and quite dense due to mascarpone and séré, while the visible fruits (2 raspberries and 2 blueberries on top) add small but notable weight. Accounting for the fruits embedded in the biscuit base as well (visible at edges) increases total volume slightly. Given standard Swiss portion sizes are moderate, and considering the density of ingredients (dense cream, moist biscuit, fresh berries), the estimated total weight range would be between 100 to 140 grams. I place the estimation at the medium level, around 120 grams, which accounts adequately for the volume and ingredients visible without overestimating density or weight."
xjvrtk,ananas,200.0,280.0,80.0,1.7053933063312727,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/b41068f9-5a0e-4c11-bf1b-7389d3917889,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a blue ceramic bowl containing pieces of pineapple (ananas) cut into roughly triangular chunks. There are 13 visible pieces, varying slightly in size but generally averaging about 3-4 cm in length and about 1.5-2 cm in thickness. Considering the typical density of fresh pineapple, which is juicy but firm fruit, each piece likely weighs between 20 and 25 grams. Multiplying by the number of pieces and accounting for small size variation, the total weight comes to approximately 280 grams. The portion appears consistent with a medium serving of pineapple in a Swiss context (smaller than US portions). Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the pineapple to be about 280 grams."
wrah5h,porc,52.0,130.0,78.0,0.4323172031549776,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/f727ac79-973e-4b92-8f2b-cda94222d4a7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'porc' (pork), which is located at the bottom left of the container, partially covered by a white sauce. Visually, the piece of pork appears to be a single cooked cutlet piece. Comparing the size to the grilled aubergine slices on top which are typically 5-7 cm wide, and considering the container's small lunchbox size, the pork piece is approximately 9 cm long, 6 cm wide, and about 1.5 cm thick. Pork is a dense meat, so weight estimation should reflect that. A similar sized pork piece usually weighs around 100-150 grams in Swiss portion sizes. Given the thickness and size, and accounting for some volume lost during cooking, I estimate the pork portion to be medium-sized, about 130 grams."
ppf8hc,poivrons jaune,150.0,80.0,70.0,1.1191643572798977,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/95e84def-c82b-4360-8390-f5153ff61064,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'poivrons jaune' (yellow bell peppers). In the image, there is one yellow bell pepper that has been cut; the main hollowed half is filled with quinoa and bulgur, and two smaller curved pieces are placed on the plate. The peppers appear cooked and softened, which slightly reduces their density compared to raw peppers but not drastically. Visually, the pepper is medium-sized for a Swiss portion, approximately 8-10 cm in length and about 5 cm in width for the curved pieces, with some thickness indicating a hollowed but substantial piece. Considering the smaller Swiss portion context and reducing the weight of seeds and core (not visible here as it's replaced by grains), the total weight of the yellow bell pepper pieces looks like it would be around 70-90 grams. The two smaller pieces plus the main stuffed portion together represent almost a full pepper less the seeds. Therefore, estimating conservatively to 80 grams is reasonable."
wrah5h,haricots rouges,91.0,22.0,69.0,0.6692602856533788,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1550c506-8c95-461f-b658-8f427dc2a0af,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'haricots rouges' (red kidney beans) located on the left side of the blue plate. The beans are visible as individual whole pieces with a shiny, moist surface and appear to be cooked. Counting roughly, there are about 30-40 visible beans. Each cooked kidney bean typically weighs around 0.5 to 0.7 grams. The beans are piled but mostly fully visible; there is little hidden volume underneath given the spread on the plate. Comparing their size to the pasta spirals and the plate, the portion is moderate but not large. Considering the density of cooked beans, the weight estimate per bean and portion size, I calculate a minimum range of about 15 grams (30 beans x 0.5g) and a maximum of around 28 grams (40 beans x 0.7g). Given this moderate serving size, the estimation leans toward the middle of that range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the haricots rouges to be approximately 22 grams."
p8a2w5,tarte aux fraises,164.0,95.0,69.0,1.2061394159027925,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/7b64b358-b611-4155-8e79-6f3ce5b4f11a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a slice of tarte aux fraises on a standard dessert plate, which provides a good size reference. The slice has about eight visible strawberry halves arranged on top and a few red currants embedded in the cream. Each strawberry half looks medium-sized, relatively dense, and typical for fresh fruit portions. The tart slice is filled with a creamy layer and has a thin pastry crust visible along the edges and crumbs on the plate. Considering that the strawberries contribute significant volume and weight due to their density along with the cream and pastry base, and accounting for the Swiss smaller portion size, I estimate an average strawberry half weighs about 12 grams, which totals around 96 grams for strawberries alone. The creamy filling and crust add additional weight but are not included here as we only estimate the strawberries. Therefore, the estimated weight of only the strawberries on this slice of tarte aux fraises is approximately 95 grams."

The image shows a plate filled with sliced tomatoes arranged in a somewhat single layer with some overlapping slices. The tomatoes appear fresh, medium-sized, and cut into wedges and rounds. By counting, there are roughly 12-14 visible tomato pieces. Each slice is about 1-1.5 cm thick, and the slices have a typical tomato density which is moderately dense but water-rich, around 0.9 g/cm³. The plate is a standard medium-sized plate (around 22-24 cm diameter), and the slices cover the plate center with some thickness approximating a single layer but with slight overlaps indicating slight piling. Given this, an average slice likely weighs about 25-30 grams given its size and density. Multiplying the average by the estimated 13 slices gives around 325-390 grams. Taking into account some volume loss due to gaps and overlaps, I estimate the total weight of the tomato salad to be about 350 grams."

The image shows a plate with mashed potatoes (purée de pdt) topped with beef stew (viande ragoût), carrots, and sauce. Focusing on the purée de pdt, it occupies a medium section of the plate underneath the meat and sauce. The mashed potatoes appear smooth and creamy with some height visible, roughly 2-3 cm thick covering an area about the size of a large adult palm (around 10 cm by 8 cm). Considering Swiss portion sizes, which are generally moderate, and typical density of smooth mashed potatoes (approximately 0.7 g/cm³), I estimate the visible purée depth and area to yield a weight in the range of 130-170 grams. Given the portion looks moderately thick and occupies a fair portion of the plate but not heaped, I select the middle of this range for the estimate. Therefore, the purée de pdt weighs approximately 150 grams."
wrah5h,polenta,209.0,145.0,64.0,1.425708804092944,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/f727ac79-973e-4b92-8f2b-cda94222d4a7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The polenta is located on the right side of the container, topped with shredded cheese. Visually, the polenta portion is roughly a compact mound about 7 cm long, 5 cm wide, and about 3-4 cm thick, considering it is slightly covered with cheese and looks dense. Polenta is a cooked cornmeal dish, dense but lighter than meat. Given the size relative to the metal container, which appears to be a small lunch box, this polenta portion corresponds to a small to medium portion typical in Swiss meals. Estimating volume and known densities, the polenta here likely weighs between 130 to 160 grams. I select a middle value of about 145 grams, considering the modest size and density, plus the volume hidden by cheese topping."
wrah5h,tiramisu,72.0,135.0,63.0,0.4834790023449158,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/7b0475df-5b02-4072-abb9-ef75acf0f031,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a black plate with two distinct dessert pieces, with the tiramisu identified as the lighter, beige creamy layered piece with cocoa powder on top on the left side. The tiramisu portion appears to be a typical individual serving size, about 10 cm long, 4 cm wide, and roughly 3.5 cm thick. The light cream and soaked sponge layers suggest a typical density for tiramisu, which is moderately dense due to the soaked cake and mascarpone cream layers. Considering Swiss portion sizes, which are smaller than US portions, this slice looks like a medium portion. Standard medium tiramisu portions weigh around 120-150 grams. Given the visible volume, layering, and texture density, an estimate near the middle of this range is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the tiramisu piece to be approximately 135 grams."
8japfq,ratatouille,196.0,135.0,61.0,1.2743551481560436,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/b6659a8f-25e7-44f7-a351-7873f60f1586,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is ratatouille, which is located on the upper right of the plate. It is a cooked vegetable mixture with visible pieces of eggplant, zucchini, and tomato chunks. The portion size is moderate but not very large, occupying about one-sixth of the plate. Considering the plate size is a standard small to medium Swiss plate (approximately 24cm in diameter), the ratatouille has a depth that is slightly hidden but apparent from the compactness of the vegetable chunks. Cooked vegetables retain density, so we cannot underestimate the weight despite the pieces appearing soft and cooked down. The ratatouille portion looks to be about 120-150 grams in weight. Balancing the visible volume, density, and a moderate portion size usual in Swiss servings, I estimate the ratatouille weight to be approximately 135 grams."

The target food item is 'brochette de boeuf,' which is visible on the plate as three sizeable beef chunks skewered on a wooden stick. Comparing the size of the beef pieces to the bread slice and the sausage (mergez) nearby, each beef chunk appears roughly 3-4 cm in width and about 4-5 cm in length, with decent thickness around 3-4 cm. Beef is dense, so these three pieces together likely represent a moderate portion size. A single beef cube of this size could weigh approximately 40-50 grams. Multiplying by three pieces gives roughly 120-150 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes tend to be on the smaller side, and allowing for some space and any fat or shrinkage during cooking, I estimate the total weight of the brochette de boeuf to be about 135 grams."
ppf8hc,boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate,316.0,260.0,56.0,1.8861649968023875,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/bf22a1b3-a8b6-4823-a44b-0893c3097763,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate.' In the image, there are 9 visible vegetable meatballs, covered partly in tomato sauce. Each boulettes looks to be approximately 3-4 cm in diameter, typical for small vegetable meatballs. They have a dense appearance with visible herbs and are coated in sauce, which adds slight weight but not significant volume. Comparing the boulettes to the penne pasta beneath and the size of the plate suggests each boulettes weighs about 30 grams, considering their density similar to cooked vegetable/meat mixtures. Multiplying 9 boulettes by 30 grams gives a total range about 270 grams. Given some variability in size and coating of sauce, estimating a slightly conservative weight of 260 grams is reasonable to account for any smaller boulettes or sauce variability."
wrah5h,yogourt chocolat,176.0,120.0,56.0,1.050522276700064,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/a52672d9-9e62-4a28-8952-792840f894b6,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a clear glass bowl containing a visibly creamy, chocolate-flavored yogurt. The target food is 'yogourt chocolat.' The quantity appears to be a single spoonful or a small serving scooped into the bowl, with visible swirls and a moderate volume. Considering the bowl's size relative to the visible tabletop texture, the amount of yogurt likely fills about half of a small dessert bowl. Typical Swiss yogurt portions are smaller than US ones, and single snack portions of yogurt generally range between 100 to 150 grams. Given the moderate volume and density of yogurt, and the absence of additional ingredients or thick layering, I estimate this serving of chocolate yogurt to be approximately 120 grams."
p96w4a,cervelas,130.0,185.0,55.0,0.7620976337667875,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/58f82c5a-4b79-4f95-9f8f-0b55a93d8383,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate divided into three main parts: cooked spiral pasta on the left, a red chili mixture with visible chunks of cervelas sausage on the right, and a dollop of crème fraîche between them. The cervelas pieces are roughly cubed and fairly abundant within the chili sauce. I counted approximately 10 to 12 distinct chunks of cervelas visible on the plate, though some pieces might be partially submerged or overlapped by the sauce, indicating a slightly larger total volume. Each piece appears about the size of a large dice, roughly 2-3 cm per side, making for a moderate thickness and density. Considering the dense, meaty nature of cervelas sausage, which is quite compact and heavy for its volume, each piece likely weighs around 15-20 grams. Multiplying 11 pieces by an average of 17 grams gives an approximate total weight of about 185 grams. This number fits a medium portion typically served in Swiss contexts. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the cervelas on this plate to be approximately 185 grams."

The target food item is 'tomate' (tomato). In the image, the tomatoes are located on the left side of the container, visible as several medium-sized slices or wedges of fresh tomato with a bright red color. I count around three to four pieces of tomato. The tomato pieces appear to be about 5-6 cm in length each, with moderate thickness. Tomatoes have a relatively high water content, making them lighter than dense vegetables of the same volume but still fairly substantial weight. Given the size and number of pieces, and considering the metal container is a smaller Swiss portion container, the total visible tomato portion likely weighs in the range of 90-120 grams. I estimate a medium portion weight closer to 100 grams, accounting for density and some hidden depth beneath the visible surface pieces."
p8a2w5,dahl de lentille,281.0,230.0,51.0,1.5274994670645918,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/5ddea52e-8411-4822-893f-d8420fa6cb40,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'dahl de lentille,' which appears as the orange legume portion mixed with vegetables in the bowl. Visually, the bowl is medium-sized and on a flat surface, with a fork beside it for scale. The dahl portion occupies roughly half or slightly more of the bowl's volume, with visible chunks of lentils and vegetables such as carrots and onions. Lentils cooked in a dahl are dense and moist; considering the mixed appearance with some rice underneath, the total volume of dahl is estimated at about 1 to 1.5 standard Swiss portion sizes. Assuming the bowl depth to be about 5-6 cm and width about 12-14 cm, with the dahl portion filling around half of that, the volume corresponds roughly to 200-250 grams for the dahl. Given dahl's density, I estimate the dahl de lentille portion to be at the medium range around 230 grams."

The image shows a bowl with white séré maigre (a type of low-fat cottage cheese or quark) and sliced kiwi on top. The kiwi slices are the target food item. First, I count the individual pieces of kiwi visible: approximately 20 distinct slices of varying sizes. Each kiwi slice appears about 2-3 cm long and roughly 1-1.5 cm thick. Considering the density of kiwi fruit, which is quite watery but still firm, a typical medium-sized kiwi weighs around 70 grams. Given the slices appear to cover the surface of the bowl and appear roughly equivalent to one sliced medium kiwi, I estimate the total kiwi weight to be close to a full medium-sized kiwi. There is no visible skin, so only the edible portion is counted. Therefore, the weight should be approximately 70 grams."

The target food item is 'sauce,' which is visible as the brown liquid spread around and over the mashed potatoes, meat ragout, and carrots on the plate. The sauce appears to cover a good portion of the plate, surrounding the other items and partially pooling underneath. The plate is of standard size, approximately 24 cm in diameter, providing a reference for volume estimation. Given the visible spread and considering a typical sauce density (slightly thinner than water, around 1 g/ml), the sauce seems to occupy roughly 100 to 120 ml in volume when accounting for the spread and some absorption into the food. Since sauce is liquid, weight in grams roughly equals volume in ml. Considering Swiss portion sizes are smaller than US ones, I would estimate the sauce portion here to be about 110 grams, as it is a moderate serving and not overly heavy on the plate."

The image shows a plate with three different food items: mozzarella, olives, and a green salad. The target is the mozzarella. The mozzarella portion appears as one whole piece, smooth and rounded, occupying about one-sixth of the plate. The diameter looks roughly around 7-8 cm, about the size of a typical fresh mozzarella ball found in Swiss portion sizes. The thickness is around 2-3 cm, giving the mozzarella a shape of a flattened sphere. Considering the density of fresh mozzarella, which is quite dense but also moist, a piece of this size typically weighs between 100 and 130 grams. Since this portion looks like a moderate size and fully intact, I estimate the mozzarella weight at around 120 grams."

The image shows a bowl divided into two halves: one with white rice and the other with dalh de lentilles corail, a lentil stew containing visible carrots and onions. Focusing only on the dalh, it appears to fill roughly half of a medium-sized bowl, which judging from the spoon size and bowl diameter, is about 12 cm across. The dalh is dense and thick, with a volume depth likely about 4-5 cm given the bowl's apparent curvature and typical portion depth. Estimating the volume as half the bowl's total volume, around 300-350 ml of stew, and considering the density of cooked lentil stew being close to 1 g/ml due to its thick consistency and vegetables, the weight is approximately 300-350 grams. Considering this is a typical Swiss home portion, I select the mid-range estimate for this portion size, around 320 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread on a standard-sized plate. Each slice appears to be a typical portion of sliced bread, approximately 1.5 cm thick and roughly 10 cm by 7 cm in dimension. The bread has a standard density for sliced white or wheat bread, a common Swiss-sized slice which tends to weigh less than typical American servings due to smaller portion sizes. Each slice of bread typically weights around 30-40 grams in Swiss context. Here, we see two slices of bread, one topped with butter and jam, the other with butter and Nutella, but as per instructions, we only estimate the bread's weight. Accounting for the density and thickness visible, I estimate each slice to be about 35 grams, totaling around 70 grams for both slices. Since the instruction is to estimate weight of 'pain' (bread) and the image shows two full slices, the total weight of the bread is approximately 70 grams."

The salade de céleri is the shredded white vegetable salad in the bottom right quadrant of the plate. It appears to be a moderate mound of grated celery root with some dressing. Comparing its size to the sliced potatoes beside it and the roasted chicken portion, the pile is roughly the volume of a small to medium side salad heap. The celery root is a dense vegetable, so the volume translates to a meaningful weight. Considering Swiss portion sizes are generally smaller, and accounting for the creamy dressing that may add slight weight but is mostly coating, I estimate the weight to be in a medium portion range of about 80 to 110 grams. Given the visual cues and moderation of the portion, I estimate the salad de céleri weighs approximately 95 grams."

The image shows a small green bowl with four large strawberries ('fraises'). Each strawberry is visibly quite large compared to the bowl itself, with intact green leafy tops. The largest strawberries appear to be around 7-8 cm in length and are quite plump, suggesting a dense, juicy fruit. A typical large strawberry of this size in Swiss portions usually weighs between 25 and 35 grams. The strawberries here are fairly uniform, with one smaller piece that likely weighs about 15 grams. Summing these up—two large strawberries at about 30 grams each, one medium at 25 grams, and one small at 15 grams—gives a total estimated weight of approximately 100 grams. This estimate accounts for the density and whole visible volume without the container."

The image shows a white bowl containing cereals mixed with milk. The cereals appear to be a combination of flakes and small chunks, some of which look like chocolate pieces. The cereals cover the bottom part of the bowl with a relatively thin visible layer, and the milk partially submerges them, indicating the cereals' depth is not very large. Comparing the cereal pieces with the spoon, the flakes are small and thin, typically low density compared to solid chunks of chocolate. The portion is clearly moderate, occupying the equivalent of about a small to medium bowl portion, typical for Swiss servings which tend to be smaller than American portions. Considering that dry cereals weigh approximately 30-40 grams for a bowl portion and that some cereal has absorbed some milk but we exclude the milk weight, I estimate the weight of cereals visually here to be about 35 grams."
8japfq,muesli nature,53.0,95.0,42.0,0.2372628437433383,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/aec8837c-53fa-470e-b484-737ecb280e65,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a bowl with muesli nature partially covering a portion of yaourt nature. The target food item is muesli nature. For visual identification, the muesli consists of oats, grains, and some small nuts or seeds, visible as a dry granular layer covering a thick portion of yogurt. The muesli occupies a surface area of roughly half the bowl’s visible top, and given the depth of the bowl is moderate, the muesli layer appears to be about 1.5 to 2 cm thick. For dimension analysis, the bowl is standard-sized, likely around 12-14 cm in diameter. Taking a 13 cm diameter and assuming a 2 cm depth layer of muesli, volume of muesli is approx π × (6.5 cm)^2 × 2 cm ≈ 265 cubic cm. Muesli is a somewhat dense but airy food, with density typically around 0.4 to 0.5 g/cm³. Using 0.45 g/cm³ for this natural muesli, weight estimate is 265 × 0.45 = approximately 119 grams. Considering this is a Swiss portion, which tends to be smaller, and that the muesli does not completely fill the bowl with a spread layer mixed with yogurt, I will reduce this estimate slightly. A medium portion of muesli in this bowl is likely around 90 to 110 grams, but more conservative towards 95 grams is reasonable. Therefore, I conclude the weight of the muesli nature in this bowl to be about 95 grams."

The image shows three vegetarian gyozas on a white plate. Each gyoza appears to be about 6-7 cm in length, typical for small to medium-sized traditional gyozas. Gyozas have a thin dough wrapper and are filled with vegetables, which results in a moderate density. Considering the size, shape, and thickness visible, each gyoza likely weighs between 30 and 40 grams. Since there are 3 pieces, the total weight of the gyozas is approximately 90 to 120 grams. Selecting a medium portion value within this range, I estimate the combined weight of the 3 vegetarian gyozas to be about 105 grams."

The image shows a small blue translucent bowl held in a hand, containing a portion of crème caramel. The crème caramel appears creamy and smooth, with a custard-like consistency. The portion fills only the bottom center of the bowl, suggesting a relatively small amount. Considering the size of the hand and fingers holding the bowl as a reference, the diameter of the base holding the crème caramel is roughly 7-8 cm, with a shallow depth about 1.5-2 cm. Crème caramel has a density close to that of heavy custard, around 1 g/cm3. Estimating the volume as a shallow oval of approximately 7 cm diameter and 2 cm thickness, the volume is roughly 70-80 cm3, corresponding to about 70-80 grams. Considering the modest amount and some air/irregular surface, a weight estimate near the lower middle of that range is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the crème caramel portion to be approximately 75 grams."

The chili is the reddish bean and meat mixture covering about half of the plate. Visually, it is a thick stew containing kidney beans and chunks of cervelas sausage, mixed in a tomato-based sauce. The beans and meat chunks give it a dense consistency. The plate appears to be a standard small Swiss plate of about 20-22 cm diameter. The chili covers approximately half the plate surface with some volume visible in thickness, estimated around 2-3 cm. Given this coverage and thickness, and knowing chili is dense due to beans and meat, a typical portion on such a plate ranges between 200-250 grams. Considering the visible size and density, this serving looks medium-sized. Therefore, I estimate the chili weighs approximately 230 grams."

The image shows a single cooked or steamed artichaut (artichoke) on a medium-sized plate, which provides a scale reference. The artichoke is compact, with some visible petals open and a typical bulbous body. Usually, a small to medium artichoke weighs between 150 to 300 grams untrimmed; here the one shown appears to be on the smaller side compared to the plate and the hand holding it. Considering the density of artichokes, which are fairly dense with a lot of water content, and the photo showing a moderately sized specimen, I estimate the weight in the lower to mid-range of typical artichoke weights. The artichoke likely weighs about 180 grams."

The image shows a single slice of homemade chocolate fondant cake placed on a square plate. The slice is about the length of a standard dessert plate wedge, likely around 12-14 cm long, with a width at the widest part about 5-6 cm, and a height of approximately 3-4 cm. The fondant au chocolat is dense and moist, typical of this type of dessert, so it has a relatively high density. Based on visual comparison with the plate edge thickness and typical fondant portions in Swiss contexts (which tend to be moderate in size), the thickness and density suggest a slice weight range roughly between 90 and 130 grams. Given the portion size appears medium and considering the typical moisture and richness of a chocolate fondant, I estimate the weight of this slice at about 110 grams."

The image shows a single rectangular waffle ('gaufre') on a decorated plate. The waffle is clearly visible in full, with no parts hidden or cut. Waffles in Swiss portions are generally smaller and lighter than US sizes. This waffle is about the size of a hand palm or slightly smaller, roughly 10 cm x 7 cm, and about 1.5 cm thick. Waffles have moderate density with some air pockets inside due to their batter and cooking process, so they are not very heavy for their volume but still substantial. Typical Swiss portion waffles of this size tend to weigh around 70 to 90 grams. Since this waffle appears to be a standard homemade or store-bought size without extra thick batter or toppings (excluding compote), I estimate a medium portion weight at approximately 80 grams."

The target food item is 'cottage cheese aux herbes,' which is located near the bottom center of the plate, appearing as a small mound of white curds mixed with herb bits. Step 1: Visual Identification – The portion is distinct and isolated from other food items, visibly about the size of 1-2 tablespoons. Step 2: Dimension Analysis – Compared to the fork and other items (such as olives and the fried egg), the cottage cheese portion is compact, roughly 4-5 cm wide and about 1.5 cm thick. Step 3: Density Considerations – Cottage cheese is a soft, moist cheese with a density close to 100-110 g per 100 ml. This small volume equates to a modest weight. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration – The portion size is medium for a plated dairy cheese serving in Swiss context, suggesting a weight around 60-80 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation – The portion is consistent with typical cottage cheese spoonfuls served as a side, supporting a medium portion estimate around 70 grams. Therefore, the weight of 'cottage cheese aux herbes' on this plate is estimated at 70 grams."

The slice is roughly standard size, about 12 cm long and 6 cm wide. The spread covers the slice fairly evenly but not thickly—about 3-5 mm depth. Eggplant caviar is a cooked vegetable spread with moderate density, somewhat moist but not heavy. Considering the area coverage and thickness, the volume is roughly 40-50 ml. Given the density similar to cooked cooked vegetable dips (~0.9 g/ml), this spread should weigh around 36-45 grams. Accounting for a typical moderate portion size in a Swiss context (not too generous), I estimate the weight of the caviar d'aubergine to be approximately 40 grams."

The plate is a standard dinner plate of approximately 25-27 cm diameter, serving as a reference. The pasta strands appear to be tagliatelle style, cooked, and are somewhat flat and dense. Considering the visible surface and a reasonable thickness or depth of pasta in the pile (around 1.5-2 cm thick), the volume looks moderate but not large. Cooked pasta is dense and heavy for its volume. Comparing to common Swiss portion sizes for pasta served in moderate meals, this looks like a small to medium portion, likely between 90 and 130 grams. Given the visible amount and the creamy sauce, I estimate the pasta weight to be approximately 110 grams to be conservative and realistic for Swiss portion context."

Each slice looks about 8 cm by 8 cm and has a thickness of roughly 1.5-2 cm. Typical weight for such a toasted slice is around 25-30 grams. Since the target is only the toast, I will exclude the fromage frais spread on top. Given the visual size and standard bread portion sizes in Switzerland, the toast slice weighs approximately 28 grams."

I can see the 'perle de blé' spread under and around the shrimp and sauce, occupying roughly one third of the bowl's volume. The bowl is a medium size, and the wheat pearls are cooked and mixed with a sauce, making them denser and heavier than raw grains. Considering the density of cooked wheat pearls, which is around 1.3 g/cm3, and that they form a somewhat compact layer with some visible depth, I estimate the volume to be about 120-150 ml. This corresponds to approximately 150-195 grams. Adjusting for some visible gaps and mixing with sauce, a reasonable estimate is about 165 grams for the 'perle de blé'."

The image shows a single container of 'yogourt figue sans sucre' (fig yogurt without added sugar). This is a typical single-serve yogurt cup from Migros Bio, which usually contains between 120g and 150g of product. Visually, the cup looks to be about a standard 125g yogurt portion size—small and similar in size to regular Swiss yogurt containers. Since the yogurt is partly eaten but the container still appears mostly full, I estimate the original portion weight to be 125 grams. The container has no visible excess empty space or added bulk outside the yogurt itself. Considering Swiss portion sizes tend to be smaller than US ones, this weight aligns well with common standards. Therefore, the weight of the 'yogourt figue sans sucre' in this image is estimated at 125 grams."

Both pieces are relatively small and shaped in irregular chunks, typical of goat/sheep cheeses. Comparing them visually to the adjacent slice of baguette and other cheeses, each piece is about the size of a small thumb segment, solid but soft-density cheeses. Considering Swiss portion norms, each piece likely weighs between 15 to 25 grams. Together, this suggests a combined weight in the range of 30 to 50 grams. Given the size and density, I estimate the total weight for the two bouts of fromage de brebis/chèvre to be about 40 grams."

The image shows four slices of different cheeses on a plate, next to a slice of seeded bread (which we do not count). The cheeses are identified as manchego, two types of gruyère, and raclette. Visually, each cheese slice is roughly similar in area, approximately 3-4 cm long and about 1-2 cm wide, with a thickness of approximately 0.4-0.5 cm. Considering the density of hard cheeses like manchego and gruyère, which is dense and compact, and raclette which is semi-soft but similar in density, the average weight per slice can be estimated at about 15 grams, as each slice has a small volume but is dense. Multiplying by four slices, total cheese weight is about 60 grams. The slices don't have any visible added bulk or irregular thickness, so this weight seems reasonable for a Swiss portion. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of all the cheeses combined to be approximately 60 grams."

The target food item is 'pain,' which is a slice of bread with Nutella spread on it. Step 1: The slice of bread is clearly visible on a standard-sized dessert plate. Comparing it to the size of the plate and the nearby strawberries, it is a single medium-thickness slice of whole grain or brown bread. Step 2: Visually, the bread slice is roughly 10-12 cm in length, about 8-9 cm wide, and around 1.5 cm thick. Bread density is moderate, so the volume corresponds to a weight typically between 25-35 grams for such a slice in Swiss portion context. Step 3: The Nutella spread is excluded as per instructions. Step 4: Given the slice is of medium size and slightly thick but not a large slice, a medium portion weight estimate is appropriate. Step 5: Taking standard Swiss slice weights into account and visual volume, I estimate the bread slice weighs approximately 30 grams."

The target food is 'betterave' (beetroot), which is located on the left side of the plate in dark red, cubed pieces. I count approximately 12 visible pieces of beetroot, cut into medium-sized chunks. Comparing them to the plate size and adjacent items, such as the tomato slices and quinoa, each beetroot chunk appears to be about 2-3 cm in size with a solid density. Beetroot is a dense vegetable, so these pieces likely weigh more than they appear volumetrically. The total volume of beetroot occupies about one-sixth of the plate surface, and considering the depth under the pieces, I estimate an effective thickness of 1.5-2 cm for the pile. Based on density and portion size calibration for a medium side of cooked beetroot, the range would be approximately 70-100 grams. Given the quantity and chunk size shown here, I assess the total weight at about 85 grams for the beetroot portion on this plate."

The image shows a plate with a mixed salad containing rice, cherry tomatoes, peach pieces, corn, asparagus, tuna, kidney beans, and one boiled egg cut in half. The target food item is ""oeuf"" (egg). I locate the egg pieces near the top right of the plate: two halves of a boiled egg with visible yolk and white. Considering the size relative to the plate and other ingredients, this seems to be a medium-sized cooked egg. A typical medium boiled egg weighs about 50 grams including shell, but without the shell it weighs approximately 45 grams. Since there is no shell visible and the egg is fully present in halves, I estimate the egg white and yolk combined weight in the plate to be about 45 grams."

The image shows a bowl of porridge with toppings including raspberries, blueberries (myrtilles), dark chocolate chips, and a dollop of peanut butter. I focus only on the blueberries for estimation. Step 1: Visual Identification - The blueberries are located on the left side of the bowl mixed with raspberries. They are whole and countable. I count approximately 11 blueberries visible. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each blueberry is about 1.5 to 1.8 cm in diameter based on comparison to the hand holding the bowl and the porridge grains. They appear medium sized and fresh. Step 3: Density Considerations - Blueberries have a density approximately around 0.6 to 0.7 grams per berry on average for medium size. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Using a medium weight of 0.65 grams per blueberry and 11 berries estimated, total weight is about 7.15 grams. Rounding conservatively due to some berries partially hidden or irregular size, I estimate total weight between 7 to 9 grams. Selecting a median value, I estimate the total weight of the blueberries to be about 8 grams."

The target food item 'vinaigre' is visible as a light dressing spread thinly over the vegetables and seeds in the bowl. Vinegar is a liquid and typically used sparingly in salads, mostly as a dressing component. It is spread in a thin layer and does not gather volume like solid foods. Comparing the amount of visible vinaigre to the size of the vegetables (cucumber, tomato, carrot) and pumpkin seeds, the vinaigre quantity is minimal, probably just a few small spoonfuls equivalent to a light coating. Considering a typical small salad portion in Swiss context, the vinaigre here likely weighs around 5 grams, as more would be visible as liquid puddles or thicker pools. Therefore, 5 grams is a reasonable and accurate estimation based on visual evidence."

The image shows a single scoop of vanilla ice cream ('boule de glace vanille') placed in a white bowl alongside chocolate sauce and some strawberry-rhubarb compote. For a visual size reference, the bowl is a standard small dessert bowl, and the ice cream scoop appears to be a typical dessert ball approximately 5 to 6 cm in diameter. Considering the usual density of vanilla ice cream and typical serving sizes in Swiss context, a single scoop weighs around 60 to 80 grams. The scoop looks medium-sized, not small nor unusually large. Based on these observations and accounting for its slightly melting texture which doesn't add weight, I estimate the scoop of vanilla ice cream to be approximately 70 grams."

The target food item is 'thon' (tuna) in the image. Visually, the tuna is mixed in chunks throughout the couscous salad, appearing as light pinkish flakes and pieces scattered evenly. I count approximately 8-10 visible chunks of tuna, each roughly 1-2 cm in size. The tuna pieces are not densely packed but distributed with some volume hidden beneath the top layer. Comparing the glass container and the size of the cucumber chunks (which appear to be around 2-3 cm each), the tuna pieces are moderately sized but fewer in number. Tuna is dense and compact, so the chunks pack weight even if small. Considering the volume of tuna visible and the depth of the container filled with the salad, the total tuna weight likely lies between 70 to 100 grams. Given the portion looks medium-sized and the mixing is consistent, a conservative estimate near the middle of the range at 85 grams is reasonable."

The image shows a single chocolate chip cookie placed on a wooden surface. Visually, the cookie is approximately 7-8 cm in diameter based on the texture and grain of the wood, which suggests a small to medium-sized cookie typical in Swiss household portions. The cookie is relatively flat but has some thickness, estimated around 1-1.5 cm. It contains several visible chocolate chunks which add to the density and weight. Cookies generally have a moderate density due to flour and sugar content combined with chocolate. Considering Swiss portions tend to be smaller than US portions, and estimating a typical medium cookie of this size and density weighs between 35 to 50 grams, I lean towards the middle of this range due to the visible size and chocolate chunks. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this cookie to be approximately 42 grams."

The image shows a plate with four food items: two folded wraps, diced tomatoes, diced avocado, and scrambled egg pieces at the bottom left. The target food item to estimate is 'oeuf' (egg), which here is scrambled and portioned in a small pile. Visually, the scrambled egg appears to occupy roughly a small palm-sized area, with some thickness suggesting it is a thin layer rather than a thick scoop. Comparing the size of the egg to the wrap above and the tomato pieces beside it, it looks like about half of a medium egg was used. A whole medium egg weighs about 50 grams; since this appears to be roughly half, the weight estimate is around 25 grams. Considering slight loss due to cooking (moisture evaporation) and portion slightly less than half an egg, a conservative estimate is between 20-25 grams. Therefore, based on visual volume, density of cooked scrambled eggs, and Swiss portion context, I estimate the weight of the scrambled 'oeuf' on the plate to be approximately 23 grams."

The mayonnaise is visible on the left side of the plate as a small dollop of white creamy sauce. Comparing the size of the mayonnaise portion to the fork and other foods on the plate, it appears to be a modest serving likely scooped by a spoon. The volume looks roughly equivalent to about a tablespoon, which in Swiss portion context typically translates to about 15 grams of mayonnaise. Mayonnaise is quite dense and creamy, so 15 grams is a reasonable estimate for this visible portion without including any container weight."

The image shows a piece of bread ('pain') with a layer of chestnut cream ('crème de marrons') spread on top. The target food to estimate is 'crème de marrons', which covers the visible surface of the bread in a spread form. The spread is uneven but appears to be a thin to moderate layer about 2-3 mm thick on average. Given the size of the bread piece (about the size of a small bread slice gap, roughly 8 cm in length and 3-4 cm width), the total spread area is roughly 25-30 cm². Chestnut cream is dense and sticky, so its density is relatively high, about 0.9 to 1.0 g/cm³. Multiplying the approximate volume (area × thickness) and density gives an estimated weight range of 20-30 grams. Considering the moderate spread with some thinner spots, I place the estimated weight closer to the mid-range, around 25 grams of crème de marrons."

The target food item is 'sauce oignons.' Visually, the sauce is the reddish-brown onion topping placed over the slices of roast meat ('rôti') on the plate. The onions appear to be sliced thinly and cooked down in a sauce, covering roughly half of two roast slices. Given the spread and pooling of the sauce around the meat edges and partially on the plate, the visible volume suggests a moderate portion. Onion sauces are dense but not heavy in volume. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes and using the roast slices (approx. 90-100 grams each) as reference for scale, the sauce weight is likely around 35-45 grams. Choosing the middle ground given the visible amount, the estimated weight of the 'sauce oignons' is approximately 40 grams."

The target food item is 'houmous au basilic (acheté)' visible in a small clear glass placed above the plate. The glass contains a small portion of thick, creamy hummus with visible green basil flecks. Comparing the glass size to the plate and carrot sticks, it appears to hold roughly 2-3 spoonfuls of hummus. Given the density of store-bought hummus, which is thick and compact, a typical tablespoon weighs about 15 grams. Visually, there appear to be around 3 tablespoons of hummus in the glass, totaling about 45 grams. Considering the Swiss portion context which tends to be smaller than US portions, and visual fullness of the glass, a realistic estimate is around 40-50 grams. Choosing the mid-range value gives a reasonable estimation of 45 grams for the portion of houmous au basilic."

The image shows a single round slice of lemon ('rondelle de citron') floating on top of a glass of water. The lemon slice appears to be a thin, circular slice taken from a typical lemon which is about 5-6 cm in diameter. The thickness of the slice seems to be around 3-5 mm. Considering the visible peel and pulp, and comparing it to the size of the standard glass, the slice appears to be a normal portion size. A single lemon slice of this dimension normally weighs between 5 to 8 grams due to the water content and density of lemon. Given the thinness and diameter, as well as Swiss portion context, I estimate the weight of the lemon slice to be around 6.5 grams."

The target food item is 'mais' (corn). On the white plate, the corn portion is visible as a small, separate pile of yellow kernels located next to the chickpeas. The corn portion covers roughly a small quarter of the plate and is relatively flat, suggesting a shallow depth. Given that corn kernels are quite dense, the volume visible corresponds to a moderate weight. Comparing to the size of the fork and the broccoli florets, this corn portion likely weighs between 40 and 60 grams. It is not piled high, and the kernels are not spread very thickly, suggesting closer to a smaller-medium portion size. Taking Swiss portion context into account, I estimate the weight of the corn to be about 50 grams."

The target food item is 'graines de courge' (pumpkin seeds) visible within a glass container that also contains couscous, tuna, and cucumber pieces. Step 1: Locating the pumpkin seeds visually, they appear as small dark green seeds scattered intermittently throughout the dish, partially mixed within the couscous grains and pieces of tuna and cucumber. Step 2: Dimension analysis shows these seeds are small and flat, about a few millimeters each, but the quantity is relatively sparse - probably less than a tablespoon in volume, considering the distributed appearance rather than a dense layer. Step 3: Pumpkin seeds are dense and heavy for their size. A tablespoon of shelled pumpkin seeds weighs roughly 9-10 grams. The visible amount looks closer to about half a tablespoon given the coverage here, roughly 4-5 grams. Step 4: Considering the overall portion scale in the rectangular container and the quantity within, this estimate is reasonable and not exaggerated. Step 5: Cross-validation - pumpkin seeds are rarely present in large amounts here and visual evidence does not support a heavier quantity. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'graines de courge' in this dish to be approximately 5 grams."

The image shows one small slice of toasted bread (tartine) with visible spreading of both butter and chestnut cream (crème de marrons). The tartine occupies a small portion of a standard-sized white plate, suggesting it is a thin slice, roughly 8-10 cm in length. The bread slice appears light, as toast is usually low in moisture and density, likely around 25-30 grams for this small portion. The butter spread is thin and patchy, probably about 3-5 grams, considering portion size and visible coverage. The chestnut cream spread is more substantial but still thin, likely about 8-12 grams, given its glossy texture and coverage area. Combining these, the total weight of the tartine with its spread toppings (but focusing only on the tartine itself as the specified item) is approximately the weight of the bread slice alone, since the target food is 'tartine avec crème de marrons et beurre' implying the entire tartine including spreads. Therefore, adding all these together and considering Swiss portion size, a reasonable estimate is around 38 grams total. This accounts for the light bread, thin butter, and moderate chestnut cream. Hence, the best estimate for the tartine with chestnut cream and butter is 38 grams."

The target food item is 'avocat' (avocado). In the image, the avocado is sliced into two fairly thick slices positioned on a galette wrap. Each slice appears to be about 7 to 8 cm long and roughly 2.5 cm wide, with visible thickness suggesting around 1.5 cm depth. This corresponds to about a quarter of a medium avocado. Avocado density is moderate due to its creamy texture and fat content, with an average density close to 1g/cm3. Typical medium avocado weighs around 150 grams. A quarter of that is approximately 37.5 grams. The slices are visibly fresh and without peel, so no extra weight. Considering Swiss portion sizes tend to be smaller, the avocado portion here looks slightly less than a quarter. Therefore, estimating slightly below the quarter size, I assign the avocado portion a conservative weight of around 30 grams."

The item is roughly the size of a small pastry bite, approximately 3-4 cm in length, 2-3 cm in width, and about 2 cm thick. It appears to be a puff pastry that is baked with a tomato sauce filling visible in the swirled structure. Puff pastry is light but the tomato sauce adds some moisture and density. Given the size and density, this is a small, snack-sized portion typical in Swiss context, where portions tend to be conservative. Considering puff pastry density and the likely tomato sauce filling, a small feuilleté is likely between 25 and 35 grams.

The cookie appears quite thick with visible chunks of chocolate, indicating a dense and rich composition. Typical homemade cookies of this size usually weigh between 40 and 60 grams depending on thickness and ingredients. Considering the cookie's substantial thickness and dense chocolate chunks, I estimate the weight to be toward the higher end of this range. Therefore, a reasonable estimation for the weight of this cookie is around 55 grams."

The image shows a single peeled carrot lying on a countertop. The carrot is whole, and based on the visible length and thickness, it appears to be an average medium-sized carrot. Common peeled carrots of this size generally weigh between 70 and 100 grams. Since the carrot here looks moderately thick and about 12-15 cm long, its density as a raw vegetable supports this weight range. It is not unusually large or small, so I estimate a medium portion weight. Therefore, the estimated weight of this peeled carrot is approximately 85 grams."

The target food is 'sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon)', which is the creamy mushroom sauce visible mixed with pasta. Step 1: The sauce is identifiable by the mushroom pieces coated in a creamy texture. There are about 7-8 visible mushroom pieces that are well-coated with the white creamy sauce. Step 2: The bowl size and portion of the sauce can be estimated relative to the pasta. The sauce appears to be spread evenly around the mushrooms and some pasta, but the sauce itself is thin, not overly thick nor piled. The mushrooms are medium size, roughly 3-4 cm length each, and the sauce volume is mostly coating these mushrooms and some pasta strands. Step 3: Mushroom density is moderate, and cream sauce adds to the weight but is relatively light compared to dense solids. Step 4: Given that there are about 7 mushrooms and creamy sauce coating them, estimating about 10 grams per mushroom plus about 20 grams of cream sauce around the dish, the total weight of the sauce (mushrooms + cream and garlic) is estimated around 90 to 120 grams. Considering the portion size shown is medium, I estimate about 105 grams total for the sauce aux champignons."

This segment appears to be around 7-9 cm long with average thickness for a banana of about 3.5-4 cm in diameter. Bananas have a firm, dense texture, so the density is quite high. A typical medium banana weighs about 120-150 grams whole. Since this piece is roughly half the banana without any peel, which contributes to weight, I estimate the weight of this peeled banana segment to be around 65-75 grams.

Comparing the yogurt pot to the apple beside it, the pot's height is about twice the apple's diameter, which aligns with common pots of approximately 125 grams for natural yogurt servings in Switzerland. There is no visible spillage or indication that the pot is not full. Therefore, based on the typical portion size and visual confirmation, I estimate the weight of the 'yaourt nature' to be 125 grams."

The target food item is 'sauce curry avec mayonnaise.' Looking at the image, the sandwich contains a visible thin spread of yellow sauce on the inner sides of the baguette bread, underneath the chicken and lettuce. The sauce is applied as a thin layer, roughly covering the length of each half sandwich. Given the small to medium size of the baguette halves (about 12-15 cm each) and the thin coating of the sauce spread, the volume is limited. Typically, a thin spread of sauce like curry mayonnaise in a sandwich amounts to around 10-15 grams per half, yielding roughly 20-30 grams total for both halves combined. Since the target food is likely referring to the total amount of sauce in the entire sandwich portion visible, and because the sauce coverage is not thick or overflowing, I estimate the total weight of the curry mayonnaise sauce to be around 25 grams."

The image shows two small solid milk chocolate figures shaped like rabbits placed on a flat surface. Each chocolate figure appears to be about 4-5 cm tall and roughly 2-3 cm wide and deep, comparable to small molded chocolates typically sold in Swiss stores. Given their solid form and dense nature of milk chocolate, each rabbit likely weighs between 15 and 25 grams. Since the request is for one specified food item 'chocolat' and there are two rabbits visible, I will estimate the weight of one piece only. Considering the medium size and typical density of this type of chocolate figurine, I estimate the weight of one chocolate rabbit to be approximately 20 grams."
ppf8hc,chocolat noir,18.0,12.0,6.0,0.01151140481773609,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/1f280cd7-2448-47d9-a198-235eb8d19e29,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single piece of dark chocolate ('chocolat noir'). It appears to be part of a chocolate bar with a recognizable shape and thickness typical of a Swiss portion of dark chocolate. Given the visible size, compared to a common chocolate piece which usually weighs around 10 to 15 grams, and considering this piece is slightly irregular but mostly intact, the estimated weight would be around 12 grams, balancing the irregular edge and standard size."

The image shows a white bowl containing milk and cereal pieces that are clumped and irregular in shape, spread mostly on one side of the bowl. The cereal pieces are chunky and clustered, with some pieces partially submerged in milk, indicating some depth but not a full pile. The bowl size compared to a regular spoon in the image suggests a medium-size bowl. The cereal cluster covers roughly one third of the bowl's bottom area, and the thickness of the cereal layer seems modest, about 1-2 centimeters tall. Granola or clusters typically have a density around 0.4 to 0.5 g/cm³. Given the cereal pile volume estimated visually at about 125-150 ml, the weight would likely be around 50-70 grams. Considering the cereal looks like a moderate portion in Swiss context (smaller than US), I estimate the weight of the cereals alone to be around 60 grams."
m4egh2,yogourt orange sanguine,170.0,165.0,5.0,0.09059901939884886,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/9942fa79-be93-458e-b6a9-22fda9333ff4,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'yogourt orange sanguine,' which is the blood orange flavored yogurt visible as the creamy liquid mixed throughout the bowl containing the mélange de céréales and myrtilles. The yogurt appears to be the binding and liquid base surrounding the cereal flakes and blueberries. The bowl is medium-sized, and the yogurt seems to fill much of the visible volume, estimated at about 2/3 to 3/4 of the bowl's content by volume (with cereals and blueberries making up the rest). Given the density of yogurt (around 1 g/ml) and the approximate depth of the contents in the bowl (around 3-4 cm depth in a bowl roughly 15 cm in diameter), I estimate the yogurt volume at about 150-180 ml, which translates roughly to 150-180 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizing and that the yogurt is mixed and not poured in excess, a medium estimate would be about 165 grams. This accounts for some yogurt absorbed into cereal and slight variability in the volume occupied by other mix-ins. No container weight included, only the yogurt content. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'yogourt orange sanguine' to be approximately 165 grams."

The target food item is 'vinaigre balsamique' visible as a dark brown liquid drizzled on top of the salad in the small white bowl. Its amount is limited as it is a dressing, seen as several small pools and streaks on the surface, not filling the bowl. The bowl is roughly 10-12 cm in diameter, and the vinegar covers parts of the salad with a thin layer. Balsamic vinegar has a density close to water (~1 g/ml), so volume corresponds directly to weight. Visually, the total volume of vinegar appears to be about 1 to 1.5 tablespoons, which is about 15-22 ml, equating approximately to 15-22 grams. Considering a typical Swiss portion of salad dressing and the visual evidence of shallow coverage with small pools, the sauce is likely on the lower side of that range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'vinaigre balsamique' to be approximately 18 grams."

The target food item, 'boulgour', is located in the bottom left part of the rectangular glass container. It occupies about one third of the container's base area, with a depth that appears consistent with a single layer of cooked bulgur, somewhat fluffy but compacted. Considering the size of the container, which is roughly a standard meal prep container (approximately 15x15 cm), the bulgur portion looks moderate. Cooked bulgur is dense but light compared to rice or pasta. Estimating the volume around 350-400 ml and accounting for cooked bulgur density (~1 g/ml), the weight is likely in the 150-180 gram range. Considering Swiss portions tend to be on the smaller side and the bulgur fills less than half the container volume, I choose an estimate near the middle of this range, about 165 grams, as a reasonable and visually grounded approximation."

The image shows a hand holding a visible handful of cashew nuts ('noix de cajou'). Counting the pieces, there are approximately 18 whole or nearly whole cashew nuts. Each cashew nut typically weighs around 1.3 to 1.5 grams depending on size. These cashews appear medium-sized, and the palm's size serves as a reliable reference for their average weight. Since cashews are dense nuts, their weight can be estimated confidently by number. Multiplying 18 nuts by about 1.4 grams per nut gives approximately 25 grams total. Given this is a standard small handful and considering the slight variations in nut size, an estimate around 25 grams is reasonable."

The image shows a white plastic container filled with a Greek salad ('salade grecque'). The salad contains small diced pieces of cucumber, tomato, yellow and green bell pepper, onion rings, black olives, and small chunks of white cheese (likely feta). The container is roughly a small to medium-sized takeout container, about 12 cm long and 8 cm wide. The salad fills roughly three-quarters of the container's depth, which appears to be about 6 cm deep overall, so the salad volume is approximately 12 x 8 x 4.5 cm = 432 cubic centimeters. Greek salad ingredients like vegetables and feta cheese have moderate density, roughly around 0.7 to 0.9 g/cm³, so I will use an average density of 0.8 g/cm³. Multiplying the volume by the density gives an estimated weight of about 346 grams. Considering the container is not fully full to the brim and some air gaps exist between ingredients, I adjust downward slightly. Additionally, Swiss portion sizes are smaller, so I estimate a medium portion. Therefore, the estimated weight of the salade grecque in the container is approximately 310 grams."

The target food item is the 'purée cacahuète' (peanut butter puree) visible on the plate. In the image, the peanut butter puree is a creamy spread-like portion on the lower left side of the plate, separate from the oats, banana slice, and chocolate chips. Visually, it looks like a small dollop about the size of a tablespoon, not a large pile but enough to cover a small area of the black plate. Given that peanut butter is dense and sticky, a tablespoon typically weighs around 15 grams. The portion looks close to one tablespoon or slightly less, but it is not a mere smear and has some depth. Given Swiss portion sizes tend to be smaller than US ones, I estimate the peanut butter portion here as a medium small serving, roughly between 12 to 16 grams. Thus, I estimate the weight of the peanut butter puree to be approximately 14 grams."

The target food item is 'oignon' (onion). The image shows a slice of bread topped with ham, balsamic cream, and chopped green onion pieces. The green onion pieces are scattered on the ham and appear fresh and crisp. They are small in size, around 1-2 cm long each, and there are about 10 visible pieces in total. Considering green onions are light and low density compared to other vegetables, and the pieces are chopped relatively finely, the total volume isn't large. The depth/thickness corresponds to small rings cut and scattered. A reasonable density for green onions is about 0.5 g/cm3 given their hollow tubular structure. Estimating total mass from the visible volume and pieces, the weight is low, roughly between 3 and 7 grams. Given the portion size on the plate looks modest but complete, and considering the Swiss context for smaller portions, I estimate the weight of 'oignon' here to be approximately 5 grams."

The image shows a single croissant au chocolat held in a person's hand on a small paper tray. The croissant looks flaky and moderately sized, typical of a Swiss bakery smaller portion than US standards. The visible size compares to about 12-13 cm length and around 6-7 cm in width, with some thickness given the puff pastry layers. The chocolate filling is partially visible at the bitten corner, indicating some density inside but mostly light flaky layers outside. Considering the dense pastry with some chocolate but no heavy fillings, standard Swiss portions of similar croissants usually weigh between 70 and 100 grams. This particular croissant seems medium-sized, near the middle range. Therefore, I estimate the croissant au chocolat weighs approximately 85 grams."

The target food item is 'graines de chia' (chia seeds). In the image, the chia seeds are mixed within a creamy white mixture (likely blanc battu) along with oat flakes and honey. Visually, the chia seeds appear well distributed but in relatively small quantity compared to the total volume of the bowl. The bowl seems to be a small to medium-sized standard cereal bowl, holding roughly 200-250 grams of total mixture. Given that chia seeds are small and dense but occupy a minor proportion of the mixture visually, their amount is likely around 10 to 15 grams, as they are usually added in small amounts as a supplement. Considering visual density and portion size typical in Swiss context, I estimate the 'graines de chia' weight in this bowl to be approximately 12 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing several pieces of white asparagus and a dollop of mayonnaise labeled as 'mayonnaise thomy'. The mayonnaise is smooth and creamy with a medium-sized dollop, approximately 3 cm in diameter and about 1.5 cm thick. Comparing the mayonnaise portion to typical serving spoons and the asparagus size, the mayonnaise appears to be about 15-20 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes, this portion is moderate, not overly generous, nor small. Therefore, the mayonnaise thomy portion likely weighs around 18 grams."

The target food item is 'yogourt nature' which is the plain yogurt visible as a white spread on one slice of whole grain bread. The slice of bread appears to be of a typical small Swiss size, roughly 10 cm by 6-7 cm. The yogurt layer looks smooth and moderately thick, covering almost the entire visible surface of the bread. Since the yogurt is spread and not piled, we need to estimate an average thickness of about 0.5 cm. Calculating the volume: approximately 10 cm × 6.5 cm × 0.5 cm = 32.5 cm³. Plain yogurt density is close to water, around 1 g/cm³, so the yogurt weight is roughly equal to its volume in grams. This gives us about 32-33 grams of yogurt on the bread. Considering some margin for uneven spread, I estimate 33 grams as a reasonable weight for the 'yogourt nature' spread on the bread."

The target food item is 'tomates'. In the image, there are roughly 8 visible tomato pieces scattered over the plate. Each tomato piece is cut into small chunks about 3-4 cm in size, with some depth. Comparing the tomato pieces' size to the cucumber pieces and the plate diameter (standard small plate ~20 cm), the total volume is modest but fairly dense. Tomato flesh is juicy but has moderate density, roughly 0.9 g/cm³. Accounting for visible pieces plus some internal volume due to chunk thickness, the total weight range is about 40-60 grams, typical for a small salad serving. Considering the moderate portion size visible on the plate, I estimate the tomate weight to be approximately 50 grams."

The image shows an open sandwich made with two slices of pain bis bread. The left slice is spread with mayonnaise, and the right slice has slices of cheese and two cornichons. Focusing on the mayonnaise, it appears to be spread thinly and evenly over the entire slice of bread, covering the surface without thick dollops. A medium slice of pain bis bread in Switzerland weighs about 40-45 grams, and a typical light spread of mayonnaise on one slice is usually around 10-15 grams. Considering the thin, even application visible, the mayonnaise is closer to the lower to middle part of that range. Therefore, an estimate of 12 grams of mayonnaise is reasonable for this portion size."

The image shows a glass bottle filled partially with shelled peanuts (cacahuètes). The bottle appears to be a small standard container roughly the size of a small milk bottle, giving a good size reference. The peanuts fill approximately one-third of the bottle's volume. Typically, peanuts have a density such that 1 ml equals about 0.55 grams. Estimating the bottle's volume at about 250 ml, one-third volume filled corresponds to roughly 80 ml of peanuts. Multiplying 80 ml by 0.55 g/ml gives approximately 44 grams. Considering the Swiss smaller portion context and some air gaps between peanuts, a conservative estimate is about 40 grams for the shelled peanuts inside the bottle, excluding the container weight."

The target food item is 'avocat' (avocado), visible as a single sliced piece on the plate. It looks like roughly one quarter of a medium avocado, showing a thick, dense flesh portion typical of avocado. Considering Swiss portion sizes, a whole medium avocado typically weighs around 150 grams with about 70-80% edible flesh, so the edible flesh is approximately 105-120 grams per whole avocado. This quarter slice likely weighs about 25-30 grams, adjusted for the thickness and density visible in the slice. The avocado piece is not spread thin but solid and about 3-4 cm thick. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the avocado portion on the plate to be approximately 28 grams."

The image shows a piece of 'pain aux fruits' held between fingers, providing a clear size reference. The bread piece is roughly palm-sized but appears relatively dense and thick, typical of fruit bread. Visible nuts and salt crystals on top add to its weight and density. Given the compact nature of this type of bread, with embedded fruits and nuts, and an approximate size about 7-8 cm wide and 3-4 cm thick, the weight can be estimated by comparison to known small fruit bread portions. Typical small portions of fruit bread in Switzerland weigh between 80 and 120 grams depending on thickness and ingredient density. This piece appears moderately thick and dense but not very large, so a medium portion estimate around 100 grams is reasonable."

The image shows a small portion of green salad leaves with some visible dressing or sauce on a white plate. The salad consists of about 8 individual pieces or leaves of green lettuce, which are relatively thin and light. Compared to the plate size and visible dressing container in the background, the portion appears very small, possibly leftovers. Considering lettuce density which is low (light and mostly water), a typical small leaf weighs around 2-3 grams. For 8 leaves, that totals about 16-24 grams. Given the portion size is small and not densely packed, I estimate the total weight of the salade verte avec sauce to be approximately 20 grams, excluding the plate and any container weight."

The egg white is fully cooked and spread out with an average thickness typical for a fried egg, around 2-3 mm thick, with the yolk intact in the center. Considering the plate size and comparing the fried egg to the volume of the other food items, the egg appears to be a standard large egg portion without any visible additions or modifications. A large cooked fried egg typically weighs around 50 grams net (without shell). Given the visual evidence and the Swiss portion size context, the portion is medium-sized, so I estimate the weight of the oeuf au plat to be approximately 50 grams."

The target food item is 'tonic au gingembre,' which in the image corresponds to a clear glass bottle labeled 'GINGER.' The bottle is almost full, with a small amount consumed. The glass bottle itself is about the size of a regular small beverage bottle, approximately 200-250 ml in volume, common for tonic or ginger beer drinks. Since the liquid density is close to water (about 1 g/ml), the weight of the liquid tonic inside is roughly equal to its volume in grams. Given the bottle is roughly 80% full and estimating the bottle size to be about 250 ml, the tonic inside weighs around 200 grams. Containers are excluded, so only the liquid content is counted. Therefore, the estimated weight of the tonic au gingembre is approximately 200 grams."

The target food is the 'galette wraps,' visible as the flat round wrap on a plate. The wrap is fully visible with no parts folded or hidden. The diameter of the wrap is about the size of a standard small plate (approximately 20-22 cm). Given the thinness and appearance, it resembles a typical whole grain or buckwheat galette wrap. Such wraps in Swiss portion sizes usually weigh between 50 and 70 grams. This one appears to be a medium portion, not overly thick but with some texture visible. Considering these factors, the estimated weight is around 65 grams."

The image shows an open sandwich with slices of 'fromage' (cheese) placed on one half of a slice of pain bis bread. There are around 6 thin rectangular strips of cheese, which seem to cover the surface with minimal overlap. Using the length and width of the bread slice as a reference (which is roughly 12 cm by 7 cm), the cheese slices appear to be thin and about 0.5 cm thick, typical of sliced cheese. Considering the density of cheese (approximately 1.1 g/cm3) and the visible surface area covered, the total cheese volume is estimated at about 30-40 cm3. This corresponds to a weight range of 33-44 grams. Given the modest thickness and coverage, the portion is closer to a medium portion size. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the fromage to be approximately 38 grams."
