ppf8hc,boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate,316.0,112.0,204.0,6.857142857142857,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/bf22a1b3-a8b6-4823-a44b-0893c3097763,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is ""boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate"" visible on the plate. Step 1: Visual Identification - There are 9 visible vegetable meatballs (boulettes) on and around the pasta. They are circular, roughly uniform in size. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each boulettes looks approximately 3-4 cm in diameter. Compared to the pasta penne pieces (which are usually about 4 cm long), these boulettes are approximately spherical balls of about 3 cm diameter. Considering depth and volume, they are dense and compact, coated with tomato sauce adding minor weight. Step 3: Density Considerations - Being vegetable-based meatballs, they have a medium density, somewhat lighter than meat but heavier than pasta. I estimate about 0.9 g/cm³ density for each boulettes. Volume of one boulettes = 4/3 * π * (1.5)^3 ≈ 14.1 cm³. Weight per boulettes ≈ 14.1 * 0.9 ≈ 12.7 grams. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - 9 boulettes × 12.7 g = 114 grams approximately. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Comparing the volume of boulettes to pasta portion (which looks like about 120-140 grams cooked), the boulettes volume and weight seems reasonable, about equal or slightly less than the pasta portion. Step 6: Bias Check - There is some sauce on them but I exclude it's weight beyond coating. No visible parts hidden or missing. Therefore, I estimate total weight of the vegetable meatballs to be approximately 110-115 grams. Choosing a middle value, my final estimate is 112 grams."
2ahgvr,porridge salé,48.0,240.0,192.0,0.980321242421019,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a35f3211-3b33-4826-97b8-3af69655dada,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item 'porridge salé' is contained in a small glass jar with a metal lid. The jar appears to be about 7 cm in diameter according to the lid measurement. The porridge fills almost the entire jar volume, reaching close to the top but not overflowing. Visually, the porridge looks creamy and thick with visible oat grains, and the jar depth is approximately 6-7 cm. Given the jar size relative to the common car dashboard elements and the density of cooked savory porridge (similar to cooked oat porridge which is dense and moist), the total porridge volume would be approximately 230-250 ml. Cooked porridge density is roughly close to water, about 1 g/ml, so weight closely matches volume. Considering it is a small serving, between 230 and 250 grams is realistic. Thus I conservatively estimate the weight of the porridge salé to be 240 grams, acknowledging a slight margin for moisture and oat density."
2ahgvr,salade grecque,315.0,500.0,185.0,6.198808637379003,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/c476a6d0-acb2-45fd-b168-84822bc98003,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a rectangular plastic container with a mixed Greek salad (salade grecque) inside. The salad consists of small diced pieces of vegetables such as cucumber, tomato, yellow bell pepper, and some pieces of white cheese (likely feta), as well as a few olives. The salad appears to be roughly half to two-thirds full in the container. Given the size of the container (roughly the size of a typical takeaway container, about 15 cm length, 10 cm width, and filled about 4 cm in depth), the volume occupied by the salad should be approximately 600 cubic centimeters. Greek salad is composed mostly of fresh vegetables and cheese with some dressing, which combined have a density close to 1g/cm3. Considering some dressing and moisture but also air gaps between pieces, the density might slightly be less. Therefore, the weight estimate for this portion of salade grecque is around 600 grams, but given the container is not fully filled and some air spaces, I estimate a slightly lower value, about 500 grams total. Since the target is just the salade grecque without any external dressing container, this figure applies fully to the salad inside. The sauce à salade maison is presumably mixed in or separate, but since the target is salade grecque, the estimate is 500 grams."
p96w4a,délice tomate mozzarella,54.0,230.0,176.0,1.010956281246676,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/5ebafbd6-315d-44a6-8508-ba143d23adb2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a neatly arranged délice tomate mozzarella on a white plate. It consists of alternating slices of tomato and mozzarella cheese, topped with herbs and balsamic vinegar. There are 7 visible slices of tomato and 6 slices of mozzarella, layered. The tomato slices are medium thickness, roughly 1-1.5 cm each, and tomatoes have a density of about 0.95 g/cm3, while mozzarella is denser, roughly 1.1 g/cm3. Visually, the whole stack is about 15 cm long and 6 cm wide, with a thickness averaging about 2.5 cm (since the slices overlap slightly). Considering the volume, this is roughly a cylinder-like shape of 15 cm x 6 cm x 2.5 cm, which is 225 cm3 approximately. Since the volume includes both tomato and mozzarella, and they alternate roughly equally, about half the volume is tomato and half mozzarella. For the tomato half, volume would be about 112.5 cm3 x 0.95 g/cm3 ≈ 107 g. For the mozzarella half, 112.5 cm3 x 1.1 g/cm3 ≈ 124 g. Total estimated mass would then be around 230-235 grams. Since this is a typical Swiss portion that looks appropriately sized, and the density estimations are standard, I estimate the weight of the délice tomate mozzarella to be approximately 230 grams."
p8a2w5,dahl de lentille,281.0,150.0,131.0,3.9156472715668547,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/5ddea52e-8411-4822-893f-d8420fa6cb40,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small to medium-sized bowl containing a mixture of rice and dahl de lentille. The dahl is orange-reddish with visible lentils and pieces of carrots and onions mixed in, layered on top of a smaller quantity of white rice at the bottom. The portion occupies roughly two-thirds to three-quarters of the bowl's depth, which is about the size of a standard small bowl (approximately 12 cm diameter). Rice and dahl are dense foods, so the visual volume translates to relatively significant weight. Given Swiss portion context, this is a moderate portion size. Considering the density, the visible volume, and the relative amount of dahl mixed throughout, I estimate the dahl portion weight alone at around 150 grams, accounting for some mixture with rice but focusing specifically on the dahl portion which is dominant. This estimation acknowledges the vegetables and lentils present, and the moist, cooked density of the dish. Therefore, the weight of the dahl de lentille is estimated to be 150 grams."
xjvrtk,tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe,250.0,125.0,125.0,3.324114455908946,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/f607625b-a07d-423e-a564-4d96ebadf084,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single slice of tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe on a small to medium-sized plate. The slice is roughly triangular, about one eighth of a typical tarte flambée pie, which usually measures around 24-26 cm in diameter. The topping consists of small, evenly distributed pieces of rhubarb and thin slices of apple, baked into a creamy base spread thinly over a crispy, thin crust. The crust is thin and light, typical of tarte flambée, contributing minimally to weight. The rhubarb pieces are dense but small, and the apple slices thin and cooked, contributing some moisture and weight but still relatively light. Given the thinness of the crust, moderate topping density, and portion size, and using Swiss portion context which is generally smaller, I estimate the weight of this slice to be in the range of 110-140 grams. I lean toward a middle value due to moderate topping coverage and typical slice thickness. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe slice to be approximately 125 grams."
xjvrtk,ananas,200.0,315.0,115.0,2.446548239548984,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/b41068f9-5a0e-4c11-bf1b-7389d3917889,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a blue plate with several pieces of pineapple ('ananas') cut into thick triangular chunks. I count 14 pieces of pineapple in total. Each piece appears roughly 3-4 cm in length, about 2-3 cm wide at the base, and around 1.5-2 cm thick. Considering the compact density of pineapple and its juicy texture, each chunk likely weighs between 20 to 25 grams. Multiplying by 14 pieces gives a total weight range of approximately 280 to 350 grams. Given medium portion size and visible volume, I estimate the total pineapple weight to be around 315 grams."
p8a2w5,tarte aux fraises,164.0,50.0,114.0,1.9887246037655568,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/7b64b358-b611-4155-8e79-6f3ce5b4f11a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is a slice of tarte aux fraises, visible on a decorative plate. The slice shows roughly 6 large strawberry halves on top and some red currants embedded in the cream filling. Step 1: Counting the strawberries, there are 6 halves, roughly equivalent to 3 whole strawberries. Step 2: The strawberries are fresh, dense fruit. An average medium strawberry weighs about 15-20 grams, so 3 strawberries would be approximately 45-60 grams. Step 3: Considering the cream and pastry, only the strawberries themselves should be estimated here. Step 4: With slight partial coverage of cream on some strawberries, assume about 90% fruit volume is visible and weighted. Step 5: Adjusting for Swiss portion sizes and visual clues, strawberry weight on the slice is about 50 grams. Step 6: Cross-verifying the strawberry size relative to typical strawberry size confirms this estimate is reasonable. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'tarte aux fraises' strawberries alone is approximately 50 grams."
wrah5h,polenta,209.0,100.0,109.0,2.4232528454419744,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/f727ac79-973e-4b92-8f2b-cda94222d4a7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a metal container with three visible food components: grilled aubergine slices in the top left, a piece of pork topped with white sauce in the bottom left, and polenta on the right topped with a generous amount of shredded cheese. The target food item is 'polenta'. Visually, the polenta portion occupies roughly one third of the container's volume. The container is roughly rectangular and looks like a medium-sized lunch box, approximately 15cm wide. The polenta is dense, likely cooked, and topped with shredded cheese which adds extra weight but is separate from polenta itself. The polenta base looks like a mound roughly 7 cm long, 5 cm wide, and about 3 cm thick. Polenta is fairly dense (about 1.1g/cm3 cooked). Calculating estimated volume (7x5x3=105 cm3) and multiplying by density gives about 115g. Given the Swiss context and moderate portion size, and subtracting weight of cheese visible on top, the polenta alone likely weighs around 100 grams."
xjvrtk,courgette et oignons,300.0,200.0,100.0,3.191149877672588,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'courgette et oignons', visually identified on the left side of the glass container. The courgettes are sliced into medium-sized chunks mixed with onion pieces, both cooked and appearing soft and slightly moist. The container is small, approximately 12x12 cm square, common for meal prep portions. The courgette and onion portion occupies about half of the container volume, heaped but not overflowing. Considering the density of cooked courgettes and onions, which are moderately dense but retain water content reducing weight, the depth can be estimated around 3-4 cm. Visually, the portion is medium-sized by Swiss standards, not particularly large or small. Based on typical density roughly 0.8 g/cm3 for cooked mixed vegetables, and approximating volume as 12x6 cm x 3.5 cm deep = about 250 cm3. Multiplying volume by density gives approximately 200 grams. I consider this a reasonable internal weight range for a cooked vegetable portion of this size and type. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'courgette et oignons' to be about 200 grams."
wrah5h,porc,52.0,150.0,98.0,0.5420699925539836,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/f727ac79-973e-4b92-8f2b-cda94222d4a7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'porc'. In the image, the pork is located in the bottom left portion of the metal container, partially covered with a white sauce (likely the 'sauce blanche'). The piece looks like a single cooked pork chop or filet slice. It has a thickness of about 1.5 to 2 cm and a surface area roughly 8 cm by 7 cm. Visual cues from the size of the container (typical lunchbox size) and comparison to the aubergine slices indicate a medium portion of pork. Pork is a dense meat, so weight is significant for its volume. Based on these visual dimensions and density, a standard cooked pork portion of this size would generally weigh between 130 to 170 grams. Given the thickness and visible size, I estimate the pork piece weighs approximately 150 grams."
wrah5h,"délice des dieux (biscuit, fruits rouges, séré+mascarpone)",205.0,115.0,90.0,1.9625571747686417,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/5de398c7-684b-448d-ba0a-f318d009bccd,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a slice of 'délice des dieux', a layered dessert composed of biscuit base, red fruits, and a creamy layer of séré and mascarpone. The portion is on a small dessert plate, which gives a size reference: the slice is roughly 8 cm by 6 cm in surface area. The thickness of the slice is about 2.5 cm, including the biscuit and creamy topping. The biscuit layer appears moist and compact, typical of a dense sponge soaked with fruit juices. The fruits are integrated mostly in the biscuit layer (red color), with a few whole raspberries and blueberries on top. Considering the cream layer which is dense but light, and the biscuit base which is denser, I estimate an average density between a cake and a creamy dessert, approximately 0.9 to 1.0 g/cm3. Volume is roughly 8 cm × 6 cm × 2.5 cm = 120 cm3. Multiplying volume by density gives an estimated weight range of 108 to 120 grams. Since the portion appears average-sized (not too small or overly large), a medium portion leads me to select the mid value, approximately 115 grams. There is no container weight to consider, and the visible red fruits on top are included within the portion. Therefore, the weight of the 'délice des dieux' slice is estimated at around 115 grams."
wrah5h,tiramisu,72.0,160.0,88.0,0.6739708541644506,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/7b0475df-5b02-4072-abb9-ef75acf0f031,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a black plate with two different cakes, one being the tiramisu on the left side. The tiramisu portion is a thick slice, roughly 10 cm long, about 4-5 cm wide, and approximately 4 cm high. The tiramisu includes layers of soaked sponge cake and creamy mascarpone mixture, which is relatively dense but also somewhat light due to the cream. Considering these dimensions and densities, the weight should be moderate. The tiramisu is roughly the size of a typical Swiss individual dessert portion which usually weighs less than US portions. Taking into account the depth and density, the weight likely falls between 140 to 180 grams. Given the visual volume and cream content, I estimate the tiramisu portion weighs about 160 grams."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,330.0,87.0,3.859057547069461,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate containing a salad made primarily of sliced tomatoes with visible flax seeds (graines de lin) and a dressing likely containing balsamic vinegar. The target food item is 'salade de tomates.' Visually, the tomatoes are cut into medium-thick wedges and slices, filling about two-thirds of a small-medium plate. The plate diameter can be compared to the gilt cutlery next to it, suggesting a diameter around 20 cm, which is typical for a small dining plate. The tomato pieces are piled to a moderate depth of approximately 2-3 cm. Fresh tomatoes are dense and moist, with a density close to water (about 1g/cm³). Considering the volume estimated from the visible surface area (around 150 cm²) multiplied by depth (~2.5 cm), the tomato volume is roughly 375 cm³. This would equate to about 375 grams in weight. Taking into account some air gaps between pieces and slight volume reduction from absorption of dressing, I adjust the estimate slightly downward. Since vinaigre balsamique and flax seeds are very light and sprinkled, they do not add significant weight to the tomatoes themselves. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'salade de tomates' alone at about 330 grams, a medium portion size consistent with Swiss portions and plate size."
8japfq,ratatouille,196.0,110.0,86.0,1.793000744601638,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/b6659a8f-25e7-44f7-a351-7873f60f1586,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is ratatouille, which is located on the top right section of the plate. It appears as a diced vegetable stew including eggplant, zucchini, red pepper, and tomato-based sauce. Visually, it occupies a moderate volume on the plate, approximately the size of a medium spoonful piled to a depth of around 2-3 cm. Comparing the size of the ratatouille portion to the fried egg and the bed of bulgur, the ratatouille portion is roughly half the volume of the bulgur pile, which itself likely weighs around 120-140 grams given typical Swiss portion sizes. Ratatouille is cooked vegetables with medium density, retaining some moisture but not overly dense. Estimating density similar to cooked vegetables, roughly 0.8 g/cm3. The surface area is roughly 9 cm by 6 cm, depth about 2.5 cm, giving about 135 cm3 volume. Multiplying volume by density gives approximately 108 grams. Considering some visual distribution and slight underestimation or compactness, the ratatouille portion likely falls between 100 and 120 grams. Taking a medium-sized portion judgment, I estimate approximately 110 grams for the ratatouille on this plate."
6fwmw2,fraises,146.0,61.0,85.0,1.3200723327305606,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/6fwmw2/dish_media/fc43899a-21ef-45e8-95b0-d10af04f9539,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows three whole strawberries in a small green bowl. The strawberries appear to be medium to large-sized, with one notably larger than the others. Typically, a medium-sized Swiss strawberry weighs about 15-20 grams, while larger ones can reach up to 25 grams. Considering one is quite large and two are medium, I estimate their weights around 25 grams for the large strawberry and about 18 grams each for the other two. This results in a total weight of approximately 61 grams for the three strawberries combined. Since the container weight is excluded, and all strawberries are visible with no pieces missing, this estimation is focused solely on the fruit. The size comparison with the bowl and the visible berry surfaces supports this estimation range."
ppf8hc,poivrons jaune,150.0,70.0,80.0,1.2764599510690353,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/95e84def-c82b-4360-8390-f5153ff61064,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is the 'poivrons jaune' (yellow peppers). In the image, the yellow pepper is partially whole with some pieces cut off and placed on the plate. Visually, there is about one small bell pepper's worth of yellow pepper, including the hollowed-out half filled with quinoa and bulgur, and two separate slices on the plate. The size of the pepper is comparable with the fork in the background, which suggests a small to medium pepper typical in Swiss servings. Considering the roasting and cooking, the pepper has shrunk slightly but remains dense. A small to medium bell pepper typically weighs between 100 and 150 grams raw, but after cooking and some parts removed (seeds and core), the edible portion here is less. Since the pepper is hollowed out and roasted, with two slices visible plus the main body, I estimate the total weight of the yellow pepper flesh to be around 60-80 grams. Taking a moderate position within this range and considering some visible moisture loss during cooking, I estimate approximately 70 grams of yellow pepper flesh on the plate."

The image shows one slice of fondant au chocolat maison on a plate. Step 1: Visual Identification - the slice is a single piece of cake, notably thick at the back and tapering to the front tip, with a cracked top typical of a fondant. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - comparing with the plate size and the mug handle in the background, the slice is about 12 cm long, 6 cm wide at the widest part, and appears to be approximately 3.5 to 4 cm thick. Step 3: Density Considerations - fondant au chocolat is dense and moist, heavier than a typical sponge cake, so density is quite high. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - given the thickness and dense texture, such a slice in Swiss portion context is medium size. Step 5: Cross-validation - Considering comparable chocolate cake slices generally range between 110-160g, and the dense nature of fondant makes it heavier per volume, this slice likely weighs on the higher end but is not oversized. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - No other foods to compare with, but the piece corresponds to moderate dessert serving size. I estimate the weight of this fondant au chocolat maison slice to be approximately 150 grams."
ppf8hc,pâtes carbonara,236.0,170.0,66.0,1.6568450164876076,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/4d4e6539-b86f-4019-b2aa-0c15dbce0667,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'pâtes carbonara' visible on a white plate. The dish includes penne pasta with cream sauce and small pieces of bacon or pancetta. On top, there is a visible pile of grated gruyère cheese although the estimation must focus only on the 'pâtes carbonara', meaning the pasta with sauce and bacon, excluding the cheese. Step 1: The pasta appear to be a moderate portion, roughly spread in a 15-18 cm diameter area in the center of the plate. Step 2: Considering the thickness of the pasta layer and the presence of sauce, which adds moisture and density, the volume seems to be about 1 to 1.5 cm thick on average over the area. Step 3: The pasta is cooked and mixed with sauce and bacon, making it relatively dense. Typical cooked pasta portions in Switzerland tend to be smaller than US portions, so this looks like a medium portion. Step 4: Estimating based on visual size against the plate, the pasta component weighs approximately between 150 and 190 grams. Since the pasta fills a moderate part of the plate with sauce and bits of bacon, a reasonable middle ground estimate is about 170 grams. Step 5: The cheese on top is excluded from the estimate as per instructions. Step 6: Checking if this weight is logical in relation to a typical Swiss meal portion; given the pasta amount on the plate, 170 grams of cooked pasta carbonara is consistent and realistic. Final estimate: 170 grams for the 'pâtes carbonara' portion on the plate."

The image shows four pieces of sweet potato waffle ('gaufre à la patate douce') on a medium-sized plate. Each piece is roughly quarter of a small waffle, about 8 cm x 6 cm in size and approximately 1.5 cm thick. Sweet potato waffles tend to be denser than typical waffles due to the sweet potato content. A full small sweet potato waffle would typically weigh around 140-160 grams. Considering that the four pieces together correspond to the entire waffle, I estimate the total weight is around 150 grams. The sauce, smoked salmon, and other ingredients are not included in this estimate as per instructions, only the waffle is considered."

The target food item is 'purée de pdt' (mashed potatoes). Visually, the mashed potatoes form a mound on the plate, under the ragoût meat and carrots, partially covered by sauce. The plate is a standard size, roughly 24 cm in diameter, providing a scale reference. The mashed potatoes are about 12 cm long and 7-8 cm wide, with an estimated depth of about 2 cm given the slight mound shape. Mashed potatoes have a moderate density, denser than fluffier foods but lighter than solid meat. Considering the portion is roughly a rectangle around 12x8x2 cm, this results in approximately 192 cm³ volume. Given the density of mashed potatoes is about 0.8 g/cm³, the estimated weight is around 150 grams. This looks like a medium portion, neither very small nor very large, so 150 grams is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the purée de pdt to be approximately 150 grams."

The image shows a bowl containing sliced kiwi pieces arranged over a white creamy base identified as 'séré maigre'. The target food item is the kiwi. Visually, there are approximately 20 individual kiwi pieces. Each piece looks to be about a medium-small slice from the kiwi fruit, roughly 1.5-2 cm in length and 1 cm in thickness. Considering the typical density of kiwi (about 0.9 g/cm3) and the size of these pieces, each piece likely weighs around 8-10 grams. Multiplying by 20 slices yields a range of 160 to 200 grams total. The bowl size and thickness of kiwi pieces also support this estimation as the pieces form a substantial layer, covering nearly half the bowl surface and piled up moderately. Given it is a Swiss portion (generally smaller sizes), a conservative estimate around the middle of this range is appropriate. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the kiwi to be approximately 180 grams."

The target food items are 'salade de pâtes, cornichon, fromage, tomate'. On the plate, the salade de pâtes (pasta salad) is visible as a small mound of elbow macaroni mixed with small pieces of cornichon (pickle) and possibly bits of cheese. The salad is roughly 7 cm wide and 3-4 cm high, with a compact appearance, indicating a dense cooked pasta salad. Cooked pasta salads are dense and fairly heavy per volume. The cornichon pieces mixed within are small but add to the mass slightly. The fromage (cheese) pieces appear embedded within the pasta salad and are not visible separately as cubes or slices, so their weight is part of the salad. The tomate is a single small cherry tomato on a skewer, visually about 2.5-3 cm in diameter and standard density. One small cherry tomato typically weighs around 15-20 grams. Overall, the pasta salad portion seems medium-sized and dense, with an estimated weight between 100 to 130 grams considering Swiss portion sizes. The single cornichon slices visible inside the salad are included in this estimate. The cherry tomato weighs about 18 grams, and since it's served separately on the skewer, it should be considered independently and not included in the salade de pâtes estimate. Since the target is salade de pâtes, cornichon, fromage, tomate together, and the cornichon and fromage are incorporated into the pasta salad, their weight is included in the estimate for the salad. The cherry tomato is a single piece weighing about 18 grams. Therefore, combining pasta salad including cornichon and cheese (~120 grams) plus one cherry tomato (~18 grams), the total estimate is about 138 grams. To remain conservative and account for any small overestimation, I opt for 135 grams total for all these items combined."

The image shows a white bowl partially filled with milk and cereal pieces. The cereal consists mostly of small flakes and some small chunks, likely granola-type or muesli with a few chocolate bits. The bowl size appears medium, comparable to a typical breakfast bowl, with a diameter around 15-18 cm judging by the size of the spoon and pen visible in the background. The cereal covers the bottom of the bowl with a thin to moderate layer, estimated depth of about 0.5-1 cm. Considering density, the granola/muesli flakes have moderate density, heavier than pure flakes but lighter than dense nuts. The visual portion corresponds to roughly half a standard serving, which in Swiss portions is about 30-40g per full serving. Given the moderate coverage and density, the cereal weight is estimated around 25 grams."

The target food item is 'perle de blé'. In the image, the perle de blé is the small round wheat pearls that are visible mixed with the yellow sauce and shrimp at the bottom left of the bowl. The bowl itself is a medium-sized container, and the pearl wheat portion takes up roughly one quarter of the bowl's volume, mixed with sauce and shrimp. The pearls are cooked and look dense but slightly loose. Given that cooked pearl wheat typically weighs around 130-160 grams per cup, and estimating the volume here as about 100-120 ml (given the bowl size and the visible amount), the dry weight would be less, but we estimate the cooked weight. Considering the visible density, distribution, and typical Swiss portion sizes (which are smaller), I estimate the perle de blé portion to be medium-sized, around 90 grams. This avoids overestimation due to sauce mixing and partial coverage by the beans."

The image shows a glass bowl filled with chocolate yogurt. The yogurt appears smooth and slightly thick, with a mix of dark and light chocolate visible. The bowl is small to medium sized and can be compared to the texture and typical serving size of yogurt. Usually, a standard serving of yogurt in a bowl like this would range between 100 to 150 grams. The volume filled in the bowl is moderate but not full to the brim, so a reasonable estimation would be at the middle of this range. Considering the density of yogurt is close to that of water (near 1 gram per ml), the weight should closely correspond to its volume. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the chocolate yogurt in the bowl to be approximately 130 grams."

The target food item is 'sauce'. Visually, the sauce covers the bottom of the plate and is spread thinly under and around the mashed potatoes, meat ragout, and carrots. The plate diameter is roughly 25-28 cm, and the sauce layer is shallow, estimated to be about 2-3 mm thick where it is thickest. The sauce is mostly clear brown liquid with some small visible bits, indicating a slightly dense gravy but mostly liquid. Given this thin spread and accounting for the relatively small depth, the volume of sauce is moderate but not large. Using a rough calculation: a 20 cm diameter area covered by 0.25 cm depth gives about 78.5 cm² * 0.25 cm = 19.6 cm³ of sauce approximately, which is close to 20 grams since sauce density is near water. The sauce also penetrates some of the mashed potatoes and meat, but this does not significantly add volume visible on the plate. Considering Swiss portion sizes tend to be moderate, I estimate the sauce weight to be around 20 grams, which fits a typical serving of gravy accompanying this meal size."

The salade de céleri is located at the bottom right of the plate and is presented as a heap of finely shredded celery root. The portion size looks moderate, about the size of a small fist. Comparing it to the potato salad portion on the bottom left and the carved pieces of roasted chicken on the top left, the celery salad appears less dense but volumetrically about half the size of the potatoes. Celery root salads typically have some dressing that adds slight weight but the density remains relatively low due to fibrous vegetable content. The estimated volume corresponds roughly to about 80-100 grams. Given Swiss portion sizes tend to be modest, I lean towards the medium lower portion of this range, estimating the weight of the salade de céleri at approximately 85 grams."

The image shows a bowl with two distinct portions: white rice on the left and dahl de lentilles corail with carrots and tomato sauce on the right. Focusing on the riz (rice), it appears to occupy about half of the bowl's interior volume. The bowl is medium-sized, roughly 15 cm in diameter, with a depth sufficient to hold a substantial portion. The rice is cooked and fluffy, suggesting typical cooked rice density of about 130-150 g per cooked cup (approx. 200-240 ml volume). Visually, the rice portion seems about 1 cup or slightly less, given it fills half the bowl and is slightly compressed by the dahl. Considering typical Swiss smaller portion sizes, I estimate the rice portion to be on the medium side, around 140-160 g. This accounts for the compactness and clear volumetric space shown. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the riz portion to be approximately 150 grams."

The image shows one whole pear ('poire') held in a hand, providing a clear size reference. The pear is medium-sized compared to the fingers, with a typical pear shape that tapers from a wider base to a narrower top. Given the usual density of pears, which are primarily water and relatively dense fruit, and considering this is a Swiss portion size likely smaller than large US pears, the weight can be estimated by comparing it to average known weights. A medium pear typically weighs between 150 and 180 grams. The visible size here suggests the pear is not small but also not overly large—more towards a standard medium size. Taking the careful visual cues and the density into account, the estimated weight for this pear is approximately 165 grams."

The image shows a plate divided into four sections: salad leaves (salade), broccoli florets, corn kernels (mais), and chickpeas (pois chiches). The target food item is 'mais' (corn). Visually, the corn occupies a small pile on the plate, next to a larger pile of chickpeas and broccoli florets. The pile of corn looks about 3 cm by 3 cm in area with some depth, roughly 1-1.5 cm thickness. Comparing to the size of the plate (a standard dinner plate approximately 25 cm in diameter) and broccoli pieces, the corn portion is small but compact. Corn kernels are dense but small individually; a small handful typically weighs about 80-100 grams. Here, the corn pile is visibly less than a handful, about 1/3 to 1/4 of a handful volume. Given these dimensions and density, the corn portion likely weighs between 20 and 30 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes tend smaller, and the portion looks moderately filled but not piled high, a medium-low estimate around 25 grams is reasonable."

The target food is 'boulgour', located in the bottom left section of the container. Visually, the bulgur fills about one quarter of the container's volume, appearing as small grains that are fluffy but compact. The container is a medium-sized glass dish roughly 15x15 cm with a depth visible from the sides around 4-5 cm. The bulgur layer depth looks about 2-3 cm thick. Bulgur is a dense cooked grain, so it is heavier than it looks per volume. A typical medium portion of cooked bulgur in Swiss portions is around 120-150 grams. Given the visual volume and compactness, the bulgur here likely weighs just under that, but not too small. Estimating a moderate portion size in the 130-140 grams range seems most consistent. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the bulgur to be approximately 135 grams."

The image shows a small blue bowl containing a creamy, smooth caramel custard (crème caramel). The portion appears to be spread thinly at the bottom of the bowl without filling the container deeply. Considering the bowl size relative to the person's fingers and leg (visible as a reference for scale), the volume of custard is modest—roughly about 70-90 ml in volume. Crème caramel has a density similar to a dairy cream dessert, close to 1 g/ml. Therefore, the weight should approximate the volume in grams. Given the spread and depth, the portion is a small-to-medium serving typical in Swiss context, closer to 80 grams. There are no large extra pieces or additions to increase mass, and the custard's light, smooth texture also confirms density consistency. Thus, I estimate the weight of the crème caramel to be approximately 80 grams."

The image shows a white bowl partially filled with cereal and milk. The cereal consists mostly of crumbly granola-type clusters with a few small chunks of chocolate. The clusters are uneven in size but generally small to medium. The cereal pieces are floating mostly at the surface of the milk, indicating that the milk is filling a significant portion of the bowl and that the cereal is not deeply piled. The bowl is medium-sized, which I estimate to be about 15 cm in diameter based on visual comparisons to the spoon and the nearby items. The cereal appears to cover roughly a third to half of the milk's surface with some density. Granola cereals are dense but light when in clusters, and with the addition of chocolate chunks, the weight slightly increases. Accounting for the volume and typical density of such cereals, and considering Swiss portion sizes tend to be moderate, the total cereal weight is likely in the range of 25 to 40 grams. I judge this portion as medium size, so I select the middle of this range, estimating the total weight of the ""cereales"" to be approximately 32 grams."

The target food is 'cottage cheese aux herbes', located near the bottom center of the plate, slightly to the right of the hummous. It appears as a small pile of white cottage cheese curds mixed with herbs. The portion size is modest, consistent with a small Swiss serving typically around 100 grams or less. Comparing the portion visually to other items on the plate, such as the fried egg (which typically weighs about 60-70 grams) and the olives (which weigh about 5-7 grams each), the cottage cheese pile seems to have a volume roughly half to two-thirds of the egg. Considering the density of cottage cheese, which is not very dense but still compact, the estimated weight for this small portion is around 70 grams, a medium to small portion size appropriate for this meal context."

The compote pomme (apple sauce) is present on top but is not included in this estimate. Considering the visual size, typical density of waffles (cake-like but somewhat airy), and standard Swiss portion size which tends to be moderate, I estimate the weight of the waffle to be approximately 80 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing an apricot industrial yogurt with visible small chunks of apricot mixed inside. The bowl is positioned next to a laptop keyboard, which gives a familiar scale reference. Given the size of the bowl relative to the keyboard keys, the bowl appears to be a small dessert bowl roughly 12-14 cm in diameter. The yogurt fills slightly less than half the bowl, appearing as a compact, creamy mass with visible small apricot pieces distributed inside. Industrial yogurts of this type typically have a creamy density close to water, so 1 ml roughly equals 1 gram. Estimating the volume of yogurt is about 120-150 ml, based on the portion size shown and depth estimated from the curvature of the bowl. Considering the apricot pieces are mixed and contribute slightly to the weight but are a small fraction, the total weight estimate for the yogurt contents without the bowl is around 140 grams. This aligns with common portion sizes for single-serve fruit yogurts in Switzerland, which tend to be smaller than US portions. Therefore, based on visual evidence and portion size norms, I estimate the weight of the 'yogourt industriel à l'abricot avec morceaux' to be approximately 140 grams."

The image shows two slices of brown bread (pain) on a white plate. They appear to be medium thickness, standard slice sizes typical of Swiss portion bread. Comparing the bread thickness and slice size to the spoon in the top left corner of the image and the plate size, the slices are approximately 1.5 cm thick and roughly 10 cm long by 7 cm wide. Standard density for bread is about 0.25 g/cm³. Volume estimation for one slice is approximately 10 cm × 7 cm × 1.5 cm = 105 cm³. Multiplying volume by density gives 105 × 0.25 = 26.25 grams per slice. There are two slices present, so the total bread weight is about 52.5 grams. However, since the target food item is 'pain' and both slices represent the full portion, the estimate for total bread weight (pain) served is approximately 53 grams, rounding conservatively. No container weight or toppings included, only the bread."

The target food is ""yogourt orange sanguine"" which appears as a creamy mixture in a bowl combined with ""mélange de céréales"" and ""myrtilles"". The overall mixture looks like yogurt with cereal flakes and blueberries mixed in. Given that it is layered and mixed, I estimate the total volume by comparing the filled portion of the bowl to a standard small-to-medium cereal bowl, which usually holds about 300-350 grams of yogurt plus add-ins. The yogurt itself is mixed and dense but interspersed with cereal flakes and blueberries, so the actual yogurt volume is less than the full contents. Visually, the yogurt content appears to be roughly half to two-thirds of the bowl's mixture by volume. Considering depth and surface area coverage, I estimate the yogurt portion to be around 200 grams. This fits a typical Swiss-sized breakfast serving and accounts for the visibly integrated cereals and fruits. Cross-checking, the orange sanguine yogurt is visibly thick and creamy, consistent with this weight. Therefore, I estimate the ""yogourt orange sanguine"" portion to be approximately 200 grams."

The target food items are the four slices of cheese: manchego, two types of gruyère, and raclette. On the plate, there are four distinct slices of cheese, each with a thickness of roughly 3-5 mm and a size roughly comparable to a standard slice of cheese served as a small tasting portion, about 3-4 cm in length and 2-3 cm in width on average. The cheese slices are relatively dense food items, so their volume correlates with a higher weight than lighter foods. Comparing to the slice of bread to the right, which is about 40 grams for a small piece of multi-seed bread, the cheese slices collectively occupy about a third of the visual volume of the bread slice. Typically, a small cheese slice like these weighs around 15-20 grams. With four slices visible, I estimate each is about 15-18 grams on average, giving a total of approximately 63 grams of cheese. Given the density and compact nature of these cheeses, this is a reasonable estimate for the total cheese weight without container weight. Thus, the weight of the fromages (manchego, 2 sortes de gruyères, raclette) is about 63 grams."

The target food is 'betterave' (beetroot), which is located on the left side of the plate as diced dark red cubes. There are about 12 to 14 visible pieces, each roughly 2-3 cm in size. The cubes form a small pile of roughly 5 cm by 5 cm surface area and an estimated depth of about 1.5 to 2 cm, typical for diced cooked beetroot. Beetroot is dense and moist, so volume correlates well with weight. Compared to the surrounding foods, the beetroot portion is smaller than the quinoa pile but relatively dense. Considering Swiss portion sizes, this amount of beetroot is likely a small to medium portion. Using typical density and size, I estimate the total weight of the beetroot on the plate to be about 90 grams."

The image shows a standard white plate with three distinct portions: cooked spiral pasta on the left, a creamy white sauce (likely crème fraîche) in the middle, and a chili mixture on the right. The chili contains visible chunks of cervelas sausage mixed with kidney beans and sauce. The target food is 'cervelas'. STEP 1: Visual identification - there are roughly 12 to 15 visible chunks of cervelas distributed through the chili portion, ranging from about 2-3 cm cubes to smaller pieces, fairly uniformly mixed in with the beans and sauce. STEP 2: Dimension analysis - the chili portion covers about half the plate surface, and the cervelas pieces appear to constitute about 30-40% of the chili volume. The chili depth is roughly around 2-3 cm given the piled texture and visible thickness. STEP 3: Density considerations - cervelas is a dense processed meat sausage, so its density is relatively high compared to beans and sauce. This means the volume appears smaller relative to the actual weight. STEP 4: Portion size calibration - the total chili portion is medium-sized for a Swiss meal, estimated at about 250-300 grams total. Given cervelas pieces are about one-third of the chili volume, the cervelas weight should be around 30-40% of that, i.e., roughly 90-120 grams. STEP 5-6: Cross-validation and relative weight validation - the cervelas chunk size and count confirm this estimate, as the sausage pieces are dense and fairly large. Compared to the pasta portion (likely about 150 grams), the cervelas weight within the chili seems reasonable around 100 grams. Therefore, I estimate the cervelas weight in this dish to be about 105 grams."

The carrot appears straight, approximately 15-18 cm in length, and moderately thick with a diameter around 3.5-4 cm. Peeled carrots without skin weigh slightly less than unpeeled, but peeling does not significantly reduce weight. The density of a carrot is moderate, being a dense vegetable with some water content. A typical medium-sized peeled carrot weighs about 60-80 grams. Given the visual evidence and the carrot's size and thickness, it corresponds to a medium carrot closer to 70 grams.

The target food item is 'pâtes' (pasta). In the image, the pasta portion is clearly visible on a standard dinner plate. The plate diameter provides a size reference, typically around 24-26 cm. The pasta portion occupies about one-quarter of the plate's surface area and is moderately piled, with visible ribbon pasta (likely tagliatelle or fettuccine) appearing cooked and moist with mushroom sauce. The pasta strands are relatively wide but not densely packed, likely resulting in some air gaps. The depth of the pasta pile is roughly estimated at about 1.5-2 cm. Considering cooked pasta density (which is high due to water absorption), a portion covering about 1/4 of a 24 cm plate with a modest pile usually weighs between 100 to 130 grams. Given the Swiss portion context, these portions tend to be on the smaller side. Comparing the pasta visually to the courgettes gratinée portion which is smaller in volume but denser, the pasta appears about twice the volume of the courgettes, further supporting a weight around 110-120 grams. Therefore, after considering portion size, density, depth, and the visual comparison, the estimated weight for the 'pâtes' here is 115 grams."

The image shows two slices of toasted bread on a white plate. Each toast slice appears to be of standard size, approximately 10 cm x 10 cm and about 1-1.2 cm thick for toasted bread. Toast is less dense than fresh bread but similar in weight given similar size. A typical slice of Swiss-style toast bread weighs approximately 30-35 grams. Given these are standard-sized slices and given the visual thickness and crispiness, each slice likely weighs about 32 grams. There are two slices visible, but since the target food is 'toast' and the prompt does not specify to count both or just one, I assume the weight of one slice. Therefore, the estimate for one toast slice is 32 grams."
m4egh2,banane,77.0,55.0,22.0,0.18019359642591215,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/f218b781-84b2-41d2-b7fe-b01c9a162f8a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a peeled banana segment placed on a dark textured surface. The banana segment is approximately half the length of a typical banana, judging by the visible texture and curvature. Its thickness and diameter appear consistent with a medium-sized banana. A whole medium banana typically weighs about 120-130 grams including peel, and the edible portion is around 100-110 grams. Since this banana is peeled and about half the usual length, the weight should be roughly half of the edible portion of a full banana. Therefore, estimating conservatively for a Swiss portion size, I estimate the weight of this peeled banana portion to be around 50-60 grams, with 55 grams as a reasonable midpoint estimate."
wrah5h,haricots rouges,91.0,70.0,21.0,0.20327624720774387,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1550c506-8c95-461f-b658-8f427dc2a0af,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The plate contains three main food items: haricots rouges (red kidney beans), cooked green beans, and cooked fusilli pasta topped with mozzarella. The target food is the haricots rouges, located at the left side of the plate. Visually, the haricots rouges portion occupies about a quarter of the plate. They appear plump and glossy, indicating cooked beans, which are dense. Counting individual beans roughly results in about 35-40 pieces. Each cooked kidney bean weighs approximately 1.5-2 grams on average. Multiplying by 40 beans gives a weight range of about 60-80 grams. Given this is a single moderate-looking portion on a standard-sized plate (about 22-24 cm diameter) which is typical in Swiss meals (smaller portions generally than US servings), I consider 70 grams a reasonable estimate for the portion of haricots rouges present."
xjvrtk,thon,100.0,80.0,20.0,0.21274332517817254,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/611431d0-f119-4ef8-ad73-bb27c5075c3c,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'thon' (tuna) visible in a glass container mixed with couscous, cucumber pieces, and some seeds. Step 1, visual identification: The tuna is flaked and mixed throughout the dish, visible as small pinkish chunks spread evenly. Step 2, dimension analysis: The container is a square glass dish roughly the size of a small lunchbox, about 15 cm wide and 5-6 cm deep — a moderate portion size. The tuna is mixed, not in large chunks, but spread throughout. Tuna pieces constitute roughly 20-25% of the volume of the container contents, given the visible density of the couscous and cucumbers. Step 3, density considerations: Tuna is a dense protein; 1 cm3 roughly weighs about 1 gram. Step 4, portion size calibration: The total amount of food looks like approximately 300-350 grams total in the container. Estimating 25% volume is tuna leads to approximately 75-90 grams of tuna. Step 5, cross-validation: Other items (couscous, cucumber) take the rest of the volume and weight; this seems consistent. Step 6, relative weight validation: The tuna pieces are fewer and smaller than the couscous grains but dense and compact, confirming an approximate 75-90 gram range. Considering the visual evidence conservatively, I estimate the tuna weight to be around 80 grams."

The target food item is 'bout de gruyère,' which is a piece of cheese visible on the plate. Step 1: Visual Identification - The gruyère piece is a rectangular block, centrally placed on the plate. It is a single solid piece, fully visible, not mixed or layered with other foods. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The piece is roughly comparable in length to the two small croissants (each about 6-7 cm long) and slightly thinner. I estimate the gruyère to be about 12 cm long, about 2 cm wide, and approximately 1.5 cm thick, given its solid shape and visual depth compared to the croissants and bread pieces. Step 3: Density Considerations - Gruyère is a dense cheese with an approximate density around 1.1 g/cm³. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Multiplying estimated volume (12 × 2 × 1.5 = 36 cm³) by density (1.1 g/cm³) gives about 39.6 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - Compared to the salami slices and bread pieces, this weight is consistent, as the cheese is a substantial but moderate piece. Step 6: Systematic Bias Check - The piece is solid, not airy, so no underestimation of density; dimensions considered conservatively, so no overestimation. Therefore, a final estimate around 40 grams is reasonable."

The target food item is 'fromage' (cheese). In the image, the fromage is sliced into several thin rectangular strips placed on one half of a sandwich made with pain bis bread. There are about 7 cheese slices visible, each approximately 1.5 cm wide, 7-8 cm long, and about 2-3 mm thick. The slices appear to be semi-hard cheese, thus fairly dense. Comparing to the size of the bread slice (average slice weight ~40g) and relative thickness, the total volume of cheese can be approximated. Each slice likely weighs around 7-9 grams given their size and density. Multiplying by 7 slices, the total fromage weight is estimated to be between 50 and 65 grams. Given the moderate pile and typical Swiss portioning, a mid-range estimate of 57 grams is reasonable."

The target food item is ""fromage de brebis/chèvre (2 bouts)"", located on the bottom left part of the plate. There are two small pieces of cheese visible: one is a slightly rounder small wedge with a rind, and the other is a flat slice with a rough edge. Both pieces are relatively small compared to the other cheeses and the slice of bread on the plate. Considering the thickness and size relative to the bread slice (approximately 12-14 cm length bread slice), each cheese piece is roughly 2-3 cm in length and about 1-1.5 cm thick. Sheep and goat cheeses (brebis/chèvre) tend to be dense, so their weight is more than it appears by volume. Each small wedge piece probably ranges between 15 to 20 grams. Together, given the two pieces, the total weight is likely between 30 and 40 grams. By visual estimation, considering the pieces are on the smaller side but dense, a good estimated total weight for the two bouts of fromage de brebis/chèvre is approximately 35 grams."
8japfq,pain aux fruits,99.0,80.0,19.0,0.20008509733007127,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/63d7962e-f953-4987-96fb-2f843d8a12d1,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small piece of pain aux fruits being held between fingers, which gives a clear size reference. The piece is roughly rectangular and appears to be dense with visible fruit bits and nuts, suggesting some heaviness. Judging by the size relative to the thumb and index finger, the piece is about 6 cm long, 4 cm wide, and approximately 2-3 cm thick. Pain aux fruits is generally dense bread with dried fruits and nuts, which increases density compared to normal bread. With this compact size and density, a typical small Swiss portion of pain aux fruits of this size would weigh around 70-90 grams. Considering the visible compactness and volume, I estimate the weight at about 80 grams."

The target food item is 'mozarella'. Visually, the mozzarella appears as a single portion of fresh mozzarella cheese, somewhat flattened and spread slightly on the plate. The portion is about the size of a large egg, roughly 7-8 cm in diameter and 1.5-2 cm thick, typical for a standard fresh mozzarella ball. Compared to the olives and salad leaves on the plate, the mozzarella portion occupies a significant volume but is dense. Fresh mozzarella typically has a density around 1 g/cm3. Considering Swiss portion sizes, this seems to be a medium-sized single mozzarella ball, not an overly large or multiple balls combined. Based on these observations and typical weights for this amount of fresh mozzarella, I estimate the mozzarella weighs around 90 grams."

The image shows a plate divided roughly into three portions of food: boiled spiral pasta on the left, a portion of chili with visible cervelas pieces and red kidney beans on the right, and a small dollop of crème fraîche between the two. The target food, chili, consists of cooked cervelas sausage pieces, kidney beans, and chili sauce. Visually, the chili occupies about half of the plate's surface area on one side, piled in a somewhat thick layer with visible chunks. The plate appears to be a standard medium-sized plate (around 23 cm diameter), providing scale for volume estimation. Compared to the pasta portion of dense, cooked spirals, the chili is also dense, with solid sausage pieces adding to mass and volume. Considering a typical Swiss portion size (smaller than US), and the visible volume and density of the chili including the sausage and beans, the weight likely ranges between 180-230 grams. Taking a middle estimate in this range to remain conservative and consistent with visual evidence, a good estimation is about 210 grams for the chili portion without container weight. This accounts for depth and visible chunk volume, avoiding underestimation of the sausage pieces and bean density."

The image shows a piece of bread ('pain') with a spread of chestnut cream ('crème de marrons') on top. The target food is 'crème de marrons'. The piece of bread looks to be approximately 7-8 cm in length and around 3-4 cm wide with an average thickness of about 2 cm. The chestnut cream is spread moderately thick on the bread, approximately 3-4 mm in thickness, covering most of the surface. Given the cream's dense, sticky texture, which is heavier than jam or jelly spreads, the volume of crème de marrons is roughly 20-25 cubic centimeters. Considering chestnut cream density is about 1.3 g/cm³, this would correspond to around 26-33 grams. Being mindful of Swiss portion sizes and the moderate application of the cream, I estimate the weight of the chestnut cream here to be approximately 30 grams."

The target food to estimate is 'sauce curry avec mayonnaise,' which is visible as a yellow spread on the sandwich bread around the chicken and lettuce. The amount of sauce spread appears thin but covers a moderate surface area inside two baguette sandwiches. Given the typical density of curry sauce mixed with mayonnaise, which is creamy but not very dense, and the visual thickness of approximately 2-3 mm layer spread unevenly, the combined weight appears small. Each sandwich likely contains about 15-20 grams of sauce. Since there are two sandwiches, the total visible amount of 'sauce curry avec mayonnaise' is approximately 30-40 grams. Given no heavy pooling or additional containers and the sauce not being in large dollops, a conservative estimate is 35 grams total, assuming the sauce is not heavily concentrated in one sandwich only but spread similarly."

The image shows one whole artichaut (artichoke) placed on a medium-sized plate. Comparing the artichoke to the visible size of the hand holding the plate and the plate itself, the artichoke appears to be of a medium-small size common in Swiss portions. Artichokes typically have a dense structure with thick leaves and a solid heart, contributing to their weight. The artichoke occupies a relatively compact volume on the plate without any additional hidden parts. Considering that an average medium artichoke weighs approximately 120-150 grams, and given the relatively modest size in the image, I estimate this artichoke to be around 130 grams."

The image shows a small clear glass containing a portion of houmous au basilic, placed above a white plate with various vegetables, mozzarella, and an egg. The glass looks like a standard small dessert or espresso glass, approximately 6-7 cm tall and 5-6 cm in diameter. The houmous fills about half to two-thirds of the glass, which appears to be a relatively dense, thick paste typical of hummus. Given the spread and thickness, this portion is small to medium-sized, typical for a single serving of condiment or dip. Considering the density of hummus (roughly close to water in terms of weight per volume), and estimating the volume of the portion at about 40-50 ml, the weight would be close to 40-50 grams since 1 ml of hummus roughly equals 1 gram. Therefore, based on the visual evidence and portion size, I estimate the weight of the houmous au basilic to be approximately 45 grams."

The image shows a piece of pain complet with an even layer of yogourt nature spread on top. The slice of pain complet is about the size of a typical small bread slice, roughly 10 cm by 6 cm. The yogourt is spread fully on the slice, with moderate thickness, approximately 0.5 cm thick in some areas but averaging slightly less. Yogourt nature typically has a density close to water, about 1 g/cm3. Estimating the yogourt volume: the bread slice surface area is approximately 60 cm2, multiplied by an average thickness of around 0.4 cm gives about 24 cm3. This corresponds to approximately 24 grams of yogourt. Given the spread is fairly even and not overly thick, and considering Swiss portion sizes tend smaller, I estimate the yogourt nature weight to be about 24 grams."

The target food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries). In the image, they are located on the left side of the black bowl mixed with raspberries. I count about 11 visible blueberries, some partially hidden but not deeply piled. Blueberries are dense, with typical individual weight of approximately 1 to 1.3 grams each in small Swiss portions. Comparing them to the porridge and the hand holding the bowl, each blueberry is about 1.3 cm in diameter, consistent with average blueberries in Switzerland. Given the count and density, the total weight is likely between 11 and 14 grams. Considering the size and moderate portion in the bowl as medium-sized for Swiss portioning, I estimate approximately 13 grams for the blueberries."

The target food item is 'caviar d'aubergine' which is the lighter spread on the slice of seed bread at the top right of the plate. Step 1: Visually, there is one slice of bread with a moderate but even layer of caviar d'aubergine spread on it, covering most of the slice. Step 2: The slice of bread is a typical Swiss small rustic loaf slice, approximately 10 cm long and 5-6 cm wide. Given the spread thickness appears roughly 3-5 mm thick. Step 3: Eggplant caviar is relatively dense, with a texture similar to a thick dip/spread, slightly lighter than tapenade but still relatively dense due to olive oil and blended eggplant. Step 4: Estimating the volume: bread surface ~50 cm² and spread thickness ~0.4 cm yields about 20 cm³ volume of spread. Using a rough density of 0.9 g/cm³ for the caviar gives about 18 grams. Step 5: Considering this is a modest spread portion, and Swiss portions tend to be smaller, I estimate a reasonable portion size is 15-20 grams. Step 6: Comparing with the other spread (tapenade) which looks roughly similar in volume, and considering typical portion sizes, 18 grams is a fair estimate for the caviar d'aubergine on the slice."

The target food item is 'vinaigre,' which is a liquid dressing visible as a thin coating on the vegetables and seeds in the bowl. Visual identification shows that there is no separate container holding vinegar; rather, it is mixed on the salad components. Given that vinegar is a liquid and typically added sparingly in salads, it appears as a light dressing layer covering the vegetables and pumpkin seeds. The volume of vinegar can be roughly estimated by the shiny, moist surface appearance but there is no visible pooling indicating a large quantity. Common vinegar portion sizes for a salad of this size (medium bowl with cucumber, tomato, carrot, seeds, and sérac) range between 5 to 15 grams, considering Swiss portion contexts that favor smaller dressing amounts. Given the breadth of coverage without excess pooling, I estimate a medium portion inconsistent with heavy dressing, thus around 10 grams is a reasonable estimate."

The image shows a bowl divided roughly into two halves, one filled with white rice and the other with dalh de lentilles corail, a cooked lentil and vegetable stew. The bowl is medium-sized, similar to a standard cereal bowl, about 12-14 cm diameter. The dalh portion visibly occupies about half the bowl by volume, with a thickness comparable to the rice portion, showing a dense, compact consistency typical for cooked lentils. The dalh contains visible lentils, carrots, and onion pieces in a tomato-based sauce. Considering its density (lentils are dense, and the mixture is moist), and that the bowl is about medium size, the dalh likely weighs between 220 and 300 grams for such a filling. Given the portion appears neither minimal nor heaped excessively, I consider this a medium-large serving, closer to the upper end but not maximum. Cross-checking with the rice portion (also about half the bowl, but rice cooked volume is lighter), the dalh visually holds more mass. Therefore, my best estimate for the weight of the dalh de lentilles corail is 280 grams."

The image shows a single piece of dark chocolate ('chocolat noir') that appears to be part of a standard chocolate bar, but broken off from the rest. The piece has a typical thickness of about 1 cm, length around 4 cm, and width about 2.5 cm, based on visual comparison to typical items like plate texture and chocolate segment sizes. Dark chocolate is dense, and a standard full chocolate bar segment usually weighs between 10 to 15 grams. Given this piece is slightly smaller than a full segment because it is broken with a missing corner, I estimate it to be slightly less than a full segment, around 9 grams. This estimate accounts only for the chocolate piece without any packaging or other elements."

The target food item is 'tomate' in a metal container with various colorful foods. Step 1: Visual identification shows the tomatoes are in slices, situated on the left side of the container, partially underneath a few slices of avocado. There appear to be about 2 to 3 tomato slices visible. Step 2: Dimension analysis - each tomato slice is roughly 5-6 cm in diameter and about 0.5-1 cm thick. Tomatoes are somewhat dense with water content. Step 3: Density consideration - tomatoes have moderate density, roughly 0.9 g/cm3, similar to cucumbers or other watery vegetables. Step 4: Estimation of volume - approximately 2.5 to 3 slices, each about 6 cm diameter and 0.7 cm thick, approximating each slice to a cylinder: volume per slice = π * (3 cm)^2 * 0.7 cm ≈ 20 cm3. For 3 slices, total volume ≈ 60 cm3. Step 5: Weight estimation - 60 cm3 * 0.9 g/cm3 = 54 grams. Step 6: Portion size calibration - the portion seems medium-sized, so about 50-60 g is reasonable. Step 7: Cross-validation - compared to other items like quinoa and avocado, tomato portion looks slightly smaller in volume but significant, so the weight aligns. Therefore, the estimated weight of the visible tomato slices is about 55 grams."

The image shows a hand holding multiple pieces of cashew nuts (noix de cajou). I will first count the visible cashews: there are 18 nuts in total, varying slightly in size but mostly medium-sized. Each cashew nut typically weighs about 1.2 grams on average. Considering the average size and the 18 count, the total estimated weight is around 21-23 grams. The nuts appear dry and dense, consistent with unsalted raw cashews. Since the nuts fill the palm without being heaped, the portion corresponds to a small-to-medium serving typical in Switzerland. After considering density and nut size, I estimate the total weight of the cashew nuts to be approximately 22 grams."

The image shows a medium-sized metal bowl containing a mixture of natural muesli and natural yogurt. The natural yogurt is partially visible mostly under and mixed with the muesli. The muesli covers approximately 70-80% of the visible surface area and appears to be in a moderately thick layer, with some depth apparent due to piled clusters and oats roughly 1.5 to 2 cm deep on average. Considering muesli is a dry, loose, but somewhat dense cereal mixture, and using the bowl size as a reference (typical small bowl diameter about 15 cm), the muesli volume is about a cup or slightly less, which correlates with about 40-50 grams of dry muesli. The yogurt visible is thick and creamy, but the task is to estimate only the muesli weight without container or yogurt. Given the Swiss portion context and visual evidence, the muesli natural portion is medium-sized and not excessive. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the muesli natural portion here is approximately 45 grams."

Given its diameter of approximately 6-7 cm (typical lemon size), and the thinness of the slice, the slice is a small portion of a lemon. Considering lemon density and moisture content, a lemon slice of this size typically weighs around 7 to 10 grams. Given the slice here is moderately thick, I estimate its weight at about 9 grams."

The target food item is the 'yaourt nature' visible in the image. Step 1: Visual identification shows one standard-sized container of plain yogurt, open and filled nearly to the top. Step 2: Dimension analysis – comparing to the apple next to it, the yogurt container appears to be a typical individual portion from a Swiss context, approximately 100 to 125 ml in volume. This aligns with typical retail yogurt pots. Step 3: Density considerations – plain yogurt has a density close to 1 g/ml, so the weight in grams closely matches the volume in ml. Step 4: Portion size calibration – given it is a single individual serving and not a large container, the portion size is medium. Step 5: Cross-validation shows no other yogurt items confuse the estimate. Step 6: Relative weight validation comparing with the apple which likely weighs around 150-170 grams; the yogurt container looks slightly smaller in volume, consistent with the typical 125g container size. Combining these observations, the estimated weight for the 'yaourt nature' is about 125 grams, which is a standard single-serving yogurt portion weight."

The image shows a single chocolate chip cookie placed on a wooden surface. The cookie is approximately the size of a standard palm, around 8-9 cm in diameter, judging by the surface grain size and the typical size of chocolate chunks visible. The cookie appears moderately thick, around 1-1.5 cm, with dense chocolate chunks embedded. Considering cookie density usually ranges from 0.8 to 1.1 grams per cm³ and this cookie looks homemade with visible chunks, it is denser than a thin crispy cookie but less dense than a cake. This suggests a medium weight. A typical chocolate chip cookie of this size and thickness weighs between 40 to 60 grams. Given the visual volume and visible chocolate chunks, I estimate the cookie weight to be about 50 grams."

The image shows one single feuilleté sauce tomate (puff pastry with tomato sauce). Step 1: The item is fully visible and appears to be a small, individual puff pastry roll with tomato sauce filling. Step 2: Dimension analysis shows that the puff pastry is roughly the size of a small pastry bite, approximately 4-5 cm wide, about 3-4 cm deep, and around 2-3 cm in thickness based on the visible layers and typical puff pastry structure. The surface visible and overall volume are small, consistent with a snack-sized portion. Step 3: Considering density, puff pastry is light but layered with some fat, and tomato sauce adds minimal weight. Therefore, the overall density is moderate but the volume is small. Step 4: Swiss portion sizes are generally smaller; this appears to be a single small piece. Typical small puff pastry hors d'oeuvres range from 20-40 grams. Step 5: There are no other items to compare visually, so the weight estimation strictly relies on this single piece. Step 6: Avoid overestimation due to the delicate, airy texture of the pastry. Given the above, I estimate the weight to be towards the lower mid-range, about 28 grams for this individual piece, considering it only has a small amount of tomato sauce and is a single portion piece. This estimate excludes any container or plate weight as required."

The image shows a medium-sized clear glass bottle filled partially with shelled peanuts (cacahuètes). Visually, the peanuts fill roughly the bottom third of the bottle. Given the bottle's size, roughly equivalent to a small beverage bottle of about 200-250ml volume, and considering that peanuts are dense but small items, I estimate the volume occupied by peanuts to be about 70-80 ml. The density of peanuts is approximately 0.60-0.65 g/ml. Multiplying volume by density gives around 42-52 grams. The peanuts are packed moderately, with visible gaps, so I lean toward the lower middle of this range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of cacahuètes to be approximately 45 grams."

The image shows a small amount of green lettuce leaves scattered on a white plate. The salad appears to be mostly iceberg or leaf lettuce with some dressing or sauce lightly spread on the leaves. There is no visible bulk or layering; the leaves are thin, and the portion is small, about a handful or less. Given that lettuce is light in density and the total visible volume is quite limited, I estimate the weight to be low. Typically, a small serving of green salad leaves can weigh between 10 to 20 grams for a modest plate portion. Considering this is quite minimal and partly consumed or residual salad, the estimated weight is near the lower end of this range. The sauce weight is excluded as per instructions, and only visible actual leaves are counted. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'salade verte avec sauce' (just the salad leaves) is approximately 12 grams."

The target food item is mayonnaise, located on the left side of the plate as a small dollop of white creamy sauce. Step 1: The mayonnaise portion is a single serving dollop, not spread or mixed with other items. Step 2: Its volume is roughly equivalent to about 1.5 tablespoons, based on the comparison with the fork and other food items. Mayonnaise is dense but spreadable, so a small scoop like this weighs more than it appears. Step 3: Considering typical density for mayonnaise (around 0.95 g/ml) and estimating approximately 22-25 ml volume for the dollop, the weight would be near 21-24 grams. Step 4: Considering the Swiss portion context and visual cues, the amount looks like a typical small portion served alongside dishes, so I estimate around 22 grams. Step 5: Cross validating with the rest of the plate confirms the mayonnaise portion is smaller than the aubergines and the salad russe portions, consistent with this weight. Therefore, I estimate the mayonnaise on the plate to weigh approximately 22 grams."

The target food item is 'purée cacahuète' (peanut butter) visible on the left side of the plate as a small dollop. Compared to the other foods on the plate, especially the half banana and the chocolate chips, the peanut butter portion is relatively small. The peanut butter appears smooth and dense, with an estimated volume roughly the size of a heaping tablespoon, about 15 ml. Given that peanut butter density is close to 1.1 g/ml, this suggests a weight of approximately 16 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes are typically smaller, this estimate leans towards a small-to-medium portion. There is no visible excess beyond the surface dollop, and no container included in the weight. Therefore, the peanut butter portion is best estimated at about 16 grams."

The image shows a single croissant au chocolat held in a hand, which provides a good scale reference. The croissant is partially eaten, but still retains a substantial size consistent with a standard Swiss-sized pastry. Compared to the adult hand, the croissant is roughly 12-14 cm long and appears fluffy but dense with the typical layered texture and some visible chocolate filling at the bitten area. Considering Swiss baked good portioning tends to be smaller than US sizes, the overall bulk of the croissant is moderate. Typically, a standard fresh croissant au chocolat in Switzerland weighs around 70 to 90 grams, depending on size and filling. Given the visible size, bite taken, and density, I estimate this croissant au chocolat weighs about 75 grams."

The target food item is 'oignon' (onion). Upon examining the image, the onion is present as small chopped green pieces sprinkled on the slice of bread with ham. These green pieces are likely the green part of the onion, such as spring onion or scallion tops, rather than the white bulb. Visually, the quantity of onion on the bread is modest, roughly spread over the slice and limited in depth and volume. The green onion pieces seem to weigh very little as they are thin and sparse. Compared to other items on the plate (bread with ham, slices of salami, and two radishes), the onion has the smallest volume. Considering the density of onion (about 0.9 grams per cubic centimeter), and the visible quantity which is approximately a small handful or about 1-2 tablespoons chopped, a reasonable weight range for the onion on this plate is between 5 and 10 grams. Given the visual modesty and spread, a middle estimate of about 7 grams fits best."

The image shows a clear glass bottle labeled 'GINGER' which is a ginger tonic drink. The bottle is a typical small beverage bottle found in cafes or restaurants, about 20 cm tall and similar in size to a standard 200 ml glass bottle. Comparing it to the smartphone beside it and glass in the background confirms this size estimation. The bottle appears to be mostly full. Since the target food item is the 'tonic au gingembre' (ginger tonic), it is a liquid inside the bottle and we need to estimate the content weight excluding container. Given that tonic water density is close to water (about 1 g/ml), a 200 ml volume would approximately weigh 200 grams. Considering possible slight variations and some air at the top, a weight estimate of around 190-200 grams for the liquid content is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the tonic au gingembre liquid to be 195 grams."

The target food is 'graines de chia' (chia seeds), which are mixed throughout the bowl with other ingredients: blanc battu (whipped egg whites), flocons d'avoine (oat flakes), and miel (honey). The chia seeds are visible as many small black seeds spread evenly throughout the mixture. Given their tiny size, counting individual seeds is impossible, so I must estimate overall volume and relative density. The bowl is a medium-size white ceramic bowl, about 12-14 cm diameter, containing a substantial amount of mixed content but notably chia seeds form only a small portion in weight. Chia seeds are very dense compared to the light blanc battu but are present in moderate quantities as seen by the speckled pattern in the mixture. Usually, such a mixture contains around 1-2 tablespoons of chia seeds to get this speckling, corresponding to approximately 10-15 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes which tend to be smaller and the visible amount of seeds dispersed, I estimate the chia seeds weight at about 13 grams, balancing between the lower and middle range of typical portions for mixing in yoghurt-like bases. This is consistent with the visual coverage, density, and typical serving sizes for chia seeds in such a dish."

The target food item is 'boule de glace vanille' which is the vanilla ice cream scoop visible in the bowl. Step 1: Visual Identification - The image shows one single scoop of vanilla ice cream, partially covered with chocolate sauce. It is clearly separated from the compote de fraise rhubarbe by the color and texture. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The scoop appears to be a standard ice cream scoop size with a roughly spherical shape. Comparing it to the bowl, which is a small dessert bowl, the ice cream scoop diameter appears approximately 5-6 cm. This is typical for a single scoop serving in Swiss portions, which are slightly smaller than US sizes. Step 3: Density Considerations - Ice cream is dense but contains air; a typical density is about 0.55g/cm³ to 0.6g/cm³. Using an approximate volume for a 5.5 cm diameter sphere (V = 4/3 π r³, r=2.75cm), volume ~ 87 cm³. At 0.6 g/cm³, weight would be around 52 grams. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - This seems to be a standard single scoop, so the medium portion estimate at around 50 grams is reasonable. Step 5: Cross-validation - the chocolate sauce adds some weight but is excluded, and the compote is separate. Step 6: Relative Weight Validation - The ice cream seems smaller by volume than the compote portion but typical for one scoop. Given all this, a reasonable estimate for the boule de glace vanille is about 50 grams."

Comparing the size of the chocolates to the textured surface of the table and the placemat in the background, each chocolate figure is roughly 4-5 cm tall and about 3 cm wide, typical for small molded chocolates. Solid milk chocolate has a density around 1.3 grams per cubic centimeter. Estimating the volume of one chocolate bunny as approximately a small 3D shape akin to a small figurine, I approximate around 20-25 grams per piece. Since the question targets one chocolat (one piece), I estimate about 22 grams for one chocolate bunny, which fits the visual size and typical weight of similar molded chocolates."

The target food item is 'sauce oignons', the onion sauce visible on top of the slices of roast meat on the left side of the plate. In Step 1, the sauce is spread thinly over two slices of roast beef but is not overflowing. In Step 2, comparing to the roast meat slices and the plate, the quantity of sauce seems light, approximately covering an area of about 8 cm by 4 cm with a thin layer about 0.3 cm thick, which suggests low volume. Step 3 considers density—the sauce is mostly onions cooked down and likely combined with some liquid; its density is moderate but less than dense meats. Step 4 contextualizes portion size as modest, typical of a Swiss small-to-medium portion. Step 5 cross-validates against other foods: the sauce volume is clearly less than any salad or the meat itself. Step 6 relative weight: the sauce is around 1/10th the weight of the roast portion, which itself probably weighs around 120 grams. Taking into account all observations, I estimate the sauce oignons weight to be circa 25 grams."

The target food is 'brochette de boeuf' which is the beef skewer visible at the top center of the plate. Step 1: Visual Identification - There are three large beef cubes threaded on a wooden skewer. The skewer length is roughly equal to the width of the piece of bread, which appears to be a standard small baguette slice (~8-10 cm). Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each beef cube looks approximately 3 cm x 3 cm x 2.5 cm thick. Assuming slightly irregular shapes but fairly dense, total beef volume is about 3 pieces x ~22-25 cm3 per cube, total ~70 cm3. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cooked beef density is about 1.03 g/cm3, fairly dense and compact. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - This is a medium to small portion by Swiss standards, with three pieces. Calculating weight: volume (~70 cm3) x density (1.03 g/cm3) ≈ 72 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - Comparing to other items, the brochette appears slightly heavier than the merguez sausage (~60g), which seems reasonable. Step 6: Systematic Bias Check - The beef chunks are uniformly cooked and thick, and considering only the meat, no bone or skewer weight, 72 grams is a reasonable and conservative estimate."

The target food item is ""oeuf"" (egg). In the image, a single half of a hard-boiled egg is visible near the top right of the plate. Since it is only half the egg, we need to estimate the weight of this half. A standard medium hard-boiled egg typically weighs around 50 grams whole. Therefore, half the egg would be approximately 25 grams. Considering the egg is fully cooked and peeled with no shell, and the yolk is partially visible which adds to the density, 25 grams is a reasonable estimate. There are no additional pieces of egg visible, so this estimate applies to the single half shown. The size compares well to the surrounding food pieces and plate size. Hence, the estimated weight for the egg portion shown is 25 grams."

The target food is a single slice of toast ('tartine') with visible spread of chestnut cream ('crème de marrons') and butter. Step 1, visual identification: The slice is alone on a plate with some crumbs around, indicating it is a standard-sized slice of toasted bread. The spread covers most of the slice's surface but not thickly piled. Step 2, dimension analysis: The plate is a standard white ceramic plate, about 25 cm in diameter. The slice is roughly 10 cm long and 5-6 cm wide with moderate thickness of toasted bread, estimated about 1.5 cm thick. Step 3, density considerations: Toasted bread density is about 0.3-0.4 g/cm³; the chestnut cream is denser, similar to a thick jam (about 1.3 g/cm³); the butter spread is light but dense (about 0.9 g/cm³). Step 4, portion size calibration: The toast slice itself likely weighs around 30 grams given its size and toasted density. The spread seems thinly applied; around half a tablespoon (about 8 grams) of chestnut cream and roughly 5 grams of butter. Step 5, cross-validation: The total weight estimated by adding bread (30g), chestnut cream (8g), and butter (5g) gives about 43 grams. Since the crust and crumbs are visible and the spread is moderate, this estimate aligns well with the visible volume and density. Therefore, I estimate the combined weight of the tartine with chestnut cream and butter to be approximately 43 grams."

In the image, the seeds are mixed in with couscous, cucumber pieces, and tuna inside a rectangular glass container approximately the size of a standard lunchbox (roughly 15 cm wide). The pumpkin seeds appear to be embedded throughout the visible volume, but they are relatively sparse and small in mass compared to the other ingredients. Visual estimation counting the volume fraction, the seeds likely make up about 5-7% of the total visible volume. Given the container seems to hold around 300-350 grams of the entire mixture (typical for homemade couscous salad in this size container), the pumpkin seeds will be a small fraction of that. Pumpkin seeds are fairly dense and heavy for their small size, but the total visible amount appears to be around a small handful, roughly 15-20 grams. Considering Swiss portion context which tends smaller, and the even distribution without heavy clustering, I estimate the weight of the pumpkin seeds in this mix to be approximately 18 grams."

Using the size of the bowl as a reference (a small to medium salad bowl likely around 12cm diameter) and comparing the volume coverage and thickness of the vinaigre balsamique drizzle, the total volume of vinaigre balsamique is quite small. Balsamic vinegar has a density close to water (~1g/ml). Estimating from the spread and concentration, the vinaigre balsamique weighs approximately between 8 to 12 grams.

Visually, the egg is about the size of a typical medium hen egg, roughly 5-6 cm in diameter. Comparing it to the cherry tomatoes nearby, which are about 2-3 cm each, confirms this size estimate. The thickness of the fried egg white looks typical, about 3-5 mm. A medium cooked fried egg without container has an average weight of about 45-50 grams considering some moisture loss during cooking. Given this is a typical medium egg with no visible additions or modifications (no extra oil or batter coating visible), I estimate the weight on the conservative side around 48 grams.

The slice size appears to be a typical Swiss portion, smaller than larger USDA bread slices but similar in thickness and width, about the size of a hand palm. Based on visual cues, the slice is roughly 12 cm long and 8 cm wide, with a thickness of about 1.5 cm. Brown bread density is moderate, roughly 0.3-0.4 g/cm³ due to air pockets. Estimating volume as length × width × thickness gives about 144 cm³ (12 × 8 × 1.5). Multiplying by density around 0.33 g/cm³ results in approximately 48 grams. Considering this is a medium-sized portion and accounting for slight spreading/density variation, the bread weight is estimated around 45-50 grams. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'pain' slice to be 48 grams."

The image shows an open sandwich with two slices of pain bis (brown bread), with one slice spread with mayonnaise. The mayonnaise layer covers the bread thinly but evenly. Considering the size of the bread slice is typical for Swiss bread (approximately 10-12 cm in length) and the mayonnaise spread is thin, the volume of mayonnaise seems moderate. A thin to medium spread of mayonnaise on bread usually weighs about 10-15 grams. Given this spread covers the whole slice but not thickly, I estimate the mayonnaise weight to be around 12 grams. This is consistent with usual Swiss portion sizes favoring moderate spread thickness."
m4egh2,sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon),98.0,100.0,2.0,0.02084884586746091,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/6b91ac4b-1f0f-4176-bf40-a12a6cd892e2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon)' which visually appears as creamy mushroom sauce integrated with visible mushroom pieces on top of pasta. The mushrooms are medium-sized sliced pieces, about 8-10 visible pieces, thickly coated in cream sauce. The sauce covers roughly 1/3 of the bowl base and clings to the mushrooms and pasta, suggesting a moderate portion volume. Given the creamy texture and the presence of dense mushroom pieces, the density is moderate to high. Assuming the bowl is a small to medium serving bowl (about 15cm diameter), and considering Swiss portion size which tends to be smaller, the sauce volume would roughly be about 100-120 ml. Cream sauces with mushrooms typically weigh between 0.9 to 1.1 g/ml depending on cream thickness and mushroom chunk density. Estimating at 1 g/ml for simplicity and considering some displacement by mushrooms, the sauce mixture weight would range around 90-110 grams. Choosing a middle conservative estimate with slight reduction for air and cream density variability, I estimate the 'sauce aux champignons' weight to be approximately 100 grams."

The target food is 'tomates'. In the image, the tomates are cut into irregular chunks mixed with cucumber pieces on a small plate. Visually, there are about 8 visible chunks of tomato, each about 2-3 cm in dimension, with some depth. Tomatoes are dense, juicy, and moderately heavy. The tomatoes occupy roughly one-third of the total volume of the visible salad. Considering the plate size, which is likely a standard small plate of around 20 cm diameter, the total quantity of tomatoes corresponds to a small side portion. Typical weight for a medium tomato is about 100-150 grams whole, and the portion shown looks like roughly one-third to half of a medium tomato. Therefore, estimating based on visual size and volume, the weight of the tomatoes on this plate is approximately 50 grams."

The avocado slice is located near the center bottom of the plate. It is a single moderately thick wedge of avocado, showing a green outer side and yellowish flesh inside. Compared to the adjacent carrot pile and bread piece, the avocado slice is roughly 8-10 cm long and about 3 cm thick at its thickest point. Avocado is a relatively dense fruit with peel removed. A typical whole avocado weighs about 150-200 grams, and this slice appears to be approximately one-fifth to one-sixth of a whole avocado. Therefore, the avocado slice likely weighs between 25-35 grams. Given its visible size and typical density, I estimate the avocado slice weighs about 30 grams."

The image shows scrambled cooked egg ('oeuf') placed on a small square plate alongside diced tomatoes, avocado pieces, and two folded wraps. For the egg, it appears as a small, loosely piled quantity occupying roughly a 5x4 cm area with light height—typical for scrambled eggs. Considering the density of cooked egg and the visible amount, it looks like roughly the equivalent of one small egg portion. A cooked egg usually weighs about 50 grams, but here the portion is slightly smaller than a full egg, likely around 35-40 grams based on volume compared to a standard egg. The irregular shape and fluffy texture might reduce density somewhat, but given it's a cooked egg and fairly compact, the estimate stands at approximately 38 grams."

The image shows a single galette wrap with visible slices of avocado ('avocat') placed near the top part of the wrap. There appear to be about 3 slices of avocado, each approximately 5-6 cm long and moderately thick, typical of a standard avocado half portion. The avocado slices cover roughly one-third of the wrap's surface and have a visible depth indicating a fresh slice. Avocado is dense but also has some water content, so the density is moderate. In a Swiss portion size context, where serving sizes are smaller than in the US, a typical avocado slice portion of this size on the wrap likely weighs between 30 and 45 grams. Given the visible quantity and thickness, I estimate the avocado weight to be around 40 grams."
wrah5h,galette wraps,65.0,65.0,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/19a2e7b0-7aad-44c5-b52a-d67294d4ef49,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The galette wrap is fully visible on a standard-sized plate, which provides a good reference for its dimensions. The wrap appears to be a typical whole wheat galette, roughly 20-22 cm in diameter. Galette wraps from Swiss portions are generally thinner and smaller than US tortillas. The thickness is very thin, as usual for galette wraps. Based on standard nutritional data and visual comparison to the size of the utensils and plate, a single galette wrap of this size and type commonly weighs between 55 and 70 grams. Considering the visible size and thickness here, and that the wrap looks fresh and not overly dry or thick, I opt for a medium portion estimation near the middle of this range. Thus, the weight estimate is about 65 grams."

The image shows a single yogurt container labeled 'yogourt figue sans sucre' which is a fig-flavored unsweetened yogurt in a typical small Swiss-sized plastic cup. The container size compared to the nearby fork and table surface suggests a standard individual serving. Such yogurts usually come in portions between 125g to 150g in Switzerland. The visible portion is nearly full, and the container is typical for single servings in the range mentioned. Given that no additional food is mixed or layered and the product density is typical for yogurt (dense and compact), I estimate the weight of the yogurt alone to be about 150 grams, which aligns with typical commercial packaging for this type of product."
