r3bub9,risotto aux asperges,305.0,85.0,220.0,2.911820864433258,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/r3bub9/dish_media/207070c9-c6dd-4cf9-b0a7-5979b06babc3,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small portion of risotto aux asperges spread on a medium-sized rectangular plate. The risotto grains are creamy and a bit clumped together with visible pieces of asparagus. The portion is modest and does not fill the plate. Considering the plate size and typical volume per gram of cooked risotto, this portion looks to be rather small, likely less than a standard main dish portion (which is around 180-250g for pasta/rice dishes in Switzerland). Given the volume and density, I estimate the weight range to be about 70-100 grams. Assuming it's closer to a small side portion rather than a full meal serving, I choose a value near the mid-point, at 85 grams. This estimate accounts for the visible amount and density of the risotto on the plate, without overestimating the spread and thickness."
p96w4a,délice tomate mozzarella,54.0,270.0,216.0,0.5061621246311404,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/5ebafbd6-315d-44a6-8508-ba143d23adb2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The 'délice tomate mozzarella' is visually identified on the left side of the plate as alternating slices of fresh tomato and mozzarella cheese arranged neatly. The slices of tomato appear to be medium-sized, and there are roughly 6 tomato slices and 6 mozzarella slices stacked. Each tomato slice likely weighs around 15-20 grams given their size and thickness, while each mozzarella slice is denser and slightly heavier, around 25-30 grams each. Combining all slices, the tomato component would weigh approximately 100-120 grams and the mozzarella around 150-180 grams, totaling roughly 250-300 grams for the entire 'délice tomate mozzarella'. Considering some small overlaps and dressing (balsamic vinegar and herbs) which do not add weight, the overall portion is medium to large. The Swiss reference for a fruit/vegetable plus cheese dish does not apply exactly but the visual volume and density justify this weight. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'délice tomate mozzarella' to be approximately 270 grams."
xjvrtk,ananas,200.0,400.0,200.0,1.7358097552508245,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/b41068f9-5a0e-4c11-bf1b-7389d3917889,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows several pieces of fresh pineapple ('ananas') cut into medium-sized chunks arranged on a plate. The pieces are relatively thick and look juicy, with a visible firm texture typical of pineapple. Considering the size of each chunk and counting roughly 12 pieces, and knowing that an average chunk of pineapple weighs about 30-40 grams depending on thickness, the total pile likely weighs around 360-480 grams. The plate size and spacing support the interpretation of a moderately large portion, but not an entire pineapple. Based on this, I estimate the total weight of the pineapple pieces to be about 400 grams, which falls comfortably within the plausible range."
xjvrtk,tonic au gingembre,200.0,20.0,180.0,1.5622287797257421,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/c70f93c3-23cc-4817-bbe9-93091771b273,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small glass bottle labeled 'GINGER' which corresponds to the ginger tonic. The bottle is almost empty with just a small amount of liquid left visible at the bottom. Such glass bottles for tonic or ginger beer typically hold around 200-250 ml when full, which roughly converts to 200-250 grams given the density close to water. Given the bottle is nearly empty, I estimate the remaining liquid is about 1/10th of the bottle volume. This corresponds to roughly 20-25 grams of tonic left in the bottle. Since the prompt asked for the weight of the 'tonic au gingembre' as seen, this amount is approximately 20 grams."
xjvrtk,"légumes cuits: côtes de bette, betterave rouge, fenouil, carottes",336.0,160.0,176.0,2.566221142162819,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/bdb98a92-fcc8-4f1c-9acb-da9162427c7b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is the cooked vegetables: côtes de bette (chard stalks), red beetroot, fennel, and carrots. These are visually grouped on the left side of the plate. The portion occupies roughly one third of the plate and appears to be a mixed sauté or stew of these vegetables, chopped into bite-sized pieces. The vegetables are cooked and appear moist but not heavily sauced, and there is visible natural juice from the beetroot that slightly colors the plate. Considering the plate size (standard dinner plate about 25 cm diameter) and the volume of the vegetables, the portion is a moderate side dish. Swiss portion guidelines for cooked vegetables as a side range from 120-180g. Given the clustered pile and mix of dense vegetables like beetroot and chard stalks, this looks closer to a medium portion, but not particularly heaped. The portion does not cover the entire plate and is roughly estimated to have moderate thickness and volume. Taking into account the visible volume, density, and presence of denser roots like beetroot and carrots, I estimate the weight of the cooked vegetables mixture to be approximately 160 grams. This is within Swiss ranges, and plausible given the visible size and the comparison to a large slice of the omelette occupying the other half of the plate."
xjvrtk,tomates cerises,500.0,340.0,160.0,3.471619510501649,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/5ccbcf64-3631-48df-9e8a-85fb33dbf912,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a cardboard tray containing about 20 cherry tomatoes, some still attached to the vine. Each cherry tomato appears firm and of typical size, approximately 2.5 to 3 cm in diameter. Cherry tomatoes usually weigh between 15 and 20 grams each. Given the number visible and the density, I would estimate each at about 17 grams on average. Multiplying 20 tomatoes by 17 grams gives a total weight of approximately 340 grams. The portion looks full and fresh, consistent with a sold container rather than a small snack portion. This estimate also aligns well with typical retail packaging sizes seen in Swiss markets. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the ""tomates cerises"" in the image to be about 340 grams."
8japfq,fallafels,125.0,280.0,155.0,0.8407828501996181,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/b233fd7c-865a-4287-818f-8d4fe868585e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a bowl containing fresh spinach leaves, sprouted seeds, cherry tomatoes, and a cluster of eight falafels. The falafels are relatively uniform in size, each roughly spherical and about 3-4 cm in diameter. Falafels are dense and crispy fried balls typically weighing around 30-40 grams each. Given there are eight falafels visible, if each weighs around 35 grams on average, that would total approximately 280 grams. The portion looks like a full serving, with no pieces missing or partially visible, so this is a good estimate. Swiss portion sizes for falafels can vary, but this quantity fits a main or substantial side dish portion. Taking all visual and density factors into account, I estimate the total weight of the falafels to be approximately 280 grams."
2ahgvr,salade grecque,315.0,160.0,155.0,2.118772782503038,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/c476a6d0-acb2-45fd-b168-84822bc98003,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a rectangular plastic container partially filled with diced vegetables, olives, onion rings, and small chunks of white cheese consistent with a Greek salad. The portion fills roughly half to two-thirds of the container's volume. Given the container size looks like a standard medium food storage container (about 1 liter capacity), and visual density of the diced vegetables, olives and feta cheese, this salad portion appears moderate in size—not a small snack, but not a large full meal serving either. Typical Greek salad portions weigh around 200-300g as a main dish, but this looks more like a side dish portion. Considering the diced nature and the oil-based salad dressing visible, which adds slight weight, and the density of feta cheese cubes, I estimate a weight range between 130g to 180g, aiming at a medium portion closer to 160g. This estimate respects Swiss portion size guidelines for dense mixed salads (200-300g main dish), adjusted since this is likely a side dish portion in a container. Overall, the weight estimation based on visible volume, density, and container size is approximately 160 grams."
p8a2w5,pillons de poulet,48.0,200.0,152.0,0.3166116993577504,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/a80cc37c-4f30-4827-84cd-91a2f89042c2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two grilled chicken drumsticks (pillons de poulet) on a plate alongside a small portion of tomato, mozzarella and cucumber salad, as well as a piece of white bread. The chicken drumsticks appear to be cooked, with some charring visible. Each drumstick typically weighs between 80 to 120 grams depending on size. These drumsticks look medium-sized but not very large. Given the thickness and the visible size relative to the bread piece, each drumstick is likely around 100 grams. Together, the two drumsticks would weigh approximately 200 grams. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes for meat (120-180g for a side dish), this looks like a medium to slightly larger portion, so 200 grams is a reasonable estimate. I estimate the total weight of the two chicken drumsticks to be about 200 grams."

The image shows a plate containing a salade de tomates made of sliced tomatoes cut into wedges and sprinkled with flax seeds and some green herbs, with balsamic vinegar visible as a dressing. The plate is standard size, indicated by the nearby utensils as reference. The tomato pieces cover most of the plate surface, stacked with moderate thickness. Tomatoes are relatively dense but mostly water, so the weight corresponds to visible volume. Given the size and quantity of tomato wedges, this portion looks like a substantial single serving or a side salad. The flax seeds add minimal weight. Based on typical tomato wedges (about 15-20 wedges) each weighing roughly 15 grams, the total tomato weight is estimated to be between 230 and 300 grams. Considering the volume and distribution, I estimate the weight of the salade de tomates portion to be around 265 grams."

The image shows a bowl with cooked chard stems and leaves (côtes de bettes) in tomato sauce occupying the bottom portion of the bowl, with an omelette au persil resting on top. The chard is clearly visible with cooked, softened stems and leaves in a moderate amount of tomato sauce. Considering the volume and density, as well as the size of the bowl which looks like a typical small-medium soup bowl, the vegetables portion is visibly substantial but not large. Swiss reference portion for cooked vegetables as a side dish ranges between 120 and 180g. Given the considerable volume and the density of the cooked greens and tomato sauce, but that this is likely a side dish portion, the estimate should be in the upper half of this range. The greens and sauce combined appear to be approximately 150-180g. The portion does not overflow the bowl and looks moderately filled. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the weight of the 'côtes de bettes à la sauce tomate' is about 165 grams."
xjvrtk,courgette et oignons,300.0,170.0,130.0,1.692414511369554,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a glass container divided into two portions: on the left, chunks of courgette and onions cooked together, and on the right, several millet, black beans, and corn patties. The courgette and onions are cut into medium-sized pieces and appear to be cooked and soft, with some visible moisture but not floating in a lot of liquid. The portion of courgette and onions occupies roughly half the container. Given the container size is roughly similar to a standard meal prep box (approximately 15x15 cm) and taking into account the volume and typical density of sauteed courgette and onions, I estimate this cooked vegetable mix to weigh between 150 and 200 grams. Considering the moderate fullness and visual density, a medium portion estimated at around 170 grams is reasonable. This aligns well with Swiss portion references for cooked vegetables (120-180g) and the visual evidence here is consistent with the higher end of that range due to the volume present visually."
6fwmw2,mélange de porc et légumes façon thaï,295.0,170.0,125.0,1.6001996181218539,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/6fwmw2/dish_media/ec6d03db-ac9d-4ca2-92e1-96ab989361cb,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a black bowl presenting a dish with rice noodles at the bottom and a mixture of pork and vegetables in a Thai style sauce layered on top. The pork and vegetable mixture consists of visible pieces of broccoli, carrots, bell peppers, mushrooms, and pork chunks in a creamy sauce. The portion in the bowl is medium-sized, filling about half to two-thirds of a standard-sized bowl. The density of the pork and vegetable mix appears moderate to high due to the sauce and compact nature of the pieces. Typically, a side dish of meat and vegetables weighs between 120-180g, but considering the volume visible, it looks closer to the higher end of this range. Given the mixture is spread relatively evenly and appears quite dense, I estimate the weight of the 'mélange de porc et légumes façon thaï' to be about 170 grams. This is consistent with the overall portion size, visual density, and the typical Swiss side dish portion."

The image shows a small plate with white asparagus (asperges) and a dollop of mayonnaise. The asparagus pieces are fairly thick and from visual observation, there are about 9 pieces varying in length from about 6 to 8 cm each. White asparagus is dense and heavy compared to green asparagus. Each piece likely weighs around 30-40 grams depending on thickness and length. Multiplying by 9 pieces, the total weight is probably between 270 and 360 grams. However, the portions look moderately sized and not all pieces are equally thick, so a reasonable estimate is near the middle of this range. Considering also the relatively small plate and the portion size, I estimate the weight of the white asparagus to be approximately 300 grams. This is consistent with a side dish portion of cooked vegetables (120-180g) but visually this serving is somewhat larger, making 300g plausible."
xjvrtk,soupe à la tomate,400.0,280.0,120.0,2.0829717063009894,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/f87a2a81-9c85-454b-af47-38ed4c42554b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a bowl filled with tomato soup containing visible large chunks of whole tomatoes in a liquid base, sprinkled with herbs. The bowl is a small to medium size, typically used for a single serving of soup. The volume of liquid plus the pieces of tomato give an impression of a portion about half to three-quarters full. Tomato soup, especially with visible chunks, is quite dense and moist. The chunks visible occupy a significant portion of the bowl's surface area, indicating a substantial solid component. Considering a typical bowl holds roughly 300-400g of soup, and this bowl is about 70-80% full with chunky tomato soup, it is reasonable to estimate the soup weight in the bowl around 250-320g. Given the density and volume shown, a good estimation is around 280 grams of soupe à la tomate."

The image shows a small glass jar with a golden lid containing porridge salé. The jar appears to be a typical small portion jar, roughly around 200 ml in volume. The porridge fills about 80-85% of the jar's volume. Given the porridge's consistency and density, which is close to that of cooked oatmeal or a thick porridge, its density is approximately 1 g/ml or slightly less. Thus, the porridge's weight is about the volume it occupies. Estimating the jar volume at around 200 ml, and the porridge fill level at 160-170 ml, the weight should be around 160-170 grams. Considering the density and slight variations in porridge texture, estimating the weight at 165 grams is reasonable. This estimate is consistent with the visual evidence and typical portion sizes for this kind of dish served in small jars."

The image shows four pieces of sweet potato waffles (gaufre à la patate douce) arranged on a plate. Each waffle piece is a segment of a typical waffle grid, roughly square-shaped and about 6-7 cm per side and about 1.5-2 cm thick. Sweet potato waffles are denser than regular waffles because of the sweet potato content. Given that these are cooked waffles, their moisture content reduces the weight slightly but they remain dense. Estimating each quarter-piece to weigh approximately 45-55 grams, the total waffle weight is around 180-220 grams. This aligns with the typical portion size of a main dish starch component, which ranges higher in density for sweet potato compared to regular wheat waffles. Based on visual appearance, the waffles are not overly thick but a solid portion, so I estimate the sweet potato waffles at about 200 grams total."

The image shows a glass container with gnocchi au basilic mixed with some cooked cauliflower florets and topped with grated cheese. The gnocchi are medium-sized pieces, and I estimate about 15-18 gnocchi pieces visible. Typical cooked gnocchi weigh roughly 10-15 grams each, but these look like a standard portion with moderate coating of sauce and cheese. Considering the container size and visible amount, the gnocchi portion appears to be a medium serving. A range of 150 to 220 grams seems plausible. Given the gnocchi coverage in the container and the presence of cauliflower around, I estimate around 180 grams for the gnocchi portion, as the main mass in the container."
wrah5h,tofu à la mangue,80.0,190.0,110.0,0.3818781461551814,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/712f4686-2c54-47d3-a8f2-811e15f6e76b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a rectangular metal container with a mix of various plant-based foods. The 'tofu à la mangue' is located on the bottom left side as several medium-sized yellowish cubed pieces, distinct from the other ingredients. Each cube is roughly 3-4 cm across, and there are about 7-8 visible pieces. Tofu is a dense food, and the mango marinade or seasoning might add slight moisture but not considerably change its density. Given the size and number of cubes, it looks like a medium portion. Typical tofu pieces size around 30-40g each when cubed like this, but considering these pieces are relatively small and in a seasoned form, I estimate each cube to be around 25-30g. Multiplying by about 7 pieces gives an internal range of 175-210g. Considering some pieces might be partially visible or underneath, I'll balance the estimate near the middle of this range. This portion appears to be a substantial side dish amount, consistent with Swiss servings. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of 'tofu à la mangue' in this container to be approximately 190 grams."

The image shows a black bowl containing a mixture of oats soaked with chia seeds and some form of liquid (likely milk or yogurt) to produce a creamy porridge-like texture. The oats (flocons d'avoine) portion is the large creamy mass on the left side of the bowl, partially topped with peanut butter and surrounded by chocolate chips, raspberries, and blueberries. The volume of this oat mixture covers approximately half the surface of the bowl and is moderately thick, indicating a soaked oat portion with some hydration absorbed by the oats and chia seeds. Considering the density of soaked oats is less than dry oats but still substantial due to liquid content, and visually comparing to the size of the berries (average raspberry weighs ~4g) and chocolate chips, this looks like a medium portion of oats typically used for one serving of overnight oats or oatmeal. A typical dry oat serving is around 40-50g, but soaked oats with added volume from chia seeds and liquid usually weigh more. I estimate the total weight of the soaked oats portion (flocons d'avoine plus chia seeds and liquid absorbed) to be around 130-160 grams. Choosing a reasonable midpoint given the size and thickness, I estimate approximately 145 grams."

The image shows a single slice of tarte flambée with chopped rhubarb and apple pieces arranged on top. The size of the slice is roughly a quarter of a standard rectangular tarte flambée. The crust appears thin and crisp, typical for tarte flambée, and the toppings look moderately dense but not thick. Given the visible surface area and estimating the depth/thickness of the slice including the fruit topping and cream base, I estimate the weight to be around 130-160 grams. Tarte flambée slices are usually between 150-200 grams for a full slice, but this slice looks slightly thin and not overly dense. Therefore, a medium estimate of 145 grams is reasonable and consistent with the visible portion size and density."

The image shows a small white bowl filled with sliced strawberries covered with granulated sugar. The strawberry pieces are medium-sized, approximately 12 to 14 pieces are visible, which appear to be about one-quarter to one-third of a whole strawberry each. Considering the size of the bowl and the spoon for scale, the quantity looks like a modest single-serving portion. Strawberry pieces are dense but have some air inside them. A whole medium strawberry weighs around 15-20g, so about 4 pieces (one strawberry) would be approximately 15-20g. With about 12-14 pieces visible, this equates to roughly 3 to 4 whole strawberries. That suggests a total weight range between 45g to 80g. Considering some variability in size and that not all pieces are equal, a good estimate is about 65 grams. The sugar is not weighed as part of the strawberries. This estimation is consistent with a light fruit snack portion rather than a full fruit dessert serving."

The dish is a mixed plate of roasted vegetables and feta, including pommes de terre, carottes, panais, aubergines, and racines rouges. The food item to estimate is 'panais'. Visually, the panais pieces are cut into chunks approximately 2-3 cm long and mixed with the other vegetables. The portion of panais seems to be about 5-7 chunks scattered throughout the pile. Each chunk of roasted parsnip typically weighs around 15-20g due to its dense, starchy nature. Multiplying by the number of pieces, the total weight of panais looks to be roughly in the range of 80 to 140 grams. Considering the moderate volume compared to the entire portion and the density of roasted parsnips, I estimate the weight to be about 110 grams. This fits within plausible serving size for a side vegetable component in Switzerland and matches the comparative portion sizes of the other vegetables on the plate."
ppf8hc,quinoa et boulgour au curry,236.0,145.0,91.0,0.9319562575941677,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/95e84def-c82b-4360-8390-f5153ff61064,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The food item to estimate is ""quinoa et boulgour au curry."" The image shows a yellow bell pepper (poivrons jaune) stuffed with a well-packed mixture of quinoa and bulgur seasoned with curry. The bell pepper is halved, with one half stuffed and standing upright on the plate and two slices of pepper next to it. The stuffing is compact and slightly heaped above the pepper rim, indicating a decent volume. Given the size of the pepper, I estimate its capacity to be roughly 120-150 grams for the stuffing. Quinoa and bulgur cooked and mixed are moderately dense but contain air spaces due to the grain nature. Considering this and the tightly packed appearance, the weight of the quinoa and bulgur mixture appears closer to the higher end of that range. Comparing with typical side dish portion sizes for grains in Swiss meals (80-200g for rice/pasta equivalents), this looks like a proper small-to-medium portion serving. Therefore, estimating the stuffed quinoa and bulgur filling, I conclude a weight range of about 130-160 grams, with a final estimate around 145 grams as a balanced value between the size, volume, and density."
wrah5h,porc,52.0,140.0,88.0,0.19857663600069433,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/f727ac79-973e-4b92-8f2b-cda94222d4a7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'porc' (pork), which is located on the bottom left of the container under a white creamy sauce. The pork portion appears to be a single cooked piece, roughly the size of the palm of a hand but thinner. The sauce on top obscures some details but the piece does not appear overly thick or large. Given that the container holds other items including polenta with shredded cheese and grilled aubergine, the pork is likely a side portion rather than a large main cut. Swiss reference weight for meat as a side dish is typically 120-180g. Visually, the pork piece here appears medium sized but not very thick or massive, closer to the lower-middle of that range. Considering the visible size and portion relative to other foods, and accounting for some volume hidden under sauce, I estimate the pork weight at about 140 grams. This fits well within typical Swiss side dish portions and matches visual evidence without overestimation."
xjvrtk,aubergine au four,145.0,230.0,85.0,0.5348463808366603,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/9f3cc64b-7ef7-4fff-b125-8e011b8ffb93,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with roasted eggplant slices ('aubergine au four') alongside sliced tomatoes, scrambled eggs, and grated parmesan. The aubergine slices are large, long, and fairly thin, with four slices visible on the plate. Roasted eggplant loses some water and thus weight compared to raw, but still retains volume and density. Each slice appears about 15-20 cm long and quite thin, typical of a medium-sized eggplant's half or slices. A medium whole eggplant weighs around 300-400g raw, and roasting reduces weight approximately by 20-30%. Four large roasted slices here appear to be roughly equivalent to one medium eggplant or slightly less. Considering volume and density, a plausible weight range is between 200-280 grams. Since the plate includes other bulky components but the aubergine fills a significant portion of the plate, and given the visual flatness of the slices, I estimate the aubergine au four weight around 230 grams."
wrah5h,poire,183.0,100.0,83.0,0.6591303593126193,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/cb6a4333-4844-427b-b4a5-d13df89508f1,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plastic container with several slices of pear ('poire'). The slices are relatively large, including both skin and flesh. A whole medium pear typically weighs around 150-180 grams. The amount seen here appears to be roughly half to two-thirds of one medium pear, considering the size and thickness of the slices and the container's visible dimensions. The pieces do not fill the entire container, and the slices appear moderately thick. Based on this visual evidence and typical pear weights, I estimate the total weight of the pear slices to be approximately 100 grams."

The food item to estimate is 'gratin de côtes de bettes,' which appears on the plate to the right of the vegetarian steak and beneath some grated parmesan. It is a dense, creamy vegetable gratin portion about the size of a half to one cup. Visual comparison with the pasta portion shows that the gratin is moderately sized but not very thick, and it covers about 1/5 of the plate surface with visible cheese and leafy vegetable layers. Swiss vegetable side dish portions generally range from 120-180g, but gratins tend to be denser and more compact than fresh salads or steamed vegetables. Given the plate context with four distinct components (pasta, steak, gratin, romanesco), portions are likely moderate. The gratin looks like a medium side portion, not a small or large one, and given the density and visible volume, a weight in the middle of the vegetable side range plus some margin is appropriate. I estimate the gratin de côtes de bettes at approximately 150 grams."
ppf8hc,poissons panés,140.0,220.0,80.0,0.48602673147023084,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/5dfa5302-a2e6-4c74-94fd-8e014ec012bc,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'poissons panés' (breaded fish). The image shows three rectangular breaded fish pieces occupying about one third of the plate. Each piece appears to be of moderate size, roughly similar to a typical fish stick or fish fillet portion, around 10 cm long and 4-5 cm wide, with moderate thickness. Breaded fish tends to be fairly dense given breading and fish content. Typically, one fish stick or breaded fish fillet in a home meal weighs about 70-90 grams. With three pieces present, and considering their visible size and thickness, the total weight likely falls in the range of 200 to 270 grams. Since the three pieces look similar in size and fully visible with no broken parts, I estimate about 220 grams total. This estimate fits well with the visible portion size and typical Swiss serving sizes for fish side dishes. The estimation is consistent with the overall plate composition, which includes a moderate portion of pasta and broccoli, indicating standard side dish quantities."
ppf8hc,poivrons jaune,150.0,70.0,80.0,0.5207429265752473,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/95e84def-c82b-4360-8390-f5153ff61064,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'poivrons jaune' (yellow peppers). In the image, there is a large stuffed yellow bell pepper cut in half, with one half filled with quinoa and bulgur, and the other half sliced into two pieces placed on the plate. The pepper pieces look cooked, as evidenced by their slightly shriveled texture and browning. Considering the size relative to the fork in the background (a standard table fork), the pepper halves represent a medium-sized bell pepper. A medium yellow bell pepper typically weighs around 120-150 grams when raw. Cooking reduces water content, but the weight remains close. The cut slices likely represent about half the pepper by weight, so the two slices together plus the hollowed shell holding the grain filling correspond to the whole pepper. Since quinoa and bulgur filling occupy the pepper cavity, the pepper flesh weight is just the pepper halves/slices themselves, excluding filling. In the image, the pepper flesh visible as slices on the plate is about two medium-sized pieces. Visually, the slices appear to be about half the original pepper's flesh weight. Given typical pepper size and cooking effect, the slices together likely weigh about 60-75 grams. Considering the size and cooked state, I estimate the weight of the yellow pepper slices (the 'poivrons jaune') shown on the plate at about 70 grams. This estimate matches the visual volume and typical pepper flesh density, ensuring plausibility."

The hummus au basilic is in the small glass container at the top left of the image. It appears to be a single serving portion, with a smooth, dense paste filling about half of a small transparent glass. The glass size is roughly comparable to a small dessert or espresso cup, typically around 80-100 ml volume. Given the density of hummus, which is thick and moist, a half-glass serving would likely weigh between 100g and 130g. Commonly, store-bought single-serving hummus containers are in the range of 100-125g. The visible portion fits this standard size well, with no excess nor minimal amount. Considering this and Swiss portion sizes for dips and spreads, I estimate the hummus au basilic to weigh approximately 110 grams."

The image shows a slice of 'délice des dieux' on a small dessert plate. This dessert consists of a biscuit base, a layer of mixed red fruits (fruits rouges), and a topping of a creamy séré + mascarpone mixture. The slice appears to be around 8 cm by 7 cm in area and roughly 2.5 cm thick. The biscuit base looks moist but moderately dense, and the cream layer is thick and creamy, covering the fruits and biscuit entirely. There are a few fresh berries on the top giving an idea of scale: the raspberries and blueberries are typical size, about 2 cm each. Based on the slice size, layer thickness, and density of ingredients, the portion is relatively small to medium for a dessert slice. Typical dessert slices of this type weigh between 100 and 150 grams. Considering the moderate thickness, the creamy and fruit portions, and the biscuit base, I estimate the weight is approximately 130 grams. This fits within typical serving weights for such a dessert portion and is consistent with the visual size on the plate."

The brochette de boeuf is located at the top center of the plate, consisting of three sizable chunks of grilled beef on a skewer. Each chunk appears thick and dense, roughly about 3-4 cm on each side, making three medium-sized pieces. Typically, beef chunks on a skewer weigh approximately 40-60 grams each depending on size and density. Given the visible volume and density, and considering that this is served alongside a sausage (mergez), pasta salad, bread, and sauce suggesting a meal with moderate portions, I assess the brochette's total weight as medium-sized, roughly around 140-170 grams. This fits typical side dish meat portion sizes (120-180g) in Switzerland. After visual comparison with the adjacent mergez sausage and pasta salad, the 150 grams estimate is plausible and balanced with other items on the plate."

The image shows a plate with three distinct components: two fried eggs, a portion of white rice, and a portion of ratatouille. The ratatouille consists mostly of cooked vegetables such as zucchini, tomatoes, onions, and bell peppers, visible on the right side of the plate. It occupies roughly one quarter of the plate area. The vegetables appear cooked and compacted with some sauce, making the dish denser than raw vegetables but lighter than meat. Considering Swiss side dish portion sizes for cooked vegetables (120-180g) and judging by the volume and density of the ratatouille portion visible, it appears to be a medium to medium-large side portion. Since the ratatouille almost fills a quarter of a medium-sized dinner plate and has some compaction, I estimate it weighs about 160 grams. This estimate is consistent with the portion relative to the rice and eggs and fits within the typical Swiss side portion range."

The image shows a bowl containing a mixture of rice and dahl de lentilles (lentil stew). The lentil dahl is the reddish-orange portion with visible chunks of lentils, carrots, and onions. It appears to cover approximately half to slightly more than half of the bowl volume. Considering the standard bowl size, the depth of the dish, and the dense texture of cooked lentils and vegetables in the stew, the portion looks substantial but not overly large. Swiss portion references for legume dishes range between 180-250g for a main dish, and given that this dahl likely constitutes the main part of the meal, the portion seems in the medium range of that scale. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the dahl de lentilles in the bowl to be about 210 grams, balancing the visual fullness and density."

The chou romanesco is the green fractal vegetable portion on the upper right side of the plate. The amount is about 6-8 medium-sized florets, cooked but still retaining volume and some firmness. Compared to the other items on the plate—pasta on the left, gratin on the lower right, and the vegetarian steak in the center—the chou romanesco portion appears to be a side dish size. Swiss cooked vegetable side dishes typically range from 120-180g. Considering the florets are loosely placed but relatively dense compared to leafy greens, and the portion looks about medium, I estimate it weighs around 140-150 grams. A lower amount would underestimate the visible volume and a higher would seem excessive given the plate spacing. Therefore, my final estimate for the chou romanesco portion is 145 grams."

The salade de céleri is located at the bottom right corner of the plate, consisting of a small mound of shredded white celery root, likely prepared as a celery root remoulade or a grated celery salad. Visually, the portion is compact but not piled very high, roughly about the size of half a fist. Considering the density of celery root and the dressing moisture that adds some weight, this portion looks like a medium side serving rather than a large main dish portion. Swiss side salad portions for dense mixed salads are typically 120-180g; since this is a fairly small to medium heap but dense, I estimate it to be slightly below the midpoint range for a side dish, about 110-130 grams. Given the volume and density visible, I estimate the weight of the salade de céleri on the plate to be approximately 120 grams."

The betterave (beetroot) is seen on the left side of the plate as chopped, cooked cubes. The pieces look dense and moist, occupying approximately a quarter of the plate's visible food area. Compared to the other items, the beetroot portion is moderate but distinct in volume. Given the density of cooked beetroot and the visible quantity, it appears to be a medium portion. Swiss reference portion for cooked vegetables is 120-180g, but considering this is a side portion with moderate volume and thickness, the weight is likely on the lower end of this range. I estimate the portion of betterave here weighs approximately between 120 and 150 grams, with a balanced final estimate of 135 grams."

The image shows a slice of strawberry tart (tarte aux fraises) on a dessert plate. The tart slice appears to be moderately thick with a creamy filling and multiple whole and halved strawberries on top, along with some red currants. The strawberry pieces are sizable and fresh. The tart crust appears crumbly with some fragments around the slice. Comparing the tart slice size relative to the plate and the visible fork in the background, the slice is a typical medium serving size of a dessert tart. Typically, a whole tart weighs around 700-800g, and a medium slice is about one-eighth of that, so roughly 85-100g. Since the slice looks fairly rich with generous fruit topping and cream, I expect the weight to be near the upper part of this range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this tarte aux fraises slice at approximately 95 grams."

The image shows a small piece of fruit bread (pain aux fruits) held between the fingers, which provides a good size reference. The piece appears to be dense and includes visible pieces of dried fruit and nuts, with some coarse sugar on the surface. The size corresponds roughly to a small handheld bread portion, approximately 6-7 cm across and about 2-3 cm thick. Considering the density of fruit bread, which is typically heavier than plain white bread due to added dried fruit and nuts, and the compact size, I estimate the weight of this piece to be slightly less than a typical slice of standard bread (which is about 30-40g for a normal slice). Given the size and density, a reasonable estimate is around 25-35 grams. As the piece isn't a full slice but a smaller partial piece, I choose the lower-middle weight in this range. Therefore, the estimated weight is approximately 30 grams."

The image shows two slices of dessert on a plate, with the specified food item being the tiramisu on the left side. The tiramisu slice appears to be about average size for a single serving, with visible layers of creamy mascarpone and soaked sponge. It occupies roughly the size of half the plate's diameter but is not very thick – approximately 3-4 cm in height. Given typical individual tiramisu slice weights from bakeries in Switzerland, portions generally range between 120-160g per slice. Considering this slice is somewhat compact but not excessively dense or large, the weight likely falls near the middle of this range. The smaller surface area and moderate thickness visually confirm this estimation. Therefore, I estimate the tiramisu slice weighs about 140 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing a serving of plain yogurt (yogourt nature). The yogurt appears creamy and has a moderately thick consistency but is only covering the bottom of the bowl with a relatively shallow layer. The bowl itself seems like a standard small to medium sized cereal or snack bowl, and the amount of yogurt looks to be a modest portion, neither a full standard 125g container nor just a small spoonful. Given these visual cues, and considering that plain yogurt typically has a density close to water (around 1 g/ml), the volume here suggests an amount around 100 grams. This fits well within a common single serving portion for yogurt. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the yogourt nature to be approximately 100 grams."

The image shows a small remaining portion of salade de pâtes (pasta salad) on a plate. The salad consists of penne pasta, some cherry tomato pieces, corn kernels, and small bits of other ingredients like herbs. The amount left on the plate is sparse; only about 10-12 pieces of penne with some scattered vegetables remain. Considering pasta salad density and typical cooked pasta weights, a full portion usually ranges from 180-250 grams. However, this visible portion is about a quarter or less of a full serving, appearing quite thinly spread and partially eaten. Given the small quantity, and accounting for volume and the mixed ingredients visible, the estimated weight of the remaining salade de pâtes is around 40-50 grams. This aligns logically with the visual size and the known weight ranges."

The image shows a small green bowl containing four whole strawberries. Each strawberry appears to be medium to large size, with good volume and density typical for fresh strawberries. Considering that an average medium strawberry weighs about 15-20 grams, and given that these are relatively large strawberries, I estimate each to be closer to 20 grams. Multiplying by four strawberries, the total weight should be around 80 grams. Given the size variety and slight irregularities, I establish a plausible range of 70-90 grams and choose a final value of 80 grams as a balanced estimate."

The ratatouille is located in the top right section of the plate. It is a cooked vegetable dish composed mainly of zucchini, eggplant, and tomatoes, appearing diced and cooked down into a moist, thick vegetable stew. The volume looks moderate, roughly a small heap about the size of half a cup to slightly more, with some density due to the cooked vegetables and sauce. Compared to the bulgur on the plate, the ratatouille portion is clearly smaller but dense and moist. Swiss portion references for cooked vegetables range from 120-180g for a side dish. This serving looks like a slightly smaller than average side portion, probably closer to the lower-middle end of that range. Taking into account its moist texture and volume, I estimate the weight of the ratatouille to be approximately 130 grams. This estimate is plausible given the visible quantity, density, and Swiss portion norms."

The target food item is 'tomates cerises' (cherry tomatoes), visible on the left side of the plate. There are five whole cherry tomatoes, each approximately 3-4 cm in diameter. Cherry tomatoes typically weigh around 15-20 grams each depending on size and ripeness. Given the size observed and the typical weight range, each tomato here looks average-sized, so about 17 grams per tomato is a reasonable average. Multiplying by five tomatoes gives a total weight estimate within the range of 75 to 90 grams. Considering visual fullness and no apparent damage or shriveling, a final estimate near the middle of this range, around 82 grams, is appropriate. This aligns with typical cherry tomato weights and is plausible given the relative portion size compared to the other foods on the plate."

The image shows two breaded chicken fillets ('filet de poulet pané') placed on a bed of cooked basmati rice and carrot slices inside a medium-sized glass container. Each fillet appears relatively thin and moderately sized, similar to a small to medium chicken breast portion. Generally, a single medium chicken breast fillet weighs around 120-150 grams, but these fillets look slightly smaller and thinner, possibly around 90-110 grams each. Combined, the two fillets likely weigh between 180-220 grams. Given their modest size but two pieces combined, I estimate the total weight of the breaded chicken fillets to be approximately 200 grams."

The image shows a metal container with several distinct food items arranged separately. The tomatoes are on the left side and appear as peeled slices or chunks, deep red in color and moist. The portion of tomato visible occupies roughly a quarter of the container's left side, next to avocado and tofu. The tomato pieces are dense and moderately thick, but not piled very high. Considering the overall container size (which looks like a standard lunchbox container approximately 18-20 cm wide), the visible tomato portion is medium-sized. Given the average density of tomato and the volume seen, the weight is likely between 90 and 130 grams. Tomato is often a juicy vegetable and not very dense, so the weight is not very high despite visible volume. The estimate within this range, considering the size and visual fullness, is about 110 grams. This sits well with Swiss portion norms for a tomato side dish and the relative amounts of other foods in the container."

The salade de riz (rice salad) is located on the right side of the plate, recognizable by the white rice grains mixed with small pieces of red pepper and herbs. The portion is fairly compact and covers a small area of the plate compared to the other salads and the roast meat. Considering the plate size and typical side dish portions, this portion seems moderate but not large. Swiss portion reference for rice side dishes is 80-200 grams. Given the visual size and density of rice, the portion here appears to be on the smaller to medium side, since it occupies about a quarter of the plate's food space. I estimate a plausible range of 100-140 grams and will choose a medium value closer to 120 grams to reflect the visible amount. This fits well with the other items and typical serving sizes for rice salad as a side."

The image shows a plate with three main food items: haricots rouges (red kidney beans), pâtes (pasta), and a dollop of mozzarella. The haricots rouges portion is on the left side of the plate and consists of cooked kidney beans with some herbs. Visually, the pile of beans covers a modest but solid area, appearing to be a side portion rather than a main dish. Comparing the size of the beans with the pasta and the fork on the left side, the beans cover an approximate volume similar to about a small hand full. Kidney beans are quite dense, so the portion looks substantial even if the volume isn't huge. Given that a typical side portion of cooked kidney beans ranges between 120-180g, and considering the portion size appears medium, slightly less than half the plate's pasta portion, I'd estimate the haricots rouges portion around 140-160g. My final estimate for the haricots rouges weight is 150 grams."

The image shows a white plate divided roughly in two halves: one with cooked rotini pasta and a chili mixture on the other side, with a small amount of crème fraîche in between. The chili contains visible chunks of cervelas sausage and kidney beans in a thick tomato-based sauce. Considering the plate size appears to be standard and comparing the pasta volume on the left, the chili portion occupies about half of the plate area. The chili is dense, with large sausage pieces and beans visible. Swiss portion range for legume dishes is 180-250g, but this chili also contains sausage pieces which add to the weight. Given the portion is a main part of the meal and the visible sausage chunks, a mid to large portion is apparent. I estimate a plausible weight range around 220-270g for the chili. Choosing a value that matches the visual thickness and volume, I estimate the chili weight at approximately 250 grams."

The image shows a medium-sized bowl containing a mixed salad of diced cooked beets, cucumber, and some powdery seasoning (gomasio). The cucumbers are cut into chunks roughly 1.5-2 cm in size. The bowl is about half-full. Comparing the size of the cucumber pieces to the full bowl and the glass nearby (standard water glass) provides a good reference for scale. The cucumber pieces appear fresh and provide volume but are less dense than the beets. Since the cucumbers are mixed with other ingredients, they probably constitute about 40-50% of the volume of the salad in the bowl. A typical medium cucumber weighs about 250-300g whole, but here the cucumber is only part of the mixture and is chopped into pieces. Estimating the visible portion of cucumber in the bowl, considering half the bowl filled with mixed veggies and approximately half that mass being cucumbers, I estimate the cucumber weight at about 70-100 grams. Given the density and volume observed, a medium estimate of about 85 grams for the cucumber portion is plausible."

The image shows one whole cooked artichaut placed on a plate being held by a hand, which gives a good size reference. The artichoke appears medium-sized, with the outer leaves intact and folded in a typical way. Given the typical size and density of a cooked artichoke, and considering the scale compared to the fingers holding the plate, the artichoke likely weighs between 150 and 250 grams. Since this artichoke looks fairly standard and not overly large or small, I estimate the weight to be around 200 grams. This is consistent with typical Swiss portions of a single artichoke served as a side or small main vegetable item."
ppf8hc,tresse au beurre,53.0,110.0,57.0,0.13109703176531853,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/5ed8ce20-0563-4e69-8fad-260878497dad,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a portion of a tresse au beurre, a braided buttery bread piece, placed on a glass plate. The bread appears to be about half of a small to medium-sized tresse. Its height and width suggest a dense, slightly compacted bread shape typical of this type. By comparing it to the slice of gruyère cheese below it, which is roughly standard slice size (around 30-40 grams), the bread portion looks somewhat larger in volume but less dense than cheese. Since a full tresse au beurre typically weighs around 200-250 grams depending on size, this half-portion is likely within the 90-130 grams range. Considering the visible size, I estimate the weight of the tresse au beurre pictured to be approximately 110 grams."
p8a2w5,"dalh de lentilles corail (lentilles corail, oignon, carottes, tomates concassées, 1cs huilde d'olive, épices)",271.0,215.0,56.0,0.6585662211421628,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/82b53493-1c97-472b-9ec6-8cc698b8cfe4,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a bowl with two main components: cooked white rice occupying roughly half of the bowl, and the dalh de lentilles corail, which is a thick stew made of coral lentils, carrots, onions, tomatoes, and olive oil, occupying the other half. The dalh has a chunky texture with visible pieces of carrot and onion mixed with the lentils in a somewhat dense but moist consistency. Given the bowl appears medium-sized and the dalh portion fills about half of it with some depth, the volume is substantial. Considering lentil dishes tend to be dense, and Swiss reference portion for legume dishes is about 180-250g, while the visible amount is not extremely large but definitely a full serving, I estimate the weight of the dalh de lentilles corail to be in a range of 200-230g. Picking a value within that range considering the visible portion size and density, I conclude the dalh weighs approximately 215 grams."

The image shows a small bowl with several mozzarella balls, cherry tomatoes, and fresh basil leaves. The mozzarella appears to be small bocconcini type balls, which typically weigh around 15-20 grams each. There are about 5 mozzarella balls visible. Given their size and assuming that these are fresh mozzarella balls of standard bocconcini size, each roughly 18 grams on average, the total weight would be approximately 90 grams. Since all mozzarella balls seem to be fully visible and there is no indication of partial pieces, this estimation is based on the full count. This is consistent with a modest side portion of mozzarella in a small salad bowl. The basil leaves are light and do not affect the mozzarella weight. Considering this, a range of 80-100 grams would be reasonable, and I select the final estimate as 90 grams."

The target food item is 'yogourt'. The yogourt is shown in a typical single-serve plastic cup that is mostly full to the top. A standard single-serve yogourt container in Switzerland usually contains around 125 grams. Given the cup is nearly full and appears to be a standard size, the weight of the yogourt can be estimated close to this typical serving size. Given no visible spillage or removal, estimating it at about 125 grams is reasonable and consistent with common packaging and portion sizes."

The image shows a plate with an assortment of cheeses, a slice of bread, smoked trout, and butter. The specified item 'fromage de brebis/chèvre (2 bouts)' corresponds to the two small chunks of cheese on the left-central part of the plate: one is creamier in a small rind, and the other is a thin slice of semi-hard cheese. Each piece appears quite small. Estimating the weight, the bouts look like roughly 30-40 grams each given their size relative to the slice of bread and other cheese pieces. Together, the two bouts should weigh about 60-80 grams. Given their size as small servings (two small pieces), I estimate the combined weight of the 'fromage de brebis/chèvre (2 bouts)' to be about 70 grams."
p8a2w5,2eme poulet,46.0,100.0,54.0,0.10779378580107621,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/ff6e3f38-43e0-4b06-8a58-63fa5b77ccc8,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The '2eme poulet' refers to the second chicken skewer on the plate, which is lighter in color than the first one and appears to be grilled pieces of chicken on a stick. Visually, the skewer shows about 3 medium-sized chunks of chicken. Each chunk of grilled chicken of that size typically weighs around 25-35 grams depending on thickness and density. Given that the pieces appear slightly chunky but lean, the total portion looks to be medium-sized. Comparing it to the bread piece and shredded carrots on the plate helps calibrate the size: the chicken skewer length is about 15 cm, consistent with standard skewers. The visible volume and thickness suggest a total weight between 80 and 120 grams. Considering the middle range and the fact it is a side portion rather than a main portion, I estimate the '2eme poulet' weight to be approximately 100 grams."

The image shows two slices of spinach pizza on a standard dinner plate, which gives a good size reference. Each slice has a thin to medium crust with an even layer of melted cheese and a noticeable topping of cooked spinach, which tends to be light but can add some weight due to moisture and density after cooking. The slices look like typical reasonable pizza slices from a medium pizza; the total visible pizza portion is about 1/3 to 1/2 of a standard small-to-medium pizza. A typical medium spinach pizza usually weighs around 600-700g total, so two slices (roughly a quarter to a third of it) would weigh about 150-220 grams. Considering these slices are not overly thick or heavily topped, I estimate the total weight of these two slices to be approximately 190 grams. Dividing roughly by two, one slice would be about 95 grams. Since the task is for one specific food item but the input is the whole two slices, I'll estimate for one slice, which is the visible pizza slice (half of the visible pizza). Therefore, the weight of one slice of spinach pizza is around 95 grams."

The salade verte (green salad) is located on the left side of the plate and includes leafy greens topped with a mix of seeds. The portion is not very dense or piled up, rather it spreads thinly under and around the tomato slices. Given the visible quantity and typical density of mixed leafy greens, as well as the seeds scattered on top, the salad portion appears small to medium-sized. Swiss reference for leafy salads as side dishes is about 60-100g. Considering the plate also contains pasta and sliced cured meat, the salad serves as a side, which aligns with the observed moderate volume. The salad seems to be closer to the lower-middle of this range because the leaves are loosely arranged, not compacted. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the salade verte to be approximately 75 grams."

The image shows a nectarine held in a person's hand, providing a good size reference. The nectarine appears medium-sized, roughly fitting within the palm's center. Typically, a medium nectarine weighs between 140 and 180 grams. Given its visible size and fullness without being overly large or small, it is reasonable to estimate it on the middle range of a medium fruit. Based on this, the likely weight is around 160 grams. This fits well within the typical fruit portion size range of 120-180 grams used as a Swiss reference for fruits."

The image shows a white square plate containing four distinct food items, including 'salade de pomme de terre' (potato salad) located at the bottom left corner. The potato salad consists of sliced potatoes covered with a creamy dressing. Visually, it occupies a moderate portion of the plate, roughly about a quarter of the surface, and the potato slices are fairly thick and dense. Given the typical density of cooked potato slices in dressing and the volume seen here, the portion looks to be medium-sized for a side dish. Swiss portion references for cooked vegetable side dishes range from 120 to 180 grams. Considering the visible amount and the creamy nature making it a bit heavier, the portion likely weighs closer to the higher side of this range. A reasonable estimated weight range would be 140-180 grams, and I will select an intermediate value of 160 grams as the best estimate."

The target food item is 'tomate', which is visually identified on the right side of the container as a sliced tomato. The slices appear to come from one medium-sized tomato, as all are stacked together and represent a single fruit. The size of the container and the relative volume of the other foods (blé and gratin de côte de bette) provide context; the tomato slices occupy a volume consistent with approximately one medium tomato. Given that a medium tomato typically weighs between 120-180 grams in Swiss portion reference, and we see the entire tomato sliced, the weight should be close to that range. The tomato looks fresh and dense, and there are about five to six slices visible. Therefore, the estimated weight would be around 140 grams, reflecting a medium-sized tomato with typical density and no visible loss or damage. This fits well compared to the other portions, which are moderate in size, indicating this is not a tiny or extra-large tomato."

The image shows a white bowl containing an apricot-flavored industrial yogurt with visible small pieces of apricot. The yogurt portion does not fill the bowl fully, but forms a thick layer approximately 2-3 cm high in a medium-sized bowl. Standard single-serving industrial yogurts with fruit pieces typically weigh around 125-150 grams. Given the volume visible here, which is a bit less than a full standard individual container, the portion appears to be slightly smaller. Taking into account the density of yogurt (similar to water/soft cream) and the apricot pieces scattered inside, I estimate the weight to be around 120 grams. This aligns with typical household servings and the visual evidence provided."

The image shows a small white bowl containing a serving of bircher maison (which is a creamy oat-based dish) alongside a portion of fruits rouges décongelés (defrosted red berries). The fruits rouges are visibly piled on one side of the bowl, appearing as a moderate quantity of mixed red berries in a somewhat mashed or syrupy state due to being defrosted. Considering the bowl size relative to a typical small dessert or breakfast bowl, the fruits rouges portion seems to be about half the volume of the bowl. Red berries have a relatively low density, but this portion is compact and moist. A typical portion of fresh berries ranges from 120-180g. Given the slightly mashed defrosted state, and the visual volume occupying about half the bowl, I estimate this portion to be on the smaller-to-medium side of the typical fruit portion range. Thus, the plausible range is about 80-130g, and selecting a medium estimate, I conclude approximately 110 grams of fruits rouges décongelés are present."

The image shows a white bowl containing cereals with milk. The cereals appear to be a mixture of flakes and some small chunks, partially submerged in milk. The bowl is not filled to the top and the cereal layer is relatively thin, covering the bottom of a medium-sized cereal bowl. Given the typical density and lightness of breakfast cereals, and considering the visible depth of the cereal layer, the portion looks to be a modest serving. Usually, a standard serving of dry cereals in Switzerland is around 30-40 grams before milk is added, but because the cereal here is already mixed with milk and is visually thin, the weight appears to be about 25-30 grams of dry cereal. Given some visual margin, I estimate the weight of the cereals alone to be around 28 grams. This fits with the visible volume and does not overestimate the portion seen."

The image shows a standard drinking glass filled to near the brim with cider ('cidre'). The glass appears to be roughly the size of a typical pint or similar drinking glass, common in many beverage servings. Standard pint glasses hold about 473 ml of liquid. Since the glass is nearly full and the density of cider is close to that of water (approximately 1 g/ml), the weight in grams will be almost equivalent to the volume in milliliters. Given this and visible context of the glass shape and fill level, I estimate the weight of the cider to be approximately 450 grams, accounting for a little less than a full pint due to some space at the top."

The image shows a rectangular glass container divided into three portions: boulgour, ratatouille, and two halves of a hard boiled egg (œuf dur). The boulgour occupies about one third of the container's area. The grains are loosely packed but fill a moderate volume, appearing dense enough. The container is medium-sized, roughly 15 cm x 15 cm, and the boulgour depth looks about 3-4 cm. Given this volume and density, the portion is substantial but not large. Considering reference Swiss portions for grain-based side dishes (around 80-200g), this appears to be a medium portion. The ratatouille and egg occupy the remaining space, indicating the meal is balanced with smaller portions of each. Considering the visual volume and plausible density for cooked boulgour, I estimate the weight to be around 120 grams, within a plausible range of 110-140 grams, adjusted for the specific quantity visible."

Given the visible size and comparing it to the sandwich on the plate, these carrots look standard-sized, not unusually large or small. There are two carrots, so the total weight should be approximately double the average. Therefore, the total weight of the two carrots is likely around 130-140 grams. To avoid underestimation, I'll estimate on the slightly higher end of this range. The weight of the carrots is approximately 135 grams."

The food item to estimate is 'tofu à la mangue,' which appears in the image as two rectangular yellow tofu pieces placed on top of a galette wrap, along with visible feta and shredded gruyère cheese and a slice of roasted aubergine. Each tofu piece is similar in size to a small cheese slice or a thick finger portion. Estimating the size based on the wrap diameter (roughly 25-27 cm), each tofu piece looks about 6-7 cm long, 2.5-3 cm wide, and about 1.5-2 cm thick. Tofu is fairly dense with moisture, and these pieces also contain visible mango bits, suggesting a firm, slightly dense block. A tofu block of this size likely weighs around 40-50 grams per piece. Given there are two pieces present, the total weight is likely between 80-100 grams. Considering the portion is medium-sized and there is no obvious loss or partial visibility, I estimate the total weight of the tofu à la mangue to be about 90 grams."

The image shows two triangular slices of pain au céréales spread with chocolate hazelnut spread. The bread slices are relatively thin and porous, with visible air holes and seeds on the crust, indicative of a light cereal bread. Typically, one entire slice of such bread weighs about 40-50 grams. Each slice here is less than a full rounded slice since these are two halves of a single slice. Considering the dimensions and thickness, each half slice likely weighs around 20-25 grams. Since the entire portion shown corresponds to two halves, the total weight of the bread here is roughly 40-50 grams. Since the question targets a single food item (pain au céréales), and the picture clearly shows two halves that together make one slice, I will estimate the weight of the bread piece visible (combined two halves) as about 45 grams, which is consistent with typical weights for bread slices of this type and size. This estimate excludes the chocolate spread, as it is a separate food item in the list."

The specified food item is 'brioche au chocolat,' and there are two pieces visible. Each brioche appears to be a small individual roll, roughly 7-8 cm in diameter, typical for small bakery brioches. Given the density and size of such bread rolls with chocolate chunks, they usually weigh between 50 and 75 grams each. Since these look slightly compact but not overly large, I estimate each brioche au chocolat to weigh around 65 grams. The estimate is for one piece as requested."

A standard slice of fondant in Switzerland can vary but often weighs between 100 and 150 grams depending on thickness and size. Visually, this slice appears to be medium-sized, about one-eighth of a typical cake, and moderately thick. Given the density and visible size relative to the plate, I estimate the weight to be around 120 grams, fitting within a plausible range of 110-130 grams. This takes into account the density of the cake and the standard slice size."

The target food item is 'boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate'. In the image, there are about nine vegetable meatballs visibly arranged on top and around the pasta. Each meatball is roughly the size of a small walnut, appearing dense and coated with tomato sauce. Typical vegetable meatballs weigh approximately 25-35 grams each depending on size and density. Since these meatballs appear moderately sized and reasonably dense, I estimate around 30 grams per meatball. Multiplying by nine meatballs gives around 270 grams total. Given some may be slightly smaller or larger and considering the sauce adds little weight, a range of 250-290 grams is plausible. This fits well with a main or substantial side portion in Swiss context, complementing the pasta below. Therefore, the best estimation for the total weight of the 'boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate' on this plate is approximately 270 grams."

The image shows four small croissants filled with fresh cheese (croissant au fromage frais) placed on a small plate. These croissants appear to be homemade or smaller than typical bakery croissants, with a less flaky texture and slightly uneven shape. Each croissant is about 8-10 cm long, smaller than a standard croissant which usually weighs around 50-70 grams. Given the size and the stuffing of fresh cheese inside, which adds some weight but is not dense, I estimate each croissant weighs less than a full standard croissant. A reasonable range per croissant would be around 30-40 grams. Considering the visual evidence, I estimate the weight of one croissant au fromage frais to be approximately 35 grams."

The image shows a glass bowl containing a portion of chocolate yogurt. The yogurt is partially scooped out, with visible swirls of different shades of chocolate. The bowl size appears to be small to medium, comparable to a standard dessert or snack bowl. Given the volume and density typical of yogurt, and considering the yogurt is somewhat thick and creamy, the quantity visible is roughly equivalent to a single serving. A standard single-serving yogurt container typically holds around 125 to 150 grams. Since this portion looks slightly less than a full container but still substantial, I estimate the chocolate yogurt weight is approximately 130 grams. The estimated range based on visual cues would be about 110-150 grams, with the final weight towards the middle of that range."

The image shows a single medium-sized apple on a wooden surface. The apple appears fairly typical in size with a slightly squat, round shape and visible stem indentation. It looks fresh and dense. A common medium apple usually weighs between 150 and 200 grams. Given its size relative to the wooden floor planks, which provide some scale, this apple seems average rather than large or small. Therefore, estimating towards the middle to slightly lower end of the medium range is reasonable. I estimate the apple weighs approximately 170 grams."

The target food is 'sandwich jambon,' which is the longer seeded whole grain sandwich on the plate. It includes a visible slice of ham, some lettuce, and a seeded baguette-style bread. The sandwich occupies a substantial portion of a standard-sized dessert plate, indicative of a medium-sized sandwich typical in Swiss contexts. The seeded baguette looks dense and about 15-20 cm long. Bread accounts for most of the volume and weight here, with ham and lettuce providing smaller contributions. A typical ham sandwich of this size with bread, ham slice, and lettuce usually weighs around 150-180 grams. The sandwich seems moderately filled but not overly stuffed, closer to the lower end of that range. The total weight estimate should therefore be around 160 grams. This fits well with Swiss typical sandwiches and the visible proportions compared to the canapé au saumon which is much smaller and lighter."

The cottage cheese aux herbes is visible as a small pile of white curds with herbs on the plate, positioned near the bottom center of the plate. The portion is modest, roughly covering an area of about 3-4 cm in diameter and a small height, consistent with a single serving scoop. Comparing it to the size of the fried egg and the breads on the plate, the curds are a small but dense portion. Typically, cottage cheese servings can range from 100g as a snack portion. This visible quantity is somewhat smaller than a full typical Swiss serving but not negligible. Considering its compactness and density, I estimate the weight of this herb-seasoned cottage cheese portion to be around 70-90 grams. I finalize the estimation at approximately 80 grams, balancing the apparent volume and standard serving guidance."

The poivrons are roasted, cut into strips of various sizes, and placed on one side of the plate. The total portion of roasted red peppers is visually about a small handful, covering a small area compared to the potatoes. Roasted peppers are轻量 and have some water content but also shrink with cooking. Considering the size of the plate and visible portion, the peppers appear to be between a small to medium portion for a side vegetable. Typical side vegetable servings are 120-180g, but the portion appears smaller than a full side serving here. Estimating visually, I would place the poivrons in the range of about 70-100g. Taking into account the roasted shrinkage and density, I estimate the total weight of poivrons to be approximately 85 grams."

The image shows a single whole nectarine placed on a wooden surface. The nectarine appears to be of average size, roughly similar to the size of a small apple or large plum, which fits common nectarine sizes visible in a typical portion. Given the size reference against the pencil tip blurred in the background, the fruit is medium-sized, neither particularly small nor large. Typical nectarines weigh between 120 and 180 grams in Switzerland. Considering this nectarine looks moderately sized and intact with skin, I estimate its weight to be in the mid-range, around 140 grams. This is consistent with common portion sizes and visual evidence."

The target food is ""pain tartiné au pesto,"" which are three small round slices of bread with pesto spread on top. The slices appear to be about the size of typical small bread rounds or baguette slices, roughly 5-6 cm in diameter each. Each slice appears thin and lightly toasted, with a moderate amount of pesto spread. Typical weight for a small slice of bread of this size is about 15-20 grams. Considering the thinness and three slices present, the total bread weight is about 50-60 grams. The pesto spread looks like a thin layer; pesto density is about 0.9-1.0 g/cm3, and the volume spread here might be around 5-7 grams total for the three slices. Combining them, the total weight of the ""pain tartiné au pesto"" is roughly 55-65 grams. Given that the slices are not very thick and the pesto amount is moderate and evenly spread, a good final estimate is near the middle of this range, about 60 grams. This fits the image proportion well relative to the cherry tomatoes on the plate and corresponds to a small snack portion rather than a full appetizer serving."

The image shows a white bowl containing cherry yogurt, which is a creamy and fairly dense food. The yogurt fills less than half of the bowl's volume, and the bowl appears to be a standard medium-sized cereal or soup bowl, which typically can hold about 300 to 400 grams of yogurt if filled near full. Since this portion looks to be about one-third full, and given the creamy but thick consistency of cherry yogurt, the visible amount likely weighs between 100 and 140 grams. Considering the visible volume and texture, a solid final estimate would be on the higher side within this range to avoid underestimation due to thickness and small volume perception. Therefore, I estimate the cherry yogurt weight to be approximately 130 grams."

There appear to be about 15 to 20 chunks of kiwi visible in the bowl, covering roughly half the bowl's surface. A whole medium kiwi typically weighs about 75-85 grams including skin, and the edible portion is slightly less. Considering that the kiwi pieces amount to roughly the equivalent of one medium kiwi fruit, or slightly more, I estimate the total kiwi weight to be in the range of 70 to 90 grams. Given the volume and typical density of fresh kiwi fruit pieces, a solid estimate is about 80 grams."

The target food item is 'sauce,' which is visible spread around and partially covering the plate together with mashed potatoes, meat ragout, and carrots. The sauce forms a thin to moderate layer covering a large part of the plate's surface, pooling around the other components. Considering the sauce's typical density and liquid nature, it generally weighs less per volume than solid foods but in this case looks substantial in volume due to its spread and the plate size. Visually, the sauce amounts to roughly 80-120 ml in volume given its spread and visible depth. Since sauces average about 1g per ml depending on density (and this looks like a standard brown meat gravy), it's reasonable to assume the sauce weight is close to 90-110 grams. Given the visual evidence and plate size, I estimate the sauce weighs about 100 grams."

A typical side portion of cooked meat or fish in Switzerland ranges from 120-180g. This piece appears to be significantly less than a full side serving, more like a small remnant or portion that might weigh about one third of a standard serving. Taking into account its visible size, moisture, and density, I estimate its weight to be approximately 50-60 grams. This estimate aligns with it being a small piece of cooked salmon rather than a full portion."

Each slice is about average size for a typical slice of bread. Standard sliced bread usually weighs between 25 to 35 grams per slice. Here, the two slices combined would be approximately 55 to 70 grams. Considering the visible size and thickness, and that the slices appear quite standard (not very thin nor very thick), the total weight of the bread visible in the image is around 60 grams.

Given the volume and density of each component, the lettuce portion itself is small to medium, considering it is leafy and light. A typical side salad with leafy greens in Swiss portions weighs around 60-100g. The lettuce here is roughly half the bowl's content by volume, with dense components like tomato and apple also present. Estimating the leaf salad weight alone from visual density and volume, I set a plausible range of 40 to 70 grams.

Compared to the size of the carrots and meat pieces, the mashed potatoes constitute a substantial but not overly large portion. Swiss portion sizes for side servings of potato purée generally range from 150 to 220 grams.

The size roughly corresponds to a standard small ball of mozzarella, about 6-7 cm in diameter and between 1.5 to 2 cm thick. Comparing this size to the olives nearby, which are about 3-4 cm long each, confirms a modest, typical mozzarella portion. Fresh mozzarella balls typically weigh around 100g for a medium size. This piece looks neither very small nor extra-large, so I estimate it to be a medium portion. Given the visible quantity and typical density of fresh mozzarella, a reasonable weight range is 90 to 120g. Choosing a value toward the median of this range, the best estimate for the mozzarella's weight is approximately 105 grams. This aligns well with the visual references in the image and is consistent with typical Swiss portion sizes for mozzarella as a side or appetizer."

The item is a container of plain low-fat yogurt (yogourt nature maigre), which is a standard packaged food. The container size looks typical of individual yogurt pots commonly sold in Switzerland and Europe, which generally range between 125g and 150g. The yogurt is nearly full, indicating that no portion has been consumed yet. Given the relative dimensions of the container compared to the visible spoon foil and the surrounding surface, it most likely contains the standard 150g. There are no visual cues suggesting a smaller or larger portion. Therefore, based on typical packaging and visible quantity, the weight of the yogourt nature maigre is estimated to be 150 grams."

The image shows a plate with a portion of spaghetti topped with meat sauce and grated cheese. The spaghetti alone forms a moderate-sized nest in the center of the plate, occupying roughly a quarter of the plate area. The individual strands of pasta are typical spaghetti width and appear cooked, which increases their volume and weight compared to dry spaghetti. Since this is a side/main dish portion, Swiss portion references for cooked pasta range from 180 to 250 grams. Visually, this portion looks smaller than a large main dish but clearly more than a half portion. Taking into account the volume on the plate, the spread of strands, and the presence of sauce and cheese on top, I estimate the cooked spaghetti portion to weigh about 180 grams. This is at the lower end of a full main dish serving but reflects the visible quantity well. This estimate excludes the meat sauce and cheese, as only the spaghetti weight is requested."

The image shows a single slice of rhubarb cake on a plate. The slice is relatively thin and triangular, occupying a moderate portion of the plate. The topping has a visible layer of rhubarb pieces, which are chunky but not very dense or heavy due to their fibrous nature. The cake base looks moderately thick but not dense, likely a light sponge or pastry dough. Compared to typical dessert slices, and considering the volume and visual density of rhubarb and the cake portion, the estimated weight would be less than for richer cakes but more than just the fruit topping alone. Standard slices of fruit-topped cake commonly weigh between 120-180 grams. This slice appears medium-sized, so a reasonable estimated weight range would be 130-160 grams. I select a final weight estimate near the middle of that range at 145 grams."

The image shows five individual duchess potatoes ('pomme de terre duchesse'), each about the size of a small walnut or a large chestnut, with a typical swirled shape and golden-brown exterior. Duchess potatoes are dense but airy mashed potato portions, typically weighing between 20-40 grams each depending on size. Considering these seem closer to the smaller medium size, I estimate around 25 grams per piece. With five pieces, the total weight would be approximately 125 grams. This fits well in the typical side dish weight for potato preparations and matches the portion size visually relative to the breaded fish pieces and the plate size. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the pomme de terre duchesse to be 125 grams."

The image shows a plate with three food items: two fried eggs, a portion of steamed or boiled broccoli florets, and a serving of semolina. The broccoli portion consists of several medium-sized florets clustered together, occupying roughly a quarter of the plate. Broccoli has a relatively high water content but is denser than leafy greens. Swiss typical cooked vegetable side portions range from 120-180g. Comparing the broccoli volume to the eggs and semolina, it appears to be a moderate portion, neither very small nor very large. The florets have some depth and fullness. Given the visual size and density, a reasonable weight estimate is around 140-160g. Considering all this, I estimate the broccoli on the plate to weigh approximately 150 grams."

The image shows four slices of a pizza on a plate. The pizza has visible toppings of mushrooms, black olives, and slices of courgettes (zucchini). The slices are relatively thin with a medium crust thickness that appears slightly crisp but not overly dense. The slices cover a large portion of a typical dinner plate (around 25-28 cm in diameter). A whole pizza of this size typically weighs between 350 and 500 grams depending on toppings and crust thickness. Since there are four slices shown, it suggests a half or a bit less than half pizza is on the plate. The toppings, being mainly vegetables (mushrooms, olives, courgettes) and cheese, would add moderate weight but not excessively dense toppings. The distribution is moderate, not heavily loaded. Given these observations, the weight of the four pizza slices shown is logically between 175 to 250 grams. I'll select a value in the middle range considering the moderate amount of toppings and size. Thus, the estimated weight of the 'pizza champignons, olives, courgettes' portion shown is approximately 210 grams."

The image shows a partially eaten plate with two visible food items: a slice of grilled aubergine and a piece of cooked chicken breast (poulet). The target food is the chicken. The piece of chicken breast visible is moderately thick and approximately 6-7 cm in length, roughly the size of a finger. It is a small portion, likely a single piece cut from a larger breast. Typical side portions of cooked chicken breast in Switzerland are 120-180g, but this piece is clearly smaller than a full side portion. Given its size, shape, and thickness, I estimate this piece to weigh roughly between 50 and 70 grams. Considering visual density and the fact that the piece looks quite substantial, a final estimate around the middle of this range is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the visible chicken piece at approximately 60 grams."

The image shows a single pancake placed on a decorated plate with a small pile of dark chocolate chips ('pépites de chocolat noir') on top. The pancake appears homemade, round, and about the size of a standard breakfast pancake, roughly 10-12 cm in diameter. The thickness seems consistent with a typical pancake, around 1-1.5 cm, not too thin or thick. Comparing the pancake size to the chocolate chips and the plate, the pancake seems medium-sized. A standard medium pancake of this diameter usually weighs between 50 and 70 grams. Since this pancake looks dense but not overly thick or heavy, an estimate towards the middle of that range is appropriate. Therefore, I estimate the pancake weighs about 60 grams."

The image shows a small amount of moka yogurt served in a small dark bowl being held by a hand. The yogurt portion looks like a single scoop or dollop with a volume roughly comparable to about 100 ml or less, considering the typical size of a hand and the bowl. Moka yogurt is dense and creamy, so 100 ml roughly corresponds close to 100 grams in weight. Given the visible portion is about half or less of a standard single-serving yogurt container (usually around 125g), the quantity appears to be small. Taking these observations into account, a reasonable estimated weight range could be 80-110 grams. Picking a midpoint more aligned with the visual portion size and density, I estimate the weight of the yaourt moka to be about 95 grams."

The specified food is 'poulet' (chicken) which appears as two small grilled pieces on the plate. Each piece appears to be roughly 3-4 cm in diameter and about 2-3 cm thick, resembling small chunks or kebab-like portions. Comparing the size to the sliced grilled bell peppers next to it and the plate diameter, the chicken pieces look modest in size and portion. Typically, a 3-4 cm chunk of cooked chicken breast weighs about 40-50 grams. Given there are two pieces, the total weight is likely between 80 to 100 grams. Because the pieces look dense and fully cooked with some seasoning and grilling, I estimate the total weight of the chicken portions to be approximately 90 grams, which fits within typical side dish ranges for meat and visually matches the plate context."

The image shows a small glass bowl with chocolate yogurt scooped inside. The quantity appears to be a modest serving, roughly occupying about one-third to half of a standard small dessert bowl. Given that yogurt is dense but not heavy, the volume looks like approximately 150 ml at most. Based on typical density of yogurt, 1 ml roughly corresponds to 1 gram in weight. The portion is neither very small nor overly large, suggesting a medium-sized portion of around 130-180 grams. Considering the visual volume and the container size, I estimate the weight of this chocolate yogurt served here to be about 150 grams."

The salade (lettuce) portion is visible on the left side of the plate. It consists mainly of crisp leafy lettuce pieces, some of which have dressing on them. The leaves are loose and airy, covering a modest area on the plate but not densely packed. Considering the low density of lettuce and the visible volume, this looks like a side portion rather than a large serving. Swiss reference for leafy salads as side dishes is 60-100g. This portion appears moderate in size, perhaps medium, so I estimate it closer to the mid-to-lower end of that range. The portion seems to be roughly equivalent to a small handful or a few large leaves. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this salade to be approximately 75 grams."

The image shows a plate with a serving of pâtes carbonara topped with a pile of grated gruyère cheese. The pasta portion looks medium-sized, with a variety of pasta shapes covered in creamy sauce and bits of meat (likely bacon or pancetta). The pasta occupies a moderate area on a standard dinner plate, with an estimated thin but decent layer that suggests a medium fullness. Given the Swiss standard for cooked pasta main dishes is between 180-250 grams, and this portion appears to be around average size, I estimate the weight of the pâtes carbonara around 210 grams. The grated gruyère cheese is concentrated in the center of the pasta in a visible heap, which seems to be roughly a dense small handful, likely between 20-30 grams but as the question focuses on the pâtes carbonara itself (usually including the cheese mixed in when served), the cheese portion is a topping and separate from the pasta base. Thus, I estimate the pâtes carbonara portion's weight (excluding extra cheese topping) at 210 grams, considering the pasta, sauce, and meat mixed together. This respects the visible portion size, the creaminess and density of the dish, and typical portion ranges."

The agneau (lamb) is the small piece of meat on the bottom left side of the plate. It is a single small chunk, likely a piece of grilled or roasted lamb sausage or kebab, not a large portion. Comparing it to the chicken pieces nearby and the knife, this piece is quite small, approximately 4-5 cm in length and about 2 cm in diameter. Given its size and density, this piece would likely weigh between 30 and 50 grams. Since it is only one piece and relatively slender, I estimate the weight of the lamb to be around 40 grams. This fits with the context of the other meal components, which include a modest amount of chicken and pita bread, indicating no oversized portions."

The image shows a small plate with a slice of dense whole grain bread topped with a visible layer of white yogurt (yogourt nature) underneath a spread of mirabelle jam. The yogurt layer covers most of the bread slice’s surface and appears to have a thickness of about 3 to 5 millimeters. Considering the typical density and texture of natural yogurt and the size of the bread slice (roughly a small to medium slice, approximately 10 cm by 7 cm), the total amount of yogurt looks modest but sufficient for a single serving on a slice of bread. Swiss portion sizes for yogurt as a side or topping are generally in the 50-80 g range for such usage. Visually, the yogurt here does not appear very thick or overly generous, suggesting a portion close to the lower-middle of this range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the natural yogurt (yogourt nature) to be approximately 60 grams."

The specified food item is 'sauce salade' visible as a small amount of white creamy dressing on and near the cucumber slices at the bottom of the plate. It appears in a moderate dollop but not a large puddle. Considering typical salad dressings and their density (similar to cream or mayonnaise), and judging by the amount covering about 3 cucumber slices, this portion is likely between 20-40 grams. Given the visual size and the thickness of the sauce, I estimate it to be around 30 grams. The sauce is not overflowing or spread thinly, but a moderate serving, consistent with a standard side for a plate containing salads and shrimp."

The image shows two slices of bread (pain) on a white plate. The bread is light brown with a porous texture, typical of a medium-density bread like whole wheat or country bread. The two slices appear to be of standard size, roughly 10-12 cm wide and 7-8 cm tall, with a moderate thickness of about 2 cm. Considering average density and moisture content for this type of bread, a single slice typically weighs between 35 and 50 grams. The slices here do not look unusually thick or thin, but are somewhat dense, and have spread toppings. Since the specified food is ""pain,"" I must estimate the combined weight of both slices if the input does not clarify if it's one slice or both; since the input just says ""pain"" singular, I will estimate one slice. Given the average for one slice and the visual evidence here, I estimate the weight to be about 45 grams per slice. This falls in a plausible range given the bread type and size. The visible thickness and crumb density support this mid-range estimate. I have double-checked against the presence of toppings which are thinly spread and do not affect the bread weight."

The cottage cheese is visible in a small mound on the plate. It appears as a small, dense portion of curds with some moisture. Comparing the size of the cottage cheese portion to the potato salad and leafy greens on the plate, it seems to be a smaller side portion. Cottage cheese is denser than leafy salad but lighter and smaller in volume than potato salad portions. Visually, the portion of cottage cheese looks to be about 2-3 tablespoons in volume, which typically weighs around 50 to 70 grams. Considering the Swiss standard portion sizes and being cautious not to overestimate, I estimate the cottage cheese portion to be about 60 grams, which fits a small to medium side portion."

The target food is the ""fromage de chèvre frais à la figue,"" which is the small round cheese piece at the bottom left of the plate near the baguette. This cheese is fresh goat cheese mixed with fig, appearing as a small, soft, creamy piece wrapped in a thin rind, approximately 3-4 cm in diameter and about 2 cm thick. Considering its size compared to the baguette slice (which weighs roughly 30-40g for that size), this cheese piece is relatively small. Fresh goat cheese is relatively dense. Given the volume and density, I estimate the weight of the ""fromage de chèvre frais à la figue"" to be about 30-40 grams. This fits within typical portion sizes for a single small cheese serving. Therefore, a final estimate of 35 grams is reasonable and plausible here."

The image shows a small bowl containing both gorgonzola cheese and blueberries (myrtilles). The gorgonzola portion is a sizable wedge piece that appears dense and firm. Estimating its size relative to the blueberries and the bowl, the cheese wedge is approximately 4-5 cm in length, 3 cm in width, and about 2-3 cm in thickness. Gorgonzola is dense, so this volume corresponds to a moderate portion. Typical dense blue cheese weighs about 1.1 grams per cubic centimeter. This wedge likely weighs between 50 and 70 grams. Given the thickness and density, a medium portion estimate of about 60 grams is reasonable and fits the visual context without over- or underestimating in comparison to the blueberries and bowl size."

These look like cooked or fried bacon or pork belly strips, somewhat small and thin with a slightly crisp appearance. Each piece seems to be roughly 3-4 cm long and about 1.5-2 cm wide, with moderate thickness. Given that cooked crispy pork belly or lard pieces are dense and fatty, their weight per piece is around 15-20 grams considering the size. Since there are three pieces, the total weight is likely about 45-60 grams. Comparing to the other items on the plate, particularly the two chicken skewers (which appear medium-sized), the lard portion is clearly smaller. The visible amount of lard corresponds more to a side garnish or small portion rather than a main. Based on this reasoning, I estimate the total lard weight to be approximately 50 grams, within a plausible range of 45-60 grams."

The image shows a small portion of crème caramel in a shallow plastic bowl. The crème caramel sits in the middle of the bowl and has a soft, pudding-like consistency. The bowl is held by a hand, which provides a scale reference; the bowl diameter seems to be around 12-14 cm, with the crème caramel occupying only the central portion, about 6-7 cm in diameter, and the layer appears to be about 1-1.5 cm thick. Crème caramel is dense and creamy, so it weighs more than volume alone might suggest. A typical single portion of crème caramel in restaurants or store-bought is usually around 100-150g. Given the relatively small amount shown in this image—less than a full cup volume—I estimate it to be at the low end of this range. Considering size, depth, and density, an estimate between 80 and 110 grams is plausible. I choose a middle value of approximately 95 grams as the best estimate for this visible portion."

The target food is 'asperges' (asparagus), which are clearly visible on top of the plate. There are about 7 whole asparagus spears, medium thickness, cooked but still firm looking. They are spread across the couscous and cauliflower, covering a significant visual portion of the plate. A typical asparagus spear weighs around 20-30 grams fresh, but cooked asparagus often loses some water weight. Given the size of these spears and typical density, each spear likely weighs around 18-22 grams cooked. For 7 spears, that would yield roughly 126-154 grams. The asparagus portion looks fairly generous but not oversized, so a medium estimate within this range is reasonable. Swiss guidelines usually consider cooked vegetables side dishes around 120-180 grams, which fits nicely. Therefore, I estimate the asparagus weight as approximately 140 grams."

The sorbet is served in a small paper cup, filled with a visible amount of dense, smooth sorbet. Considering the cup size relative to the apple, the sorbet portion appears modest but substantial enough to be considered a typical serving of sorbet. A medium single scoop of sorbet often weighs around 80-120 grams. Given the visual evidence—the sorbet is heaped but not overflowing—I estimate the sorbet weight to be slightly above average, around 110 grams. The apple is not included in this estimate as it is a separate item."

Compared to the fries on the left and the plate size, the chicken piece appears to be roughly 8-10 cm long but quite slim and not very thick. Given typical density and size of cooked chicken breast meat, a piece of this visible size is likely to weigh between 40 and 65 grams, as it is smaller than a full typical side dish portion of chicken (120-180g common side range). Since the chicken is only one thin strip with no visible additional pieces, I estimate the portion as small to medium-sized, closer to 50 grams. This aligns with the visual cues and overall plate context with a small accompanying portion of fries. Thus, the estimated weight of the poulet portion is approximately 50 grams."

The image shows a plate with a small portion of gratin pasta mixed with tuna, peas, red bell peppers, and melted cheese on top. The pasta pieces are rigatoni-type and are well coated with cheese and mixed with visible peas and some tuna flakes. The portion is modest, covering a small central area of a standard-sized dinner plate, and is neither heaped nor spreads widely. Given the typical Swiss portion size for cooked pasta (main dish) being 180-250g, and considering this portion is smaller than a full main dish serving and includes added solid ingredients which add some weight (tuna, peas, cheese), I estimate a range between 120 and 160 grams. Accounting for the density of the ingredients and the volume visible, a medium-small portion weighing about 140 grams seems reasonable. This fits the visual evidence showing a partially eaten or modest serving size. Therefore, my final estimate for the gratin pates avec thon, petits pois, poivrons et fromage à gratiner is 140 grams."

The image shows a single whole apple being held in a hand. The apple appears to be of average size relative to the person's hand, roughly fitting comfortably within the palm. Compared to common apple weights in Switzerland, a medium-sized apple generally weighs between 150g and 200g. Given the size visible here—neither particularly small nor large—this apple likely weighs around 170-180 grams. No obvious signs suggest it is unusually heavy or light, so estimating about 175 grams seems reasonable and consistent with the visual evidence and typical apple weight ranges."

Considering the density and moisture content of kiwi, a whole medium-sized kiwi typically weighs around 70-100 grams with skin, so peeled and chunked kiwi in this portion seems like approximately half a medium kiwi. This would suggest a weight around 40-50 grams. Given the size and quantity of pieces, I estimate the total weight of the chopped kiwi to be about 45 grams."

The target food is 'œuf au plat' (fried eggs). In the image, there are two fried eggs clearly visible on the plate. Each egg appears to be a standard size, cooked sunny-side up with visible yolks and some seasoning. A typical large fried egg weighs about 50 grams. Given the eggs' normal appearance and size with no visible excessive oil or loss of volume, each egg likely weighs close to this typical value. Together, the two eggs would weigh approximately 100 grams. This aligns with a medium portion size for two fried eggs. There are no indications that these are unusually small or large eggs. Compared to the other foods on the plate (betterave rouge cuite, sardines, and sauce), the eggs occupy roughly a third of the plate area, which seems consistent with about 100 grams total. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the 'œuf au plat' as 100 grams."

The cheese portions cover most of the slice's inner surface but it's relatively thin and not piled thickly. Each cheese slice appears to be approximately 1-2 mm thick and about 6-7 cm long and 1 cm wide, with roughly 6-7 slices visible in total. Given the density of typical semi-hard Swiss or French cheese (~1 gram per cm3) and the slice size, I estimate each slice weighs around 8-10 grams. Multiplying by 6 slices gives an estimated range of 48-60 grams. Considering slight overlap and possible variance, I place the estimated weight at 55 grams. This is consistent with a modest sandwich cheese portion and visually matches the coverage on the bread slice."

The image shows three asparagus spears placed in a rectangular glass container alongside rice and pieces of chicken with curry sauce. The asparagus spears are moderately thick and appear cooked. Typical asparagus spears weigh approximately 20-30 grams each depending on thickness and length. Given these spears appear medium-sized and there are three of them, a plausible total weight range for the asparagus would be between 60 and 90 grams. Considering their appearance and portion size relative to the container and other foods, a medium portion estimate is about 75 grams. This aligns with the Swiss guideline for vegetable side dish portions (120-180g) but is slightly below that, which is reasonable since this is only asparagus and not mixed vegetables, and the portion is relatively modest."

The image shows a plate with a slice of bread topped with jambon (ham), chopped green onions, and drizzled with a dark balsamic cream ('crème balsamique'). The balsamic cream is visible as a thin but noticeable drizzle over the ham. Given this, the quantity of the 'crème balsamique' appears to be about 1 to 2 tablespoons in volume. Typically, 1 tablespoon of balsamic cream weighs approximately 15 grams. Considering the image shows a modest drizzle, closer to 1 to 1.5 tablespoons, the weight likely ranges from 15 to about 22 grams. Since it is a thin layer rather than a heavy pool, I estimate the weight at around 18 grams. This falls within a plausible range for a single serving drizzle of balsamic cream on an open sandwich."

The image shows two slices of bread on a plate, one with butter and strawberry jam, the other with butter and Nutella. The bread appears to be a dense, artisanal style, likely weighing more than typical sliced sandwich bread. Each slice is moderately thick, roughly rectangular with a crust. A typical artisan slice of this approximate size and thickness can weigh around 40 to 50 grams depending on density. Given these two slices look similar, and since one slice is the target 'pain' (bread), I estimate one slice of bread here weighs about 45 grams. This is a medium portion size for a slightly dense bread slice as shown in the picture. Hence, the estimated weight for 'pain' is 45 grams."

The hummus is piled in several small clumps that appear dense but modest in volume. Given the scale provided by the hand holding the lid, the portion looks to be roughly equivalent to about 3-4 tablespoons of hummus. Typically, 1 tablespoon of hummus weighs about 15 grams. Therefore, this portion likely weighs between 45 and 60 grams. Considering the compactness and slight thickness of the hummus as seen, a reasonable estimate is toward the middle-upper end of this range.

By counting, there are about 8 cherry tomatoes or halves visible, with typical small-to-medium size. A single cherry tomato usually weighs around 15 grams, but since some are halved and sizes vary slightly, an average weight of about 12 grams per tomato is reasonable here. Multiplying by 8 gives about 96 grams. Considering a few tomatoes may be partially obscured or smaller, I estimate the total weight of the cherry tomatoes to be around 90-100 grams. This fits well within expected portion sizes and aligns with the visible volume and relative sizes of other items in the bowl. Therefore, my final estimate for the weight of the tomates cerises is 95 grams."

The bowl is a common breakfast bowl size, and the cereal occupies roughly a third of the bowl's volume, with milk filling the rest. Considering the density of cereal clusters (granola-type) and chocolate chunks, this amount appears to be a moderate breakfast portion rather than a large serving. A typical granola cereal serving is about 40-60g dry, and visually the portion here matches about this size. Given the clusters and milk presence, the weight of cereal itself (not counting milk) looks close to around 50 grams. The milk may mislead some to overestimate volume, but only the cereals are requested for weight. I estimate the weight of the cereals here to be approximately 50 grams."

The image shows a white plate with a slice of bread topped with slices of ham, green onion pieces, and balsamic cream. The oignon (green onion) is cut into small rings scattered on the ham. Given the size of the bread slice (roughly a 10x7 cm slice), the number of green onion pieces is around 10 to 15 small chunks, each weighing very little due to their thinness and low density. Green onion portions are generally light; these pieces would likely total between 10 and 20 grams, considering that green onions are mainly water and very light but the visible amount is more than just a garnish. The portion is a medium amount of chopped green onion on the bread slice. Therefore, estimating around 15 grams is reasonable. This aligns with the Swiss portion for vegetables as a side dish (120-180g) since this is just a small topping and not an entire serving."

The target food is the 'sauce blanche (crème, moutarde)' visible on top of the pork piece. The sauce is creamy and covers the top portion of the meat with a relatively even layer. Considering the size of the pork slice underneath (which looks like a typical cooked pork chop of about 120-150g), the sauce layer is not very thick, but spread over a surface area about the size of the pork slice, approximately 10x8 cm. The sauce seems to be a medium density cream-mustard sauce, likely about the density of a thick cream. The volume of sauce covering the meat seems roughly around 30-50 ml. Given that cream sauces have a density near 1 g/ml, a good estimate for the weight is roughly 35-45 grams. Considering some margin for uneven thickness and slight spread around edges, I estimate the sauce weight at around 40 grams. This fits well with the visible quantity relative to the other portion sizes in the dish, which appear moderate and not oversized."

The 'bout de gruyère' is a single rectangular slice of cheese placed centrally on the plate. It appears to be about 12-13 cm long, roughly 2.5-3 cm wide, and about 1 cm thick. Gruyère cheese is quite dense. A typical slice of this size would weigh around 30-40 grams. The slice is not overly thick but has good density, consistent with a modest portion size on a mixed plate that includes breads, cured meats, vegetables, and fruits. Considering the visual volume compared to the other items, the cheese slice looks like a medium-sized portion. Based on this assessment and the density of Gruyère, a reasonable portion would be around 35 grams. The plausible range is approximately 30-40 grams, with 35 grams as the best estimate."

Considering that honey is dense and usually measured in small spoonfuls for such preparations, the portion shown looks like roughly one tablespoon or slightly less. A standard tablespoon of honey weighs about 21 grams. The honey amount is not spread thin but concentrated in one visible cluster, suggesting close to a full tablespoon quantity rather than just a drizzle. Given the size of the jar and typical serving sizes for honey in a dish like this, the honey weight likely falls between 15 to 25 grams.

The cake slice is moderately thick, with a dense creamy cheese filling and a pastry crust. The visible volume of the slice corresponds roughly to about one-eighth of a standard round cake (around 20-22 cm diameter). Cheese-based cakes like this are denser and heavier than airy sponge cakes. Based on the thickness, density, and size comparison with the spoon, I estimate the weight of this slice to be in the range of 110-140 grams. Taking a medium value within this range due to moderate thickness, I estimate approximately 125 grams for this slice. This estimate aligns with typical slice sizes of such cheese cakes served in Switzerland."

The total volume of the chopped tomatoes is roughly equivalent to a small handful, occupying a few dense layers over part of the cutting board's surface. Using the garlic clove as a size reference, which is approximately 5-7 grams typically, and comparing the chopped tomatoes against it, I estimate the overall tomato portion to be moderate-sized. Fresh tomatoes have a high water content, so they are not very dense but the volume looks substantial. Swiss typical portion size for tomatoes as a vegetable side or ingredient ranges from 120 to 180 grams, but this appears slightly smaller than a full side portion.

The cheeses are identified as manchego, two types of gruyère, and raclette, but visually they appear as small thin slices, roughly rectangular or trapezoidal in shape. Each slice looks about 4-6 cm long with an average thickness around 3-5 mm. Cheese is dense, so even small slices can be relatively heavy. Given the size and thickness, each slice likely weighs between 10-15 grams. With four slices, the total weight should be approximately 40-60 grams. The portion looks moderate but not large, and the cheeses are cut thinly, so a reasonable estimate is about 50 grams in total.

The caviar d'aubergine is applied as a moderate but not very thick layer, covering most of the surface area of the slice without much piling. Given the spread's moisture content and density, a thin, even layer like this typically weighs around 15-25 grams. The layer doesn't appear overly thick or heaped, and the overall volume of spread on the bread supports a moderate estimate closer to the middle of this range. Considering the visual evidence, I estimate the weight of the caviar d'aubergine to be roughly 20 grams, with a plausible range between 15 and 25 grams to reflect portion variability.

Given that cooked wheat grains such as perle de blé are moderately dense, and this portion covers a substantial area but not overflowing, we can estimate a medium portion size. Typical side dish portions of cooked grains like wheat pearls range broadly but often fall between 100-180 grams.

Considering that dry muesli is light but somewhat dense due to compact clusters, typical portion sizes for a meal are around 40-60 grams. This portion looks to be moderate, neither very small nor large, with a slight heaping. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the muesli nature to be approximately 50 grams, which fits within a 40-60g plausible range and aligns with the visual volume and context."
m4egh2,sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon),98.0,110.0,12.0,0.05103280680437424,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/6b91ac4b-1f0f-4176-bf40-a12a6cd892e2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The sauce aux champignons in the image consists mainly of sliced mushrooms in a creamy sauce with garlic. The sauce is visibly coating the pasta, but there is a distinct portion of mushrooms. The mushrooms are quite substantial in size, roughly 6-8 slices, which are visibly medium-thick and well coated. Mushrooms, when cooked, retain moisture and are fairly dense, but not very heavy. Considering the visible quantity and its distribution mainly on the pasta, the sauce portion looks moderate, not overly large. Swiss side dish vegetable sauces like this typically fall between 80-150 grams. Given the creamy nature and visible volume of both mushrooms and sauce, a medium portion is an appropriate estimate. Therefore, I estimate the sauce aux champignons portion in the bowl to be approximately 110 grams, with a plausible weight range of about 90 to 130 grams to allow for the creamy sauce component and mushroom volume."

The target food item is 'muesli nature' in a metal bowl. The muesli appears dry, scattered over the yogurt, and fills roughly three-quarters of the bowl's surface area with some depth visible. The bowl is medium-sized and placed on a kitchen counter, aiding scale estimation. Muesli is a mix of oats, nuts, seeds, and dried fruits, and its density is moderate. By visual volume, the muesli layer is about 1.5 to 2 cm deep, spread somewhat evenly. Typical serving sizes of muesli range from 30 to 60 grams depending on portion, but this seems a slightly larger portion, possibly for a complete breakfast component. Considering the density and the visible volume, the muesli portion weighs likely between 50 and 70 grams. I estimate a medium-large portion leaning toward 65 grams to best match volume and visual fullness in the bowl without overflowing."

The target food is 'muesli nature', which is displayed in a small separate orange bowl, clearly visible and not mixed with the yogurt. The muesli consists of relatively large clusters and the bowl seems to be moderately filled but not heaped, with a visible volume approximately equivalent to a small cereal bowl of roughly 250 ml capacity. Considering the density of dry muesli clusters, which is relatively light but compact due to oats and nuts, a full small bowl would roughly weigh between 60 and 90 grams. Given that the bowl is filled to about 3/4, a medium-sized portion is likely around 75 grams. This estimation fits well with typical dry muesli portions typically served at breakfast in Switzerland, which are often smaller than large cereal portions. Comparing it to the adjacent yogurt bowl which also appears to contain a similar volume of content, the muesli is consistent with a medium portion. Therefore, the most reasonable estimate for the muesli nature weight is about 75 grams."

The image shows a peeled banana cut in half and placed on a black plate beside oats mixed with chia seeds, chocolate chips, and peanut butter. The banana half is clearly visible and provides a good visual reference. A typical medium banana weighs about 120-150 grams when whole, but this is just half of it, so approximately 60-75 grams. Given the size of the banana relative to the plate and other foods, it looks like a medium banana half. Therefore, the estimated weight of the banana portion visible in the image is about 70 grams, which fits well within expected ranges for half of a medium banana."

The image shows one thin slice (rondelle) of lemon floating on top of a glass of water. Visually, the lemon slice is about 2-3 mm thick and has a typical lemon diameter of around 6-7 cm. Lemon slices are quite light and mostly water, with a low density. Based on common kitchen experience and visual size, a thin lemon slice typically weighs between 5 and 8 grams depending on thickness. This slice appears fairly standard in thickness and size, so an estimate near the middle of this range is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this lemon slice to be approximately 6 grams."

The mozzarella is visible as a single dollop placed on top of the pasta. It appears creamy and spread loosely, roughly the size of a large spoonful. Considering the typical density and size of fresh mozzarella presented in this form, it likely weighs less than a full ball but more than a small spoonful of cream cheese. Compared to the other components on the plate (kidney beans and pasta), the portion of mozzarella looks moderate but not large. Swiss portion sizes for mozzarella can vary but a single medium dollop like this on a plate typically weighs between 50-80 grams. Given the visual size and the creamy texture, I will estimate the mozzarella at about 65 grams, which fits a medium portion between the visible small and large boundaries."

The specified food item is 'sauce oignons', which visually appears as the reddish brown onion sauce placed atop the slices of roast meat ('rôti') on the plate. The sauce is concentrated over the meat, with some extra visible pooling around it on the plate. Given the size of the roast slices (approximately two medium-thick slices) and the visible sauce layer thickness, the sauce likely weighs less than the solid meat portion but still a measurable amount. Considering the density and moisture of an onion-based sauce and comparing it visually with the size of the surrounding food items, the sauce portion looks to be about 30 to 50 grams. The sauce spread is moderate, not overly thick or sparse. Therefore, the estimated weight is 40 grams, which fits well within a plausible range for a single serving of onion sauce accompanying a plate portion of meat."

The image shows an open galette wrap topped with several ingredients, including slices of avocado, shredded carrots, tomato pieces, a slice of ham, grated cheese, and a spread of demi crème acidulée. The avocado portion appears as two medium-thick slices covering about one-fourth of the wrap. Considering an average avocado weighs about 150-200 grams for the whole fruit, and these slices represent roughly one-fourth to one-third of a whole avocado, the visual volume and thickness suggest around 40-60 grams of avocado. Taking into account the density of avocado flesh and the visible size, a medium portion like this fits well within that range."

The sauce crème 15% au safran is visibly mixed partly with the perle de blé and crevettes at the bottom left side of the bowl. Cream-based sauces with 15% fat content generally have a creamy texture but are not very dense. The amount of sauce visible appears to be enough to lightly coat the grains and shrimp but does not fill a large volume on its own. Given the bowl size and the sauce coverage, I estimate the total weight of the saffron cream sauce to be a small but noticeable amount, roughly between 40 to 70 grams. Considering it is not a large quantity but enough to be moist and coat the other food, a mid-range estimate of 55 grams is reasonable and plausible."

The image shows a half apple ('pomme') and a piece of hard cheese ('fromage pâte dure') on a plate. The apple half appears to be a medium size, roughly 7-8cm in diameter, which suggests a full apple would weigh about 150-180g. Since this is half, the apple half should weigh approximately 75-90g. The hard cheese piece is smaller, roughly 5-6cm long and about 2cm thick, with a dense and firm texture typical of hard cheeses. This piece seems like a finger-sized portion, common for tasting or snacking, and likely weighs between 25-35g. Given the visual size and density, I estimate the weight of the hard cheese portion to be about 30 grams. This fits well with the visual context and expected portion sizes for a snack or light accompaniment to fruit."

The image shows a handful of cashew nuts ('noix de cajou') held in an open palm. The cashew nuts are whole and appear reasonably fresh. Typically, each cashew nut weighs around 1.2 to 1.5 grams on average. Counting roughly 15 cashew nuts visible in the hand, and multiplying by an average weight of about 1.3 grams per nut, gives an estimate around 19.5 grams. Taking into account that some nuts might be slightly smaller or larger and the natural variation in sizes, I would estimate a plausible range between 18 and 22 grams. Given the moderate handful size and visible cashews, the estimated weight would be near the center of this range."

The image shows a plate with four distinct food portions: a leafy green salad, broccoli florets, corn kernels (mais), and chickpeas (pois chiches). Focusing on the corn, it appears in a small, concentrated pile on the plate, with kernels spread moderately, not fully covering the plate but occupying a small region. Comparing the corn portion size to the broccoli and chickpeas, it is visibly the smallest among the three sides by volume. Corn kernels are relatively dense but light compared to legumes. Given the portion size, the corn seems to be about a small side portion, not a full serving. Swiss side dish reference size for corn or similar cooked vegetable is roughly 120-180g, but here the portion is noticeably smaller, closer to about one third of a typical side portion. Thus, estimating an internal range of 40 to 60 grams is plausible. Selecting a medium estimate within this range to reflect the visible portion, I settle on approximately 50 grams for the corn. This estimate is consistent with visual density and volume in relation to the other foods on the plate."

The image shows a plate with four food items: two wraps on the upper left, diced tomatoes on the upper right, diced avocado below the tomatoes, and scrambled egg pieces on the lower left. The eggs appear to be from one standard-sized cooked egg that has been scrambled and spread in a modest pile. A typical cooked egg white and yolk together weigh about 50 grams before cooking, and since scrambled eggs lose some moisture in cooking but do not lose significant mass, the visible portion looks consistent with a single egg portion. Given the small, scattered appearance and the plate size relative to other items, I estimate the scrambled egg portion to weigh approximately 47 grams, slightly under a full egg weight to account for some moisture loss and visual spread."

The target food is 'riz' (rice). The rice portion on the plate looks like a moderate serving, mostly white rice with some wild rice mixed in, along with small visible pieces of carrot. The portion takes up about one-third of the plate's area. Comparing the size of the rice portion to the other items—two asparagus spears, a portion of cooked fennel, and a meat portion with mushroom sauce—helps calibrate the size. The rice portion looks typical for a side dish, but not overly large or sparse. Swiss reference for cooked rice side dish ranges from 80g to 200g. Given the volume and apparent density, I estimate this rice portion to be around medium size, approximately 140 grams. This estimate fits within standard Swiss portions and aligns with the visible quantity and plate context."

The image shows a small glass jar containing crème caramel. The jar is only partially filled, with the crème caramel occupying roughly the bottom fifth of the jar's volume. Given the typical small glass jar size used for such desserts, which often hold around 100 to 150 grams when full, and considering this portion is much less than full, the visible quantity likely weighs between 40 to 60 grams. The texture is dense and creamy, so the volume closely relates to the weight. Estimating the portion as a small serving or leftover, I finalize the weight of the crème caramel visible here at approximately 50 grams."
xjvrtk,thon,100.0,110.0,10.0,0.04339524388127061,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/611431d0-f119-4ef8-ad73-bb27c5075c3c,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'thon' (tuna). The image shows a rectangular glass container filled with a couscous salad mixture containing visible chunks of tuna, cucumber, and pumpkin seeds. The tuna is distributed throughout in small to medium-sized flakes and chunks. Considering the size of the container, which appears to be about the size of a typical meal prep dish (around 15x15x6 cm), and the relative distribution of tuna to other ingredients, the tuna portion looks moderate but not dominant. Given that couscous and cucumber make up a large bulk, the tuna proportion likely accounts for about 20-25% of the total visible food volume. The visible tuna chunks suggest a total weight in the range of about 90-130 grams. Considering the moderate density of canned tuna flakes, the best estimate would be toward the middle of this range. The portion does not look overly large or small compared to Swiss side dish averages for fish (120-180g), but as this is mixed with couscous and vegetables, the tuna is likely on the lower end of that. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the tuna to be approximately 110 grams."

The image shows a single broken piece of dark chocolate ('chocolat noir') on a plain background. The piece appears to be thick and of typical chocolate bar density. Given that a full standard dark chocolate bar weighs around 100 grams and is divided into about 10-12 pieces, each piece typically weighs around 8-10 grams. The piece in the image is slightly broken but resembles an average single segment from such a bar. Considering its size and thickness, I estimate the piece weighs approximately 8 grams."

The image shows a single slice of bread with Nutella spread on top. The slice appears to be a small to medium-sized piece of toasted bread, roughly 10-12 cm in length and 5-6 cm in width, appearing somewhat uneven or hand-cut. The Nutella layer looks moderately thick and evenly spread. A typical slice of this size and thickness would weigh around 25-30 grams. Nutella spread on such bread usually weighs about 10-15 grams per moderate layer. Adding these together gives an approximate total weight. Since the question specifically asks for the weight of the entire tartine Nutella (bread plus spread), I will include both components. Considering the visual evidence, I estimate the tartine Nutela weighs about 40 grams in total, with a plausible range of 35-45 grams where 40 grams is a balanced middle value. The crumbs on the plate and overall scale support this moderate size. This is consistent with a smaller portion typical for a snack or a light breakfast."

The image shows a glass jar containing a mixed mixture of yogourt nature, flocons d'avoine, son d'avoine, miel, graine de chia, and purée d'amande. The target food, 'graine de chia', appears as small black seeds dispersed throughout the jar. Visually, the chik seeds are mixed and distributed but do not appear in a very high concentration or large volume compared to other ingredients. Given the typical density and small size of chia seeds, a small volume translates to modest weight. Estimating from the jar size and proportion of chia seeds relative to the total content, the chia seeds likely weigh between 10 and 20 grams. Since the jar seems almost full and the seeds fairly well incorporated, I estimate about 15 grams of chia seeds in this portion. This makes sense considering usual chia added to overnight oats or similar mixtures is typically 10-20 grams per serving."

The target food item is 'pains aux noix', which are two small walnut bread rolls visible on the wooden surface next to a banana used as a size reference. Each pain aux noix is roughly round, about 7-8 cm diameter, and typical for small individual bread rolls in Switzerland. Given their dense texture with walnuts, the density is moderately high, but the size is small. Each bun likely weighs around 60 to 80 grams. Since there are two pains aux noix, the total weight could be around 120 to 160 grams if both are included, but the request is for one pain aux noix. Therefore, estimating one pain aux noix, I consider it a medium-sized roll, likely about 70 grams. This is consistent with typical small bread roll weights and proportional to the banana size."

The image shows a rectangular metal container holding a meal with three main components: grilled aubergine slices, a piece of pork with white sauce on top, and a portion of polenta covered with shredded cheese. The polenta is positioned on the right side and appears to be a dense, creamy mound topped generously with shredded cheese. The portion takes up roughly one-third of the container and forms a compact, thick heap, indicating a moderate serving size. Considering the Swiss standard portion for polenta as a starchy cooked dish would roughly align with 180-250g for a main side, this portion seems medium-sized, neither a small remnant nor overly large. The cheese topping adds volume but will not drastically increase the polenta weight itself. Therefore, estimating the polenta weight (excluding the cheese) at the mid-range of 180-250g makes sense, but slightly closer to 200g given the visual volume. I'll estimate the polenta around 200 grams considering the shape, volume, and companion food items visible."

The bread slices appear to be a standard medium thickness, roughly similar to typical sandwich bread or country-style loaf slices in Switzerland. A standard slice of bread of this type usually weighs between 30-40 grams. Both slices seem of average size for bread, not particularly thick or oversized. Since the request is for the weight of 'pain' (bread), I estimate one slice weight. Each slice looks like it would be around 35 grams. Given that the list includes bread with two different toppings but visually both slices appear similar in size, I will base my estimation on a single average slice of bread. Therefore, the estimated weight for one slice of the bread in this image is approximately 35 grams."

Visually, the peanut butter portion is small but dense, approximately a tablespoon-sized serving. A tablespoon of peanut butter typically weighs around 16 grams. Compared to the other items—the half banana which is about 60-70 grams, and the oatmeal pile which is substantial—the peanut butter portion is clearly a small side serving. Given the visual volume, I estimate the peanut butter weight to be in the range of 15-20 grams. This estimate is consistent with the thickness, spread, and typical density of peanut butter. Therefore, I conclude the purée cacahuète weighs approximately 18 grams."

A typical tablespoon of peanut butter weighs around 15-20 grams. Given the visible quantity and typical density of peanut butter, I estimate the portion on the plate to be around 18 grams, which fits well within a small serving size and looks visually consistent with the amount shown. This estimate is coherent with the overall meal portion visible on the plate, which is mostly oat porridge and banana half. Therefore, 18 grams is a reasonable and plausible estimate for the peanut butter amount."

Considering typical cereal density and the amount visible, this portion looks to be on the smaller side compared to a usual breakfast serving. Standard cereal portions usually range between 30 to 50 grams dry, but given the smaller amount here and partial fullness, I'd estimate the cereal alone weighs around 35-40 grams. Considering the visual volume and typical cereal weight, a final estimate of 37 grams is reasonable and plausible."

The vegetarian steak is round and approximately the size of a standard cooked burger patty, which typically weighs between 100 and 150 grams. Visually, this steak appears to be about 2 cm thick, dense, and covered with a substantial amount of sauce and grated parmesan, which adds small extra weight but is not included in the estimate. Given its density and size, it seems to be a medium-sized serving typical for a side or a light main course in Swiss servings. Considering the visible thickness and diameter, an estimated weight range for this vegetarian steak with onion sauce would be roughly 130-160 grams. I choose a final value of about 145 grams as a balanced estimate that fits the visual evidence and typical portion size for this type of food in Swiss meals."

The image shows uncooked pasta on a cutting board along with chopped tomatoes and a clove of garlic. The pasta consists of wide, flat ribbon noodles piled on the board. The total pile of pasta covers roughly the top half of the board's surface area. Given the typical density and thickness of uncooked pasta, and comparing the size of the garlic clove and tomato pieces as reference, the pasta portion looks like a medium-sized single serving quantity of uncooked pasta. Usually, a cooked portion weighs around 180-250g, but uncooked pasta weighs about half as much by volume. The visible amount corresponds to about 80-110 grams in uncooked form. Considering the quantity and the comparison to the tomatoes and garlic, I estimate the weight of the uncooked pasta to be approximately 100 grams."

The image shows a white plate with several food items, including a small portion of butter ('beurre') placed near the bottom right. The butter portion appears as a small pat, likely sliced from a typical butter block. The size is comparable to a common butter serving pat, roughly the size of a small slice of bread crust. Considering the typical density of butter and the visual volume on the plate, the portion looks to be around a tablespoon or slightly less. A tablespoon of butter typically weighs about 14 grams, but this pat is slightly smaller than a full tablespoon. Given the visual representation and standard butter pat sizes in a Swiss household, I estimate the butter to weigh between 10-15 grams. Taking a middle value within this range for accuracy, I conclude the weight of the butter is approximately 12 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing a mixture of blanc battu (a cultured dairy product similar to buttermilk or quenched cream), oat flakes, chia seeds, and honey. The chia seeds are small black seeds scattered visibly throughout the mixture. They are dispersed and not piled densely. Considering the volume of the mixture and the typical small quantity of chia seeds used in such a preparation, the chia seeds likely weigh significantly less than the entire mixture. Visually, the chia seeds would correspond to a small spoonful or less. A typical serving of chia seeds added to such a bowl ranges between 10 and 20 grams. Given the visible quantity spread evenly and partially mixed through, a weight toward the middle of that range is reasonable. The bowl size and spoon visible in the background show this is a modest personal portion, supporting an estimate not exceeding 20 grams. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the graines de chia in the bowl to be approximately 15 grams."

The image shows two slices of toasted bread, each spread with a layer of butter ('beurre') and honey. The butter is visibly spread but not in thick layers; it appears to be a thin to moderate smear on each slice. Given that a typical thin spread of butter on one slice of toast is about 5-10 grams, and here the butter is spread across two slices, the total amount of butter is likely around 10-15 grams in total. Since the target food item is 'beurre' (butter), it is reasonable to estimate the weight on the plate (or on the toast) as 12 grams approximately, as the butter does not appear to be heavily applied, and the visible quantity aligns with typical home use spreads."

The cookie has a slightly irregular round shape, approximately 7-8 cm in diameter based on the texture of the wooden surface beneath, which resembles a typical table or desk. Cookies of this size with a dense dough and large chocolate pieces typically weigh between 40 and 60 grams. This cookie appears moderately thick and dense rather than thin and crispy. Given these observations and common weights for homemade or bakery-style chocolate chunk cookies, I estimate its weight toward the middle of this range. Therefore, a weight around 50 grams seems the most reasonable estimate."

The image shows a plate with a salad containing lettuce, cherry tomatoes, avocado slices, tuna chunks, and a generous amount of canned corn ('maïs en boîte') on top. The corn kernels are numerous and densely cover about half of the plate's surface. Considering the size of a typical dinner plate (about 25 cm diameter) and the volume of corn piled, the portion looks substantial but not excessive, roughly a single serving amount from a typical 300g canned corn (drained weight). Given that canned corn has a higher density than leafy vegetables and cherry tomatoes but less than meat, and accounting for the volume shown, a reasonable estimate for the corn portion is between 80g and 110g. The pile is moderately thick but not heaped very high, supporting a medium portion size. Thus, I estimate the weight of the canned corn on this plate to be approximately 95 grams."

Molasses is a dense syrup, but the visible layer is quite thin and only covers the surface without pooling. Considering the typical thin spreading of molasses on toasted bread, I estimate the molasses amount to be about 10-15 grams. Given the thin but consistent layer and the size of a standard slice of bread, the molasses weight is likely closer to 12 grams total."

The image shows four slices of bread spread with butter and strawberry jam (confiture fraise). The jam on each slice is spread thinly but covers most of the bread surface. Strawberry jam is fairly dense but spread thinly, so a typical spread on bread slice weighs about 8-12 grams. Considering there are four slices with a similar amount of jam, the total jam weight is roughly 32-48 grams. The portion looks moderate, not overly thick or sparse. Based on visual assessment and typical spread density, I estimate the total confiture fraise weight on the plate to be approximately 40 grams."

The image shows a standard small plastic container of natural yogurt which is a common size in Switzerland, typically around 125 grams. The container is full, confirming it is a full portion of yogurt. Comparing it visually to the apple next to it, which is about average size, the container seems to have the standard dimensions for a single-serving yogurt pot. Given that standard natural yogurt containers usually hold between 120 and 150 grams, and the container appears to be full, I estimate the weight of the yaourt nature to be 125 grams."

The poivron (bell pepper) pieces are visible near the bottom center of the plate. They appear to be sliced red bell peppers, lightly cooked or sautéed. The amount consists of several thin strips scattered in a small cluster. Considering that bell peppers are low-density but the slices are fairly thin and cover a modest area, and comparing to the other items on the plate such as chicken pieces and sliced avocado, this looks like a side portion rather than a full serving. Typical cooked vegetable side dishes range from 120-180g, but this portion is visibly smaller than that range based on the plate size and relative proportions. The poivron slices here are roughly enough to weigh approximately between 40 and 60 grams. Given the moderate amount and slight cooking which may reduce water content, I estimate the poivron weight to be 50 grams."

The salad leaves appear to be a mix of lettuce types, mostly light and crisp leaves, typical of a leafy side salad. The portion is sparse and spread thinly, covering only a small central area of the plate, roughly equivalent to a handful of leaves. Considering that leafy salads are light and low in density, and given the visible quantity which looks to be well under a usual side portion of 60-100g, I estimate the portion to be quite small. The visible leaves look like roughly 20-30 grams, plus a few grams for the sauce, but the sauce quantity is minimal. Thus, I assign a range of 20-30g, with the best estimate around 25g."

The image shows a white plate with four slices of cheese (fromages) of different types—manchego, two gruyères, and raclette—arranged on the left side, and one slice of pain provencales on the right. The pieces of cheese are thin slices of moderate size, likely cut from small blocks. Typically, a thin slice of semi-hard or hard cheese may weigh around 15-20 grams. Considering there are four slices, the total cheese weight would be roughly 60-80 grams. The slice of pain provencales looks like a small, medium-thick artisanal bread slice, about half the size of a typical slice of bread. A regular slice of such bread weighs about 30-40 grams, so half a slice should be around 15-20 grams. Since the target food is 'pain provencales', focusing on the bread slice alone, I estimate its weight at about 18 grams. This estimate aligns visually with the cheese slice sizes and the plate size, without overestimating the weight of the small piece of bread."

The target food is 'salade de pâtes' (pasta salad). In the image, the pasta salad is located on the left side of the plate, beside the piece of bread, the beef skewer, and the merguez sausage. The pasta salad consists of penne pasta mixed with visible ingredients like ham, corn, and herbs, giving it some volume and density. The portion is moderate, roughly covering an area of about 10x6 cm on the plate, piled not very high but with enough thickness to indicate a reasonable volume. Given pasta's typical density and considering that this salad includes additional ingredients, the weight would be greater than plain pasta alone of comparable volume. Swiss portion guidance for pasta as a main dish ranges from 180-250g, but this is clearly a side portion, smaller than a full main portion. The portion here looks closer to a side dish size, roughly half or slightly less than half of a full main portion. Given these factors, the plausible range for this pasta salad portion is around 80-130 grams. Checking against the other foods, the portion size is consistent with the moderate size of the meat and bread pieces. I estimate the weight of the 'salade de pâtes' at approximately 110 grams, balancing volume and density observed."

The image shows one small feuilleté with tomato sauce. The visible portion is approximately a bite-sized pastry, with a puff pastry texture and a light coating of tomato sauce, slightly caramelized at the edges. The size relative to the wood grain background suggests it is a very small individual piece, likely a mini appetizer or snack portion rather than a full savory pastry. Typical puff pastry mini bites with filling weigh around 20-30 grams if average size, but this one appears on the smaller side. Given its volume and density as a pastry with sauce, I estimate a plausible weight range between 12-18 grams for this piece. Settling in the middle of this range for a modest size, I estimate the weight of this feuilleté sauce tomate to be approximately 15 grams."

The bowl is not a deep large bowl but appears to be a standard size. The volume of cereals visible is moderate, not overflowing. Considering the density of typical breakfast cereals and the presence of some fruit pieces, the portion looks like a typical individual serving. Usually, a standard bowl of dry cereals weighs about 30 to 50 grams, but these cereals are already mixed with milk, which adds volume but not mass to the cereal portion itself. Judging from the visible volume and comparing it with the size of a typical bowl and the milk amount present, the cereals portion excluding the milk is likely on the lower side, around 40-50 grams. I estimate the weight of the cereals to be approximately 45 grams."

The ketchup is visible as a smooth, flat dollop of typical sauce on the plate. Its size can be compared with the pommes duchesse next to it, which are small swirled potato servings roughly 5 cm in diameter. The ketchup portion is modest, with a roughly circular shape about 4-5 cm wide and a thin layer about 3-5 mm thick. Ketchup density is close to water (about 1 g/cm3), so volume in milliliters roughly equals weight in grams. Given the visual volume, the ketchup portion appears to be around 15 to 20 ml, which corresponds to 15-20 grams. Considering the conservative visual size and common ketchup serving sizes on a dish of this kind, an estimate near 17 grams is reasonable."

The butter (beurre) appears to be lightly spread underneath the jam and honey on the bread pieces, visible as a thin, slightly glossy layer. Considering the size of the bread pieces (typical small rolls or baguette slices) and the thin butter layer, the total butter amount is quite modest. Butter is dense and heavy compared to jam or honey, but the thin spread visible suggests a small quantity. Each piece likely has about 5 to 7 grams of butter. Overall, the butter across all pieces likely weighs about 12 to 18 grams. Taking a midpoint, I estimate the butter weight to be approximately 15 grams."

The blueberries are fresh and whole with no indication of being dried or shriveled, so the average weight estimate per berry holds. The portion looks moderate, neither too sparse nor piled. Considering slight variations in size among blueberries, a weight range of 15-20 grams is plausible. I estimate the total weight of the blueberries ('myrtilles') to be about 18 grams with good confidence based on the visible quantity and typical berry weight."

The gruyère is represented on the plate by two thin rectangular slices. Each slice appears to be about 10 cm long, 1 cm wide, and roughly 3 mm thick. Gruyère is a dense cheese with a typical density of about 1.1 g/cm³. Estimating the volume of each slice as length x width x thickness: 10 cm x 1 cm x 0.3 cm = 3 cubic cm per slice, so two slices would be about 6 cubic cm total volume. Multiplying by density gives roughly 6.6 grams total. However, considering that these slices might be a bit thicker or that the edges could add some additional volume, and to avoid systematic underestimation, I would adjust upwards slightly. A typical thin slice of gruyère cheese often weighs about 7-8 grams. Therefore, the most reasonable estimate for the two slices combined is about 15 grams, as they appear slightly thicker and longer. This is consistent with the visual comparison to the bread slices and the tomato slices, supporting a modest but not large portion of cheese on the plate."

Visually, it appears to be a moderate-sized wedge, roughly 1/6 to 1/8 of a whole avocado. Considering a typical whole avocado weighs about 200 grams with the skin and pit (edible flesh around 150 grams), this wedge looks to be about one sixth of that. The portion is relatively dense as avocado is a creamy fruit with considerable weight for its size. Comparing it to the other items on the plate, it is neither very large nor scanty, appearing as a medium-sized portion. Therefore, the plausible range is from approximately 25g (small wedge) to 40g (larger wedge). Given the visible thickness and length of this slice, I estimate it to be about 35 grams. This fits the context of the overall meal size and plate composition."

The target food, 'graines de courge' (pumpkin seeds), are visible scattered throughout the couscous mixture in the glass container. Visually, they appear as small dark green seeds dispersed among the couscous, cucumber, and tuna. Given their small size and sparse distribution, it is unlikely that they make up a large portion of the total weight. The container is moderately sized and held in hand, suggesting a total volume of couscous dish around 300-400 grams. Pumpkin seeds are dense but the visible amount looks to be just a light sprinkle rather than densely packed. Estimating the visible seed quantity, it is plausible their weight ranges between 15 to 30 grams. Given the relative quantity visible and typical use of pumpkin seeds as a garnish or small mixed ingredient, I estimate the weight of the pumpkin seeds in this portion to be about 20 grams."

The jam layer is relatively thin and mostly evenly distributed across both slices. Typically, jam spread on toast for breakfast is light, not thick or heaped, suggesting a modest quantity. Each slice is about standard size for sliced bread, roughly 25-30 grams per slice of bread, but we only estimate the jam here. Considering the coverage and thin application, the amount of apricot jam visible is likely between 15 and 25 grams for both slices combined. Since the task is to estimate at least one slice, and both are similar, the apricot jam on one slice is about half that amount, roughly 8-12 grams. Taking a mid-range value for the visible jam on one slice, I estimate approximately 10 grams of apricot jam."

The bowl is a medium size, filled to about three-quarters full. The yogurt is creamy and thick, coating all the ingredients. Typically, such a bowl might contain about 150 to 200 grams of yogurt, considering the volume observed and the fact that cereals and blueberries add to the volume but do not contribute much to the yogurt weight itself. The cereals and blueberries give some volume but the yogurt is the binding liquid. Given the amount visible here, I estimate a medium portion of yogurt approximately 160-190 grams. Choosing a middle to slightly lower edge because the mixture is quite dense, my final estimate is 175 grams for the blood orange yogurt."

The target food is mayonnaise thomy, which is the dollop of creamy white mayonnaise on the plate next to the white asparagus. The portion of mayonnaise is a moderate-sized dollop, roughly the size of a large tablespoon, but not heaped very high. Mayonnaise is dense and heavy for its size, so even a small volume weighs noticeably. Based on the visible size and comparison with the asparagus (which are medium-sized stalks approximately 10-12 cm long), the mayonnaise portion is about 1-1.5 tablespoons in volume, which typically corresponds to roughly 15-20 grams in weight. Considering it is not full heaped, and appears smooth and soft, I estimate between 15 and 18 grams, and choose a final estimate near the middle to be precise. Thus, the mayonnaise thomy weighs approximately 16 grams."

The image shows a small slice of toasted bread with a spread of chestnut cream and some butter on top. The bread slice appears to be about the size of a typical small tartine, roughly 7-8 cm in longest dimension. Considering that a small tartine slice like this usually weighs between 25 and 35 grams. The chestnut cream and butter spread is thin but covers most of the surface, adding roughly 10-15 grams combined, based on typical density and thickness of such spreads. Adding these components together, the total estimated weight of the tartine with cream de marrons and butter is around 35-50 grams. Given the visible coverage and typical product densities, a reasonable estimation is about 42 grams, which fits well within the plausible portion size for a small tartine snack."

The target food item is 'pâte à tartiner au chocolat,' which is visible as a thin, spread layer on a waffle. The spread is unevenly applied across roughly 10 segments of the waffle, with some areas thicker than others but overall a light coating. A typical serving size of chocolate spread on one waffle portion usually ranges around 15 to 30 grams depending on thickness. Considering the thin spread and some gaps visible, it is closer to the lighter side. The plate and waffle size help calibrate: the waffle portion looks standard (approximately 10x10 cm) and is not heavily coated, suggesting a smaller portion. Thus, a reasonable weight estimate falls between 15 and 25 grams, with the best estimate being around 20 grams to reflect the relatively modest spread."

The image shows a slice of 'tresse' bread with strawberry jam ('confiture fraise') spread on top. The slice is partially eaten but still fairly thick and of typical size for a bread slice. The strawberry jam layer is visibly thin and spread unevenly over most of the slice surface. Considering a typical jam spread on a slice of bread is about 10-15 grams for a moderate layer. Given the visible portion and spread coverage, I estimate the strawberry jam weight to be on the lower side, about 10 grams. This is consistent with usual jam spreading practices and the visual amount shown. The jam has a slightly glossy, gel-like texture with small seeds visible, indicating a real jam rather than a jelly or preserve, which matches typical density. Therefore, I conclude that the weight of the confiture fraise in the image is approximately 10 grams."

A medium strawberry generally weighs between 12 to 18 grams depending on size and water content. Given the visual size comparison to the table surface and the usual density of strawberries, I estimate each strawberry here to weigh approximately 15 grams each. Since the task is to estimate the weight of one strawberry, the final estimate for one fraise is about 15 grams."

The image shows two small slices of rustic bread on a plate, each spread with a different topping. The focus is on the amount of butter ('beurre') visible. The butter appears to be thinly spread on both slices, covering about half the surface area of each slice. Given the size of the slices – roughly the size of a small piece of country bread, approximately 7-8 cm in length – the total butter coverage likely corresponds to about 5 grams per slice at most, given the thinness and spread. Both slices combined seem to have about 8-10 grams of butter. Since the question is about estimating the butter weight, I consider the butter spread carefully on two small bread slices. A typical thin butter spread on one slice is around 5 grams; here there is a thin spread on both slices, but not thick at all. Therefore, I estimate the total butter weight on the plate to be approximately 8 grams."

A typical scoop of ice cream in Switzerland usually weighs between 50 to 70 grams, depending on the size. The scoop here appears to be a medium size, roughly spherical and about the size of a standard ice cream scoop used in home or café settings. Comparing it visually to the bowl size, the scoop takes up a moderate portion of the bowl without overflowing. Given this, the estimate should be toward the middle of the usual range, slightly adjusted for the partial melting seen at the base, which might slightly reduce the solid ice cream weight. Therefore, a reasonable estimate would be about 60 grams for the vanilla ice cream scoop."

The slice appears to have a thin to moderate layer of butter, spread evenly but not thickly. A typical thin spread of butter on a bread slice is approximately 5 to 10 grams, depending on coverage and thickness. Considering this is a modest amount on a medium slice of bread and accounting for the visual thinness and partial coverage, an estimate of about 7 grams seems reasonable. This fits within typical butter portion sizes for a spread on bread. The range considered is roughly 5-10 grams, choosing 7 as a balanced final estimate."

The segments appear cleanly peeled and intact, with a natural volume and juiciness. Together, the 3 pieces would be around 60-75 grams. Since the segments do not make up a full orange but probably about half, this is a plausible weight. Swiss portion reference for fruit is about 120-180 grams for a full fruit serving, so this reduced portion visually fits just over a third of this. Considering these observations, I estimate the weight of the orange segments on this plate to be approximately 70 grams."

A typical fried egg from a standard chicken egg weighs about 50 grams in total, including both yolk and white. Visually, the egg appears cooked normally with the yolk and white largely intact and covering a typical area for one fried egg. There is no visible excessive oil or extra egg, so the weight is close to a standard single egg. Using visual scale from the plate (a typical dinner plate of about 27 cm diameter) and comparing the egg size relative to the galette, the egg looks proportionally normal without reduction or increase in volume.

A large fried egg in Switzerland typically weighs about 50-60 grams when cooked, as cooking reduces water content slightly but does not drastically reduce weight. Comparing the egg size to nearby cherry tomatoes and the slice of feta, it confirms the typical scale of the egg.

Such small chocolate figures typically weigh between 25 and 35 grams each, given the density of milk chocolate. Comparing to known Swiss chocolate figurines of similar size, which often weigh around 30 grams, it is reasonable to estimate that each is about 30 grams.

Flax seeds are very small and light; a dense sprinkling over this plate corresponds to a relatively small weight. Considering the visible quantity, it looks like a generous topping, not just a pinch but not a full scoop either. Flax seeds weigh about 0.9 grams per tablespoon (roughly 10 grams per 100ml by volume). The scattered seeds appear to be roughly equivalent to 2 to 3 tablespoons in volume when spread on the tomatoes. This suggests a weight between 5 to 8 grams.

This estimation is also consistent with the visual comparison to the omelette pieces on the plate."

The image shows a bowl partially filled with rice mixed with a yellow curry-like mixture containing vegetables (carrots, green pieces). The rice is visible under the curry layer and appears to be cooked, white rice. The bowl seems to be medium-sized, about the size of a typical cereal bowl. The rice portion occupies roughly half of the bowl's visible volume, with the curry topping covering it but not overly thick. Considering the density of cooked rice and the volume visible in the bowl, the rice portion appears moderate — not too small but not a full large portion either. Swiss side dish reference ranges for cooked rice are 80-200g with typical side servings often around 100-150g. Given the depth of the bowl and visible amount, a reasonable estimate would be toward the middle to upper part of the side dish range. I estimate the rice weight to be approximately 140 grams."
p96w4a,vinaigre balsamique,13.0,15.0,2.0,0.001128276340913036,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/7004d086-abf6-4e9f-a945-0d22f3a60a84,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The vinaigre balsamique is a liquid dressing visible as drizzled dark sauce on top of the salad in a small white bowl. It appears to be a moderate amount used to dress the salad, covering multiple vegetables but not pooling heavily. Considering the small bowl size and typical vinaigrette application, the volume of vinaigre balsamique is likely between 10 and 20 ml. Given that balsamic vinegar has a density close to water, 1 ml corresponds roughly to 1 gram. Therefore, the weight is approximately 15 grams, which fits the visible quantity and typical salad dressing amounts in Swiss serving style. This estimate is consistent with the pouring pattern and the small portion size of salad."

The image shows a white plate with a serving of tagliatelle pasta accompanied by a mushroom cream sauce and a side of gratinated courgettes. The pasta portion appears moderate, spread in a small pile covering less than a quarter of the plate surface. The tagliatelle strands are visibly cooked and moist. Given the typical Swiss main dish cooked pasta portion ranges from 180g to 250g, the visible amount here seems smaller than a full main portion but not an extremely small side. Since there is also a vegetable gratin and sauce on the plate, likely serving as sides, the pasta portion is probably intended as the main carb but is on the smaller side. I estimate the pasta portion to be about 130-150g based on volume, thickness, and visible quantity. Considering this is a well-contained serving that looks about half to two-thirds of a standard main portion, I settle on approximately 140 grams for the pasta weight."

The image shows a small bowl containing a few olives and tomatoes cerises (cherry tomatoes). The target food item is 'olives'. There are 4 olives visible, each of typical size for black olives, approximately 2-3 cm in length. A single olive usually weighs about 4-5 grams depending on size and variety. Considering the 4 whole olives, the total weight is likely around 16-20 grams. The olives look fresh and whole, no visible cut or missing piece, so no significant correction is necessary. This is a small serving portion, consistent with a side or garnish rather than a main ingredient. Hence, I estimate the portion weight of the olives to be about 18 grams, within a plausible range of 16-20 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing three main components: quinoa, asparagus, and a piece of salmon. The quinoa occupies roughly half of the bowl and appears well-cooked, with the grain volume loosely piled but relatively dense. Given the bowl size compared to typical hand-sized portions, the quinoa portion seems substantial. Cooked quinoa generally weighs about 185-200 grams per cup; visually, this pile looks close to one cup, perhaps slightly less due to some space between grains and the bowl's curvature. Considering the density and volume, an estimate between 130 and 170 grams for the quinoa seems reasonable, with a medium portion around 150 grams being a good estimate. This fits well within Swiss portion guidelines for a grain-based side or main component and matches visual observations in comparison to the asparagus and salmon pieces present. Therefore, the estimated weight of the quinoa is 150 grams."

The image shows a single apple (pomme) held in a person's hand, which provides a clear size reference. The apple is relatively small to medium in size, with a typical round shape and some color variation. A standard medium apple usually weighs between 150 to 200 grams. Given the apple's size compared to the fingers and palm, it appears to be a bit smaller than average medium size but not extremely small. Therefore, estimating the apple's weight around 140 to 160 grams is reasonable. Considering the visible size and density, I estimate the apple weighs approximately 150 grams."

The image shows two slices of toasted bread with a visible spread of fromage frais on both. A standard slice of toast bread typically weighs around 25-30 grams. The bread here seems to be whole grain and of average size, with both slices roughly complete. Thus, the total toast weight would be around 50-60 grams for the two slices combined. Since the target food is 'toast' (bread), the weight estimate should include only the bread, excluding the fromage frais spread. Therefore, estimating each slice around 27 grams, the total toast weight is approximately 54 grams. This fits with common Swiss portions for two small slices of toast. There is no visible reduction or partial slices that would justify lowering this estimate."

The image shows two slices of rustic bread on a white plate, each with visible spreads. The slice on top has melted butter with a shiny, amber-colored layer of molasses (mélasse) on it. The molasses spread is thin but covers a good surface area of the slice, approximately 8-10 cm². Molasses is dense and sticky, but given the thin spreading, the volume and thus the weight will be moderate. Typically, 1 teaspoon (about 5 ml) of molasses weighs roughly 7 to 8 grams. The visible spread here looks slightly less than a teaspoon, maybe around 0.7 teaspoon visually, considering the thin layer and coverage. This suggests a weight in the range of about 5 to 6 grams for the molasses. Given that the molasses is not heaped but spread modestly, estimating 5.5 grams is reasonable. The bread and butter weight is excluded as requested."

The image shows a small plastic container with what appears to be a single serving of yaourt moka (coffee-flavored yogurt). This type of yogurt commonly comes in standard portions in Switzerland, typically around 125 grams per container. The yogurt is almost full to the top, indicating it is an entire portion rather than a partial serving. The container size relative to the table and nearby paper documents also supports this typical single-serve yogurt cup size. Based on this visual and contextual evidence, the estimated weight of the yaourt moka is approximately 125 grams."

The image shows a white plate with a pita sandwich containing visible lettuce, but the mustard (moutarde) is not visibly separate as a quantity; it is presumably spread inside the pita. Mustard is a condiment usually added in small amounts, often spread thinly inside sandwiches. From visual evidence, the mustard is not present as dollops or in a container but likely just a thin layer inside the pita. Typical mustard serving in such sandwiches ranges from 5g to 10g depending on spread. Given the size of the pita (medium) and usual condiment application, the mustard weight should be on the lower side but not negligible. Therefore, estimating around 7 grams is plausible to account for a typical thin spread inside a sandwich of this size."

The image shows a small piece of bread ('pain') spread with a layer of crème de marrons (chestnut cream). The bread piece is irregular in shape and fairly thin, approximately the size of a hand's small section or less. The crème de marrons is generously but thinly spread, covering the bread surface. Considering the size, the bread piece likely weighs around 15-20 grams. The crème de marrons layer appears medium thickness but spread thin over this portion, so it could weigh around 10-15 grams. Typical jars of chestnut cream are dense but spreadable. Combining these factors, the crème de marrons weight on this piece is small but noticeable. A reasonable estimate for the crème de marrons here is between 10 and 15 grams, leaning towards 13 grams as a medium portion. This estimate matches the visible coverage and typical density, and it aligns well with the overall visual size and portion context."

The image shows one galette wrap laid flat on a plate, spread with demi crème acidulée and topped with several ingredients. The wrap appears to be a standard size, roughly the diameter of a typical medium plate. Galette wraps are thin and light but fairly wide, typically weighing between 50 and 70 grams. Given the consistent thinness and size of this wrap, and no indication it is a thicker or specially large wrap, a standard galette wrap weighing about 65 grams is a solid estimate. This is supported by common packaging information for such wraps and visual confirmation that it is a whole, intact wrap."

The image shows two sandwiches containing clearly visible grilled chicken pieces along with lettuce and curry mayonnaise sauce. The target food item is the 'sauce curry avec mayonnaise,' visible as a yellow spread inside the sandwiches. The sauce is not overly thick but well spread on both sandwich halves. Given the sandwich size (regular baguette pieces) and typical sauce application, the amount of sauce seems moderate, likely around 1 to 1.5 tablespoons per sandwich. Considering the density and typical weight of curry mayonnaise sauce, each sandwich likely contains about 15 to 20 grams of sauce, making a total of around 30 to 40 grams for both sandwiches. Since the query is just for the sauce inside one sandwich, a reasonable estimate is about 15 to 20 grams. This range aligns with typical condiment quantities for sandwiches of this type. To be precise, I estimate the weight of 'sauce curry avec mayonnaise' per sandwich at about 18 grams."

The image shows a plate with three distinct parts: on the left, a portion of cooked pasta; in the middle, a dollop of crème fraîche; and on the right, a chili mixture containing visible chunks of cervelas sausage and kidney beans. The specified food item is 'cervelas,' which are the chunky pieces of sausage visible scattered throughout the chili. The sausage pieces appear to be relatively large and numerous, integrated within the chili portion. Considering that the total chili portion looks like a typical side dish size between 150g and 220g, and given the chili is roughly half sauce and beans and half sausage chunks by volume, the cervelas are likely about 40-70% of the chili mass. Typically, in such a chili, the meat makes a significant proportion but beans and sauce also add weight. Given this, I'd estimate the cervelas to be roughly 100-140g. Because the visual chunk sizes are substantial and the chili portion fairly generous, I lean towards an estimate closer to the upper part of this range, approximately 130 grams. This aligns with typical Swiss portions for meat side dishes and the visible quantity on the plate."

The image shows a single cup of 'yogourt figue sans sucre' (unsweetened fig yogurt) from Migros Bio. The yogurt container is a typical retail size for individual yogurts, which are often standardized. The container appears almost full or only slightly consumed. Such yogurt cups usually come in portions of around 150 grams, commonly found in Swiss supermarkets. Considering this is a commercial packaged product and the container size matches standard single-serve yogurts, I estimate the yogurt's weight to be about 150 grams. Given the fullness, this weight estimation corresponds well to what is visible."
