xjvrtk,courgette et oignons,300.0,135.0,165.0,5.276060541462375,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item to estimate is 'courgette et oignons'. In the image, this is the portion on the left side of the glass container. The courgette and onions are cut into small pieces, cooked, and appear moist with visible herbs and seasoning. The portion occupies nearly half the container in surface area and has visible depth, filling approximately 80% of that half of the container's height. The container is a small square, roughly estimated at 12 cm by 12 cm in area, based on the size of the surrounding wood grain and typical container size. Depth of the vegetable mix is estimated around 3 cm given volume and glass container thickness. The courgette and onions are cooked vegetables, dense despite being cut into pieces. Considering the visible volume and density, I estimate the weight to be in the range of 120-150 grams, leaning toward 135 grams as a balanced estimate accounting for the visible volume and cooked vegetable density. There is no hidden layer beneath, and the mix is homogeneous with pieces consistent throughout the side of the container. Therefore, the estimated weight of 'courgette et oignons' is 135 grams."
2ahgvr,salade grecque,315.0,185.0,130.0,4.364740993391601,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/c476a6d0-acb2-45fd-b168-84822bc98003,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a clear plastic container partially filled with a Greek salad (salade grecque). The salad consists of diced vegetables: cucumber, tomato, yellow pepper, green bell pepper, slices of ring-like onions, some black olives, and small pieces of white cheese likely to be feta. The pieces are small, roughly cubed, about 1-1.5 cm each. The container appears to be about 10 cm wide, 7 cm deep, and the salad fills approximately 40% of the container height, indicating a salad depth of about 3-4 cm. The visible volume of salad is roughly 10 cm x 7 cm x 3.5 cm = 245 cm³. Since the salad is a mixture of water-rich vegetables and cheese, the density is moderate, around 0.9 g/cm³. Considering the small size of pieces and some air space between them, the effective density may be slightly lower, about 0.85 g/cm³. Multiplying volume by density, 245 cm³ x 0.85 g/cm³ = about 208 grams. Given the salad only partially fills the container and the irregular shapes, I reduce by about 10% for empty space, estimating roughly 185 grams. Therefore, the weight estimate for the Greek salad portion visible is about 185 grams."
2ahgvr,porridge salé,48.0,165.0,117.0,0.5985930505222767,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a35f3211-3b33-4826-97b8-3af69655dada,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small glass jar with a metal lid, containing a porridge salé (savory porridge). The jar diameter is approximately 70 mm as indicated on the lid edge, providing a reliable reference for size. The porridge fills the jar up to about 85% of its height, visible from the top of the porridge compared to the jar rim. The jar height appears slightly greater than its diameter, estimated around 80 mm. This suggests a volume close to a small jar roughly cylindrical in shape. The porridge is dense and creamy with visible oats blended in liquid, typical of cooked porridge texture which is dense. Considering the small jar size, the fill level, and typical density of cooked oats-based porridge, this serving likely weighs between 150 and 180 grams. Being conservative and correcting for jar thickness and liquid density, a good estimate is 165 grams."
p96w4a,délice tomate mozzarella,54.0,170.0,116.0,0.6676614794286932,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/5ebafbd6-315d-44a6-8508-ba143d23adb2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'délice tomate mozzarella,' which is visually identifiable on the left side of the plate. It consists of alternating slices of fresh tomato and mozzarella cheese, with seven visible slices of tomato and seven corresponding slices of mozzarella layered vertically. Each slice appears to be about half a centimeter thick, and the length of the entire stack is roughly 15 cm. The slices are laid flat, showing thickness and volume clearly without apparent hidden layers or mixing. Comparing the size of the slices to the plate (~27 cm diameter) supports these dimensions. Tomatoes are relatively lighter and less dense compared to mozzarella, which is denser and more compact. Each tomato slice likely weighs around 10 grams, so 7 slices total approximately 70 grams. Each mozzarella slice is slightly thicker and denser, estimated around 15 grams; 7 slices total about 105 grams. Adding these gives a rough range of 175 grams. Considering minor moisture loss and balsamic drizzle (negligible in weight), and avoiding overestimation for thin slices, a conservative estimate would be around 170 grams total for the 'délice tomate mozzarella.'"
p8a2w5,"dalh de lentilles corail (lentilles corail, oignon, carottes, tomates concassées, 1cs huilde d'olive, épices)",271.0,375.0,104.0,3.004050309102537,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/82b53493-1c97-472b-9ec6-8cc698b8cfe4,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a bowl divided roughly equally between white rice on the left and the dalh de lentilles corail on the right. The dalh appears as a thick, stew-like mixture containing coral lentils, visible sliced carrots, onion pieces, and tomato sauce. The dalh layer occupies about half the bowl's horizontal surface, with a visible depth close to the rim of the bowl, suggesting it fills roughly half the bowl's volume on its side. Comparing to the spoon, which is a standard size and assumes about 18 cm length, the bowl has an approximate diameter of 14-16 cm and depth about 5-6 cm. The dalh fills around half the bowl’s volume, so approximately 350-400 ml estimate for its volume seems reasonable. Dalh is dense due to lentils and vegetables cooked down into a thick stew, so its density is moderately high, roughly around 1 g/ml considering the moisture content. Taking the volume and density into account, the dalh weight is estimated between 350-400 grams. Considering the visible ingredients and consistency, I estimate the weight of the dalh de lentilles corail in the bowl to be approximately 375 grams."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,320.0,97.0,4.311340865487103,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate filled with sliced tomatoes as the main visible component of the salade de tomates. The slices are roughly medium thickness, with some varying slightly in size. There are approximately 15 slices on the plate, arranged in a loose pile. The plate itself is a standard dinner plate, approximately 25-27 cm in diameter, providing reference for tomato slice size. Each tomato slice appears to be about 5-6 cm in diameter and roughly 1 cm thick. The tomatoes appear fresh and ripe, which means an average density typical for tomatoes, close to 0.95 g/cm3. The volume per slice is estimated as roughly a semi-cylinder segment, approximated at about 20-25 grams each. Multiplying by about 15 slices gives roughly 300-375 grams total. However, given the visible empty spaces and some overlap as well as dressing (vinaigre balsamique and visible flax seeds), the actual fresh tomato weight seems closer to the mid-to-lower end of this range to avoid overestimation. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the tomatoes in this salade de tomates as approximately 320 grams."

The ratatouille is located at the top right portion of the plate. Visually, it consists of chunked vegetables that are cooked and combined in a dense, saucy mixture. The portion size is roughly a mound about 7 cm wide, 5 cm deep across the plate, and approximate thickness about 2-3 cm, accounting also for some volume hidden behind visible pieces. Comparing to the fried egg and bulgur on the plate, the ratatouille portion looks moderate but dense, with a moist texture. Given typical density of cooked vegetable stews and the visible quantity, I estimate the ratatouille weighs between 90 and 110 grams. I choose a final estimate near the middle of this range, specifically 100 grams, as it fits the visual volume and density well without over- or underestimating based on the observed dimensions and volume on the plate."
wrah5h,"délice des dieux (biscuit, fruits rouges, séré+mascarpone)",205.0,115.0,90.0,1.9665316563632487,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/5de398c7-684b-448d-ba0a-f318d009bccd,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is 'délice des dieux,' which consists of a biscuit base, red fruits, and a creamy layer of séré and mascarpone. The image shows a single rectangular slice on a plate. There are four visible whole fruits on top: two raspberries and two blueberries, plus more red fruits embedded in the biscuit base. The top cream layer looks thick and smooth, covering the entire slice. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The slice is roughly rectangular, approximately 8 cm long and 6 cm wide based on relative size to the plate, which is a small dessert plate (about 18 cm diameter). The thickness of the slice can be visually estimated around 2.5 to 3 cm, considering the visible height of the biscuit and cream layers. Step 3: Density Considerations - The biscuit base is soaked or moist with fruit juices, increasing density slightly compared to a dry biscuit. The cream layer is dense due to mascarpone and séré, but soft. The red fruits (raspberries and blueberries) are light but add some volume and weight. Given these densities, the overall dish is moderately dense. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Considering the visual estimate of volume (8 cm x 6 cm x 2.5 cm = 120 cm3 approx), and density roughly similar to a creamy cake (around 0.9-1.0 g/cm3), the weight is close to 110-120 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The dessert slice here is a reasonable single serving size, and the estimate aligns with typical weight ranges of similar creamy layered petits gateaux. The amount of fruit is small but significant. Step 6: Final Error-Prevention Check - The weight is under 200 grams as expected for this portion size, no overestimation of thin items as the cream layer is moderately thick, and the biscuit base contributes to weight. The estimate is visually grounded and conservative. Final estimate: 115 grams."
xjvrtk,tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe,250.0,160.0,90.0,2.3982093370283524,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/f607625b-a07d-423e-a564-4d96ebadf084,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows one large triangular slice of tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe on a medium-sized ceramic plate. The slice appears to be about 15 cm wide at the crust and roughly 15 cm long. The crust edge is thin, about 0.5 cm thick and the topping layer with diced rhubarb and apple pieces appears spread evenly across the surface. The rhubarb and apple pieces are diced into small cubes, each roughly 1-1.5 cm in size, covering nearly the entire flat surface. The topping thickness seems quite thin, approximately 1 cm or less in depth. The tarte flambée crust is known to be thin and crispy, so the bulk of weight comes from the topping, which includes fruit and a creamy base. Given the thin crust and low thickness of fruit topping, and the moderate density of cooked rhubarb and apple, the total portion is visually estimated to weigh between 140 g and 180 g. Considering the plate size and slice dimensions relative to typical tarte flambée portions, a final conservative estimate for the weight of this slice is 160 grams."

I focus on the 'boulgour' in the image. The bulgur occupies roughly a third of a rectangular glass container, which appears to be about 15 cm by 15 cm in size with an estimated depth of around 3-4 cm for the bulgur portion. Visually, the bulgur is loosely packed grains with a typical cooked density slightly less than cooked rice but denser than some vegetables. The volume appears to be approximately 250-300 cm³. Given that cooked bulgur weighs about 0.9 g/cm³, this portion seems to weigh around 225-270 grams. Considering some air space between grains and slight compression by the container, I conservatively estimate the bulgur weight to be about 250 grams, as this matches the observed portion size and density."
wrah5h,porc,52.0,130.0,78.0,0.4323172031549776,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/f727ac79-973e-4b92-8f2b-cda94222d4a7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'porc.' In the image, the porc piece is located on the left side of the container, partially covered by a white sauce. It appears as a solid piece of cooked pork, roughly rectangular, about 6-7 cm long, 4-5 cm wide, and approximately 1.5-2 cm thick. The meat looks dense and firm, typical for cooked pork. The sauce on top covers it thinly but does not add weight. Comparing it to the container size (standard lunchbox metal compartment) and surrounding foods (aubergine slices and polenta with cheese), the pork piece is clearly larger than a typical slice of grilled aubergine and slightly smaller than a palm-sized cut. Considering the density of cooked pork (dense meat), the weight for such a piece would usually range around 100-150g. Given the visible dimensions and density, I estimate the pork piece to weigh approximately 130 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread ('pain') on a white plate. Each slice has a spread on top—one with red jam and butter, the other with Nutella and butter. The slices are visibly thicker than a standard thin sandwich bread, appearing more like a rustic or home-baked loaf with a crumb structure visible on the cut side. Both slices have a similar thickness of approximately 2.5 cm, and the size roughly corresponds to about 10 cm in width and 12 cm in length per slice. Considering the bread's airy texture but substantial thickness, each slice is likely around 50 grams. There are two slices on the plate, so total bread weight is approximately 100 grams. However, since the target is 'pain' without specifying the number of slices, I will estimate the weight for both slices of bread present. The spreads do not add to the bread weight. Therefore, the total weight of 'pain' in the image is about 100 grams."

The image shows four pieces of sweet potato waffle ('gaufre à la patate douce') on a plate. Each piece is a quarter of a whole rectangular waffle, with visible grid indentations characteristic of waffles. The pieces appear moderately thick, estimated about 2.5 cm at their thickest part, with a rough rectangular shape about 6 cm by 6 cm per piece. The texture appears dense but not overly heavy, typical of a sweet potato based waffle, likely denser than a normal wheat waffle but less dense than a meat or cheese item. Each piece has some topping of sour cream sauce and smoked salmon, but those are not included in the weight estimate as per instructions (only the specified food item). Considering four pieces total, the total volume resembles a moderate waffle serving. I estimate each quarter piece to weigh about 40 grams, factoring thickness and density typical of such a waffle. Multiplying by four pieces, the total weight of the sweet potato waffle portions is approximately 160 grams. This aligns with typical serving sizes visible here and the thickness and density observed in the image."

The target food item is 'purée de pdt' (mashed potatoes). Visually, the mashed potatoes form a roughly rectangular spread on the plate, placed beneath the stew with meat, carrots, and sauce. The mashed potatoes cover an area approximately 12 cm long and 8 cm wide, and have a visible depth of about 2 cm, judging by the slight height difference compared to the plate surface. Since mashed potatoes are somewhat dense but airy, I estimate a density close to 0.8 g/cm³. Estimating volume: 12 cm × 8 cm × 2 cm = 192 cm³. Multiplying by density: 192 × 0.8 = about 154 grams. Considering some spreading that is thinner at edges and irregular shape, I apply a slight reduction. Final conservative estimate is around 140 grams of mashed potatoes on the plate. This fits with the visual scale relative to the plate and the thickness visible, without including sauce or other items."

The image shows a plate containing several food items, including a brochette de boeuf (beef skewer). The beef skewer consists of three chunks of grilled beef threaded on a wooden stick. Each chunk appears to be roughly cubic with dimensions approximated visually as about 4 cm by 4 cm by 3.5 cm thick. The pieces are dense, indicating solid beef without much visible fat or empty space inside. Compared to the bread slice and sausage on the plate, the size is moderate but not large. Each chunk likely weighs approximately 50 grams given its volume and meat density. Multiplying by three pieces gives about 150 grams total. Considering the visual evidence and comparing to the other items on the plate, a small margin for size variation leads me to a conservative estimate of around 150 grams for this brochette de boeuf."

The image shows a white plate with a serving of pâtes carbonara placed in the center. The pasta includes penne and conchiglie, coated in a creamy sauce with visible small pieces of bacon or pancetta mixed in. On top of the pasta is a noticeable mound of grated gruyère cheese. The pasta portion covers roughly a quarter of the plate with some space around it. Using the plate diameter as a reference (typically around 25-27 cm), the pasta pile is about 12 cm across and moderately thick, with some depth visible especially in the center beneath the cheese. The creamy sauce implies some moisture but the pasta still appears dense and compact, not dry. The bacon pieces add to the density but are minor in quantity. The grated cheese on top looks like roughly 1-2 tablespoons, assuming a light but steady heap, corresponding visually to about 15-20 grams of grated gruyère. For the pasta with sauce and bacon, the volume and density suggest a portion weight around 150-180 grams. Considering the cheese separately and adding 15 grams (typical density for grated cheese), the total weight of the 'pâtes carbonara' including the cheese on top is approximately 165 grams. Since the target is 'pâtes carbonara' (which likely includes the cheese as they are presented together), I finalize the estimate as 165 grams based on actual visible volume, density, and typical portion size seen here."

The image shows a plate with a small mixed salad of diced cucumbers and tomatoes. For the target food item 'tomates', I see approximately 7 individual pieces of tomato, each cut irregularly but roughly similar in size. The pieces appear to be chopped segments from a medium tomato, with an estimated thickness of about 1 to 1.5 cm per piece. The tomato pieces occupy a modest volume on the plate, partly overlapping but mostly in a single visible layer. Considering the tomato density, which includes skin and juicy flesh, the average weight per piece can be estimated around 15-18 grams. Multiplying by 7 pieces gives roughly 105-126 grams. Given the visible quantity and some shrinkage from cutting, I select a moderate estimate of 115 grams for the tomatoes in this portion."

The image shows a small green bowl with four strawberries inside. Each strawberry is whole, not sliced, and appears quite large compared to the bowl's diameter. The strawberries vary in size but are generally sizable, with average length estimated around 5-6 cm and thickness about 3-4 cm. Given the bowl's size, which is roughly the size of a small dessert bowl (around 12-14 cm diameter), the strawberries fill the bowl to about half its depth. Strawberries are fairly dense fruits, typically weighing about 15-25 grams each when of this size. Based on visual inspection and accounting for size variations among the four strawberries, I estimate the total weight to be around 80 grams for all four strawberries combined."

I count 13 individual pieces, most of which have visible thickness between about 1.5 to 2.5 cm, and an average size around 4 cm in length and 3 cm in width. The pineapple pieces appear juicy and dense, with typical texture for fresh pineapple. Comparing the pieces to the plate size and the near visible jar lid in the background, the pieces seem moderately sized chunks rather than thin slices. Pineapple density is moderate, so each chunk likely weighs between 15-25 grams. Assuming an average of about 20 grams per chunk and 13 chunks total, the estimated weight is roughly 260 grams. Given the visual evidence, I conservatively estimate the total pineapple weight to be 260 grams."

The target food item is 'poivrons jaune' (yellow peppers). In the image, the yellow pepper is clearly identifiable as one whole pepper that has been cut into three pieces: one larger pepper body stuffed with quinoa and bulgur, and two smaller slices placed on the plate. The pepper pieces show some translucency and signs of roasting or cooking, with slight shrinkage visible along the edges. The largest piece (the main pepper part) has a rounded shape about as wide as a medium-sized bell pepper about 7-8 cm in diameter and approximately 6 cm high. The two smaller slices each appear roughly 1/4 of the pepper’s original volume. The thickness of the pepper flesh is visible and estimated at about 4-5 mm, indicating a typical bell pepper density. Given that peppers have a density roughly around 0.9 g/cm³ due to their watery, fleshy nature, and accounting for the visible shrinkage due to cooking, the total weight of the pepper pieces combined is roughly the equivalent of a medium yellow bell pepper cut into parts. A medium raw yellow bell pepper weighs about 150 grams, but since this is roasted and partially hollowed out to be stuffed, it likely weighs somewhat less. The filling (quinoa and bulgur) is not to be included in the weight. Hence, considering the pepper flesh alone and the visible shrinkage, I estimate the weight of the yellow pepper pieces present on the plate combines to approximately 90 grams."
ppf8hc,crème caramel,115.0,55.0,60.0,0.7354508633553614,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/7ba1f50a-fb62-4e65-89ea-a193ab96c0db,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small amount of crème caramel in a shallow, transparent blue bowl held in one hand. The crème caramel appears as a creamy, custard-like dessert mass, slightly lumpy in texture. Its surface diameter is roughly 6-7 cm, and the depth is shallow, estimated around 1.5-2 cm based on the visible profile and how it sits in the bowl. The bowl is held close to a human hand and knee, which serve as reference for size scale. The amount of crème caramel visually occupies only the bottom center of the bowl, and the texture looks dense yet creamy. Given these observations, this is a small serving, likely less than a typical portion served in standard dishes. Considering the density of custard-like desserts and the visible volume, I estimate the weight of the crème caramel to be in the range of 50-60 grams. This is a conservative estimate based fully on visual evidence without assumptions about portion norms."
p8a2w5,yogourt industriel à l'abricot avec morceaux,171.0,112.0,59.0,1.075357066723513,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/e4f800da-c429-4a04-823c-ac3792f64c00,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food is 'yogourt industriel à l'abricot avec morceaux,' which is industrial apricot yogurt with pieces. The image shows a white bowl containing white creamy yogurt with visible small chunks of apricot mixed in. The yogurt appears smooth and thick. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The bowl is a standard small to medium-sized dessert bowl, visible on a wooden surface with part of a laptop in the background for scale. The yogurt fills roughly just under half of the bowl’s depth, spread evenly on the bottom. Based on typical bowl sizes, this amount of yogurt likely occupies approximately 100-120 ml in volume. Step 3: Density Considerations - Yogurt has a density close to water but slightly thicker; typical density is roughly 1.03 g/ml to 1.05 g/ml. Since apricot pieces are included, the density remains similar or slightly higher depending on fruit chunk quantity, but overall close to 1 g/ml. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given the visual volume (~110 ml) and density (~1.03 g/ml), the approximate weight is 110 to 115 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - The portion is smaller than a full standard industrial yogurt pot, corresponding to a smaller serving placed in the bowl. The visible chunks are sparse and small, so do not add significant extra weight. Step 6: Final check - The estimate is reasonable, not exceeding expected yogurt servings without assuming more than what the image shows. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the apricot yogurt with pieces at approximately 112 grams."

The target food item is 'haricots rouges' (red kidney beans) on the plate. Visually, the haricots rouges are located on the left side of the plate. They appear as a small pile of roughly 35-40 individual beans, somewhat shiny with a wet surface, indicating they are cooked. The pile covers about one sixth of the plate's surface. The plate diameter is about 24 cm, providing a size reference. The beans are stacked mostly in a single layer with some slight depth, approximately 1.5 cm thick on average. Each bean appears medium-sized, about 2.5-3 cm long, typical for kidney beans. Considering their density and water content (cooked kidney beans are dense and moderately heavy), an average cooked kidney bean weighs about 1 gram. Given about 35-40 beans, total estimated weight is around 35-40 grams. Accounting for slight compactness and spacing, I estimate total weight of the haricots rouges to be approximately 38 grams."

The target food item ""sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon)"" is identifiable in the image as the creamy mushroom sauce coating visible mushroom pieces mixed with the pasta. The visible mushrooms in the sauce are about 8 pieces of varying size, each roughly 3-4 cm in length, appearing thick and dense. The sauce is creamy, reasonably thick, and coats both mushrooms and pasta but does not pool visibly at the bottom of the bowl. The bowl is a medium-sized takeout container roughly 12 cm in diameter, and the sauce-covered mushrooms take up around one-third of the total volume. Given the creamy consistency and density of mushrooms, the sauce portion visually corresponds to approximately 130-160 grams. I account for the mushrooms' density, cream, and the sauce coating, and since only the sauce weight (including mushrooms in it) is requested, the pasta and courgettes are excluded. Considering sauce coverage, volume occupied, and visual thickness, a conservative and reasonable estimate for this sauce portion is 150 grams."

The image shows a white bowl partially filled with cereal and milk. The cereal pieces appear to be a mix of flakes and small chunks, with some pieces submerged in milk and some floating. The cereal appears to cover roughly one quarter of the bottom surface of the bowl with a thin layer visible, possibly about 0.5 to 1 cm in thickness considering the milk submersion. The spoon inside gives a size reference: the bowl is medium-sized (approx. 16-18 cm in diameter), and the cereal layer is thin and spread out rather than piled up. Given that cereal is a light but moderately dense food, and estimating the volume of visible cereal plus submerged parts, I estimate around 25 to 30 grams of cereal. The milk volume and weight are not included as per instructions. Therefore, the weight of the cereals is approximately 28 grams."

The target food item is 'tiramisu'. The image shows one single serving piece of tiramisu on a small dark plate, alongside a piece of forêt noir. The tiramisu slice is an elongated rectangle with visible layers of creamy mascarpone and soaked sponge or biscuit. The portion size appears about 10 cm long, 4-5 cm wide, and around 3-4 cm thick based on comparison with the plate size and the forêt noir piece. The tiramisu has a dense cream layer and a spongy, moist cake layer which both add to the weight, but the overall volume is moderate, not piled or very thick. Considering density of tiramisu (~0.7-0.9 g/cm3) which is moderately dense due to cream and soaked cake layers. Estimating the volume to be roughly 10 cm x 4.5 cm x 3.5 cm = 157.5 cm3. Multiplying by density ~0.8 results in approximately 126 grams. Adjusting slightly downward to account for some air in the sponge and lightness of cream, a conservative estimate is about 120 grams. Therefore, the tiramisu piece weighs about 120 grams."

The image shows a single slice of homemade fondant au chocolat on a white plate. The slice is triangular and appears to be about a medium thickness for this type of cake, roughly around 3 cm in height at the thickest point. The base of the slice is approximately 12 cm in length and the width (at the widest part) could be roughly 6-7 cm. The texture appears dense and moist, typical of a chocolate fondant cake, indicating a relatively high density. Comparing the slice size to the visible part of the plate and the cup handle in the background, this is a moderate slice size. The cake is solid and rich, so its density weighs more than light cakes. Based on these visual cues, the estimated weight for this single slice of fondant au chocolat is around 120 grams."

In the image, the target food item ""kiwi"" is visible as multiple cut pieces placed on top of séré maigre in a bowl. I count approximately 14 kiwi pieces of varying sizes, mostly small wedges. Each kiwi piece has a roughly triangular cross-section with a visible thickness of around 1-1.5 cm. The kiwi pieces cover about half the surface area of the bowl and are piled without significant layering underneath since the séré maigre is visible below. The bowl diameter appears to be around 15 cm based on the stovetop ring size next to it, giving the kiwi coverage area about 50-60 square cm and a depth of roughly 1.2 cm on average. The density of kiwi, being a juicy fruit with skin removed, is moderate (~1 g/cm3). Multiplying estimated volume by density gives roughly 60 to 80 grams. Considering visible volume, individual piece sizes, and typical water content, I estimate the total weight of kiwi in this serving to be about 75 grams."

The image shows a metal container with several distinct food items arranged in sections. The target food item is 'tomate', which is located on the left side of the container. The visible tomatoes appear as two large slices or wedges, bright red in color, with some seed areas visible. These tomato pieces occupy roughly a quarter of the container's surface area, but their thickness is limited, approximately 1.5 to 2 cm thick as estimated by visual depth relative to the container walls. Compared to other items, the tomato pieces are denser than grated carrots but less dense than tofu. The container is about standard lunchbox size, and based on the visible portion and packing density, the total volume of tomatoes is moderate but not excessive. Given that fresh tomato density is roughly 0.9 g/cm³ and the estimated volume of these pieces is about 90-110 cm³, this gives a weight range of approximately 80 to 100 grams. Accounting for some irregular shape and slight under or overestimation in thickness, a conservative but accurate estimate is around 90 grams for the visible tomato pieces shown, excluding any skin or seeds outside the pieces. This fits the visible portion and avoids overestimation."

The image shows a single rectangular waffle (gaufre) on a decorative plate. The waffle has a grid structure with 12 visible square pockets. The waffle appears crispy and has a thickness of approximately 1.5-2 cm based on the visible edge profile. The size of the waffle is about the size of a small hand palm, roughly 12 cm by 8 cm. The compote pomme partially covers the waffle but does not affect the waffle's weight. Since the target food item is the waffle only, the compote is ignored. Waffles are moderately dense due to eggs, flour, and some fat. Given its size, thickness, and density, a typical rectangular waffle this size weighs approximately 80-100 grams. I estimate this waffle to weigh around 90 grams."

The target food item is 'boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate'. Step 1: Visual Identification: There are 10 visible vegetable meatballs (boulettes) on the plate. They are fully visible and coated with tomato sauce. The meatballs appear uniform and are separate from the pasta beneath. Step 2: Dimension Analysis: Comparing them to the pasta and plate size, each meatball is approximately 3-4 cm in diameter, spherical but slightly uneven. Given the fork and knife size beside the plate, these are standard medium-size meatballs. Step 3: Density Considerations: Vegetable meatballs have moderate density, less than pure meat but still compact. Tomato sauce coating adds some moisture but not significant weight. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration: A typical vegetable meatball weighs around 25-30 grams. Given their size and number (10 pieces), the total weight likely ranges from 250 to 300 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation & final check: The weight is reasonable for 10 medium-sized vegetable balls. No overestimation for small size is needed, as these are standard portions. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate to be 275 grams."

The image shows a white plate divided roughly into three parts: cooked pâtes (fusilli), chili with visible chunks of cervelas, and a dollop of crème fraîche between the pâtes and chili. The target food named is ""cervelas."" In the chili portion, I observe multiple medium-sized pinkish chunks that are cervelas sausage pieces, mixed into the chili sauce and beans. Counting visible cervelas pieces, I find approximately 10 chunks varying from small to medium size. The chunks appear cubical or roughly rectangular, about 3-4 cm in length and thickness. The cervelas pieces are embedded in chili sauce, indicating some hidden volume beyond what is visible on the surface, so accounting for some below the visible top layer is needed. These pieces have a firm, dense meat texture typical of cooked sausages. Comparing piece size to fusilli (about 2 cm each) and the plate diameter (around 24 cm), the cervelas pieces are reasonably sized. Considering cervelas density (~1.1 g/cm³) and visual volume, I estimate an average chunk weight of about 20 grams, with 10 chunks yielding around 200 grams. However, since portions can be deceptive and chunks are somewhat irregular and partly covered, I apply a conservative downward correction of approximately 15% to avoid overestimation. This adjustment results in about 170 grams of cervelas meat present on the plate."

The image shows one piece of pain aux fruits being held between a thumb and index finger, which provides a clear size reference. The piece is roughly rectangular with an approximate length of about 6 cm and width around 4.5 cm, based on the fingers' size. The thickness appears to be thin, about 1.5 cm, as seen from the visible side edges. The surface has visible nuts and sugar crystals, suggesting some density, but the bread itself looks porous and moderately airy. Considering this, the item seems to be a small to medium piece of fruit bread with moderate density typical of fruit and nut breads, denser than regular bread but lighter than dense cake or pastry. Given these observations and the size, I estimate the weight to be in the range of roughly 50 to 70 grams. Applying a conservative estimate favoring density and visible size, I settle on approximately 60 grams for this single piece of pain aux fruits."
wrah5h,polenta,209.0,170.0,39.0,0.8687913024941377,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/f727ac79-973e-4b92-8f2b-cda94222d4a7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The food item to estimate is 'polenta'. In the image, the polenta is visible on the right side of the container, covered by a pile of grated cheese. The polenta portion appears as a roughly oval mound with a base covered by the cheese grate. The height of the polenta mound is about the same as the thickest part of the aubergine slices to the left, and roughly half the height of the container. The container is a metal rectangular food storage box that looks approximately 15-18 cm wide. The polenta occupies roughly one-third of the container's area, with an estimated visible surface roughly 7-8 cm by 5-6 cm, and a visible height around 3-4 cm under the cheese. Given that polenta is moderately dense, slightly spongy, and the mound is substantial rather than thin, I estimate the volume of the polenta to be approximately 150-200 cubic centimeters. Polenta has an approximate density close to that of cooked dense starch foods, roughly 1 g/cm3. Despite the cheese covering the top, it is unlikely to add much to the polenta volume, so the estimate focuses solely on the polenta mass itself, excluding cheese weight. Considering these visual observations and the moderate density of polenta, I estimate the polenta weight to be around 170 grams, accounting for the mound thickness, base area, and polenta texture."
8japfq,mozarella,71.0,110.0,39.0,0.2951396290769559,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/762d78e1-34d1-4942-b2a4-1094509831e3,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a white plate containing three types of foods: mozzarella, olives, and green salad. The target food is mozzarella. The mozzarella portion is a single, roughly hemispherical piece of cheese located at the top left of the plate. It has a smooth, shiny surface with some whey around it. The diameter of the mozzarella ball appears to be approximately 7 to 8 cm, considering the size relative to the olives (which are about 2-3 cm each) and the plate. The thickness (height) of the mozzarella portion looks to be about 2.5 to 3 cm. Mozzarella cheese is a dense dairy product with a density around 1 g/cm³, similar to water. To estimate volume: assuming the mozzarella is a hemisphere, approximate volume = (2/3)πr³. Using a radius of about 3.5 to 4 cm, volume ranges roughly from 90 to 135 cm³. Since density is close to 1 g/cm³, weight is approximately equal to volume in grams, so an estimated weight range is 90 to 135 grams. Visual surface irregularities and slight compression may lower this estimate. To be conservative and based on visual evidence, I estimate the mozzarella portion to weigh about 110 grams."

The perle de blé (wheat pearl) is the target food item in this image. It is visible as small round grains clustered in the lower-left half of the bowl, mixed with pieces of crevette and coated partially with the yellow sauce crème 15% au safran. The portion of perle de blé occupies about one third of the bowl's volume, sitting beneath and around the shrimp. Given the size of the bowl and the relative volume occupied by the perle de blé compared to the visible haricots coco on top, I estimate the perle de blé portion to be approximately 90-110 grams. Considering wheat grains cooked to a dense, moist consistency, I judge a mid-range estimate of 100 grams appropriate for this serving size. This estimation accounts for some depth beneath the visible surface and the sauce's binding effect adding to density."

The image shows three individual pieces of vegetarian gyoza on a white square plate. Each gyoza has a semi-circular shape with a visible fold edge, and the surface shows light browning, indicating pan-frying. The gyozas appear to be approximately 6-7 cm long and about 2-3 cm wide. The thickness of each gyoza is roughly 2 cm judging from the visible cross-sectional edges and puffiness. The plate provides a size reference, consistent with typical small appetizer portions. Each gyoza appears thin but filled with ingredients, leading to moderate density due to the dough wrapper and vegetable filling. Given their size and typical density of vegetarian dumplings, each piece likely weighs between 30 to 40 grams. Multiplying by three pieces and considering minor size differences, I estimate the total weight of the three vegetarian gyozas to be around 100 grams."

The image shows a small glass bowl containing what appears to be chocolate yogurt. The chocolate yogurt has a smooth, creamy texture with a light to medium brown color, well mixed but with some visible swirls. There are no separate pieces, just a single blended food item. The bowl is shallow and the yogurt fills roughly about 60-70% of the bowl's visible volume. The bowl's diameter appears to be about 10-12 cm, and the yogurt filling height is about 3-4 cm. Comparing to the size of the bowl, the visible volume of the yogurt is approximately 150 ml or slightly less. Given that yogurt density is close to water, approximately 1 g/ml, the weight would be similar to the volume. Taking into account the creamy consistency and slight air pockets (which can reduce density a bit), a slightly lower effective density of around 0.9-1.0 g/ml is reasonable. Thus, the chocolate yogurt portion in the bowl likely weighs around 135 to 150 grams. Given the visual evidence of a simple portion with no added densifiers or heavy toppings, I conservatively estimate the weight at 140 grams."

The target food item is 'salade de céleri,' which is located at the bottom right corner of the plate. Visually, this celery salad consists of finely shredded white strands piled into a small mound. The pile appears loosely packed with some air gaps between the pieces. The plate size and other items suggest a medium-sized plate commonly around 25 cm width. Comparing the celery salad mound to the carrot salad (top right), which is denser and forms a slightly larger pile, the celery salad is approximately 60-70% of that volume. The depth looks around 2-3 cm. Given the density of shredded celery mixed with a light creamy or vinegar dressing, the texture is somewhat dense but not very heavy—celery is a fibrous, relatively light vegetable, but the dressing adds some moisture weight. Estimating volume: roughly a 7 cm by 6 cm base, about 2.5cm thickness = approx. 105 cm³. Considering celery salad density about 0.8 g/cm³ due to dressing and moisture, this yields ~85 grams. Allowing some margin for dressing unevenness and slight packing difference, a conservative estimate ranges 80-90 grams. Therefore, the estimated weight of the salade de céleri on this plate is about 85 grams."

The target food item to estimate is 'thon' (tuna). The image shows a glass container filled with a mixed dish containing couscous, diced cucumber, tuna flakes, and visible pumpkin seeds. Focusing on the tuna, it appears as shredded light pink chunks dispersed evenly throughout the dish. Counting visible tuna portions, there are approximately 10-12 distinguishable small tuna flakes, scattered but not densely packed. Each tuna flake seems moderately sized, roughly 2-3 cm in length and about 1 cm thick on average. The depth of the tuna within the container is mixed in but does not form a solid layer, indicating some volume but not a heavy concentration. Given tuna's relatively dense nature compared to couscous and cucumber, and noting the tuna pieces are not piled high but thinly spread, I estimate each visible tuna flake to weigh around 5 grams on average. Accepting slight size variation and potential hidden tuna beneath the visible top layer, I apply a multiplier for hidden volume of about 1.3. This results in an estimated total tuna weight of approximately 65 grams. This estimation is consistent with the visible quantity of tuna dispersed through the approximately 500-600 ml container, and accounting for the density of canned tuna. Thus, the estimated weight for 'thon' is 65 grams."

The target food item is 'mais' (corn). The image shows a white plate with four distinct food groups: broccoli florets on the left, green lettuce salad at the top, a pile of yellow corn kernels near the bottom center, and a pile of chickpeas to the right. The corn kernels form a relatively small pile, roughly spherical in shape, partially spread but contained in a small area occupying approximately 1/8 of the plate's surface. The corn appears to be cooked or canned style, with a moderate density. Comparing to the size of the chickpeas and broccoli pieces, and using the plate diameter as reference (typically about 24 cm), the corn pile is visually about 6 cm in diameter and about 1-1.5 cm in height/thickness. Given the density of corn kernels and the visible volume, the corn portion would be moderate but not very large. Estimating volume around 30-40 cubic centimeters would be reasonable. Corn density is about 0.7 g/cm3 when cooked. Multiplying volume by density gives an estimate around 25-30 grams. Considering the visible amount and avoiding overestimation, I estimate the weight of the corn on this plate to be approximately 28 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing one single scoop of vanilla ice cream ('boule de glace vanille') covered partly with hot chocolate sauce. The scoop is roughly spherical and occupies about one quarter to one third of the bowl's visible interior base area. Comparing the scoop size to the bowl size and considering standard bowl diameters of around 15 cm, the ice cream scoop appears to be a medium-sized single scoop, approximately 6-7 cm in diameter. Given the smooth texture and density typical of vanilla ice cream, a standard medium-sized scoop typically weighs around 80-100 grams. The visible depth and volume of the scoop do not suggest a smaller or larger size than usual. Therefore, based on the visible volume, shape, and typical density of ice cream, the estimated weight of the 'boule de glace vanille' is approximately 85 grams."

The target food item is 'tonic au gingembre,' which corresponds to the bottled drink labeled 'GINGER' in the image. The bottle is made of glass and appears almost full, with a small volume of liquid consumed. The bottle is a standard small glass beverage bottle, approximately 20 cm tall, with a narrow neck, typical for single-serving tonic or ginger beer bottles. Comparing the bottle size relative to the nearby glass and phone, the capacity likely matches a typical 200-250 ml glass bottle. Since the beverage is mostly liquid, and the density of tonic or ginger tonic is close to water, 1 ml roughly equals 1 gram. Given the bottle is filled near full, I estimate the liquid content to be about 230 grams, accounting for a slight visible reduction in level. No container weight is included, so only the liquid volume is considered. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'tonic au gingembre' in the bottle is approximately 230 grams."

Visually, it appears to be medium-sized, roughly filling the palm. Comparing to the fingers and thumb holding it, the pear's length is about 12-14 cm, and its width around 6-7 cm at the widest part. The depth/thickness is consistent with a typical pear, giving it a near-oval volume. Given the visual density and normal water content of pears, and the close grip suggesting a standard medium pear, I estimate the weight to be approximately 170 grams. This fits well with medium pears usually weighing between 150-200 grams, and the visual cues lean towards the middle of that range."

The target food item is 'fromage de brebis/chèvre (2 bouts)', which translates to two pieces of sheep/goat cheese. On the plate, there are exactly two small chunks of cheese located near the center bottom left area of the plate. Each piece is roughly wedge-shaped. Compared to the slice of bread and the knife handle for scale, each piece appears roughly 3-4 cm in length, about 2 cm in width, and roughly 1.5-2 cm thick. The cheeses have a semi-firm texture but are not dense like aged hard cheese, more like soft to semi-soft fresh cheese. Given the size, each piece likely weighs around 20-25 grams, as soft cheese density is about 1 g/cm3 and volume is small. Combining both pieces, I estimate the total weight of the two cheese pieces to be about 45 grams. This estimate respects the visual size, shape, and texture of the pieces relative to other items on the plate without overestimating their volume or density."

The image shows a single whole artichaut (artichoke) placed on a medium-sized plate, with a small pool of sauce or dressing beside it. Visually, the artichaut appears intact with its leaves closed tightly. The diameter of the plate can be roughly estimated by comparing to the hand holding it, suggesting a standard dinner plate size around 25-28 cm. The artichaut occupies roughly one-third of the plate's diameter lengthwise, indicating it is roughly 8-9 cm long and similarly wide in diameter when viewed from above. The thickness or depth of the artichaut seems consistent with a typical small to medium-sized vegetable of this type, approximately 6-7 cm thick, as suggested by the side profile of the leaves and the visible volume. Artichokes are dense vegetables with a significant amount of fibrous and edible material within the tightly packed leaves. Given these visual dimensions and the density of an artichoke, a small to medium-sized whole artichoke typically weighs between 150-200 grams. Since this one looks slightly on the smaller side of medium and compact, I estimate it to be about 170 grams."
p96w4a,houmous au basilic (acheté),34.0,60.0,26.0,0.09422298017480281,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/fab584a3-42d9-4217-a493-ec0d71878e56,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'houmous au basilic (acheté)', which is visible in a small glass container next to the plate. The container is half-full, showing a creamy dip with a smooth texture and some green color indicative of basil. The glass is about the size of a small appetizer cup approximately 6 cm in height and 5 cm in diameter. The visible amount of hummus fills roughly 50% of this container, with a portion height about 3 cm. Considering the typical density of hummus, roughly 0.95 to 1.05 g/cm3, the volume can be approximated using the cylinder volume formula: π × (2.5 cm)^2 × 3 cm ≈ 59 cm3. Multiplying by density ~1 g/cm3 results in approximately 59 grams of hummus. Given some uncertainty in exact container size and fill level, a conservative estimate would be about 55 to 65 grams. I thus estimate the weight of the 'houmous au basilic (acheté)' in the glass as 60 grams based on the visual evidence."

The image shows a single slice of tarte aux fraises on a plate. The slice is topped with about 7 to 8 strawberry halves that are medium-sized. The strawberries cover most of the top surface of the slice. The tart filling is creamy and dense, visible beneath the strawberries, with a layer of crust below that appears to be thin and crunchy. The slice is roughly 12 cm long and about 5-6 cm at its widest visible point. The depth of the slice, including crust, filling, and strawberries, is about 2.5-3 cm. The strawberries are fresh with visible moisture and seeds, contributing moderately to weight, but they are relatively light compared to the creamy filling and crust. Considering density, the creamy filling is the densest part, followed by the crust which is flaky and light. The strawberries, despite their volume, are less dense but still contribute significantly to the weight. Estimating the slice volume and density, and considering typical component weights for this type of tart, the total weight is roughly around 130-150 grams. Given the visible portion size and components, I estimate the weight of this tarte aux fraises slice to be 140 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing cereals and milk. The cereals consist mostly of irregular granola clusters and a few small chocolate chunks. The milk is partially filling the bowl but is not part of the targeted food weight. The clusters vary in size, with some larger ones about 3-4 cm in length and smaller broken pieces scattered around. The chocolate chunks appear to be about 1 cm square. The cereal layer appears to be shallow, roughly 1-1.5 cm thick, floating in milk, so the total volume of cereal is limited by this thin spread. Reference objects include the spoon positioned near the bowl’s edge and the bowl itself, which seems to be a small to medium size. Given the airy nature of granola clusters and low density compared to liquids, I estimate individual clusters weigh about 3-5 grams and smaller pieces less than 1 gram each. Counting roughly 12-15 main cereal pieces plus smaller fragments, the total dry cereal weight likely falls between 35 and 50 grams. Considering conservative volume and density estimates for this type of cereal partially soaked in milk but without counting milk weight, I estimate the cereal weight to be about 42 grams."
8japfq,cottage cheese aux herbes,37.0,15.0,22.0,0.08676188445960349,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/0bd218b2-a4c6-4605-8737-2055d3040f25,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'cottage cheese aux herbes', which is located near the bottom center of the plate directly above the egg and beside the hummous. Visually, the cottage cheese appears as a small mound of white curds with herb flecks mixed in. From the plate size and relative size of the other items (like both types of bread rolls and the egg), the portion of cottage cheese is modest. Each curd grain is small and the pile is roughly flat and spread with a thickness around 1 cm and about 5 cm wide and 3 cm deep in area. Given the typical density of cottage cheese, which is light but moist, and that the portion occupies roughly a 15 cm² surface area with about 1 cm thickness, the volume is approximately 15 cm³. Cottage cheese density is about 1 g/cm³, so this volume roughly corresponds to about 15 grams. However, to account for herbed mix and slight overestimation of volume, a small margin is applied, leading to an estimate between 12-18 grams. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'cottage cheese aux herbes' to be about 15 grams."
p96w4a,oeuf,29.0,50.0,21.0,0.06491153272223407,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/4e021399-8a90-44fe-b06c-0955cd2280f7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification - The egg ('oeuf') is visible as a single, hard-boiled egg cut in half on the plate at the top right of the food portion. Only half of the egg is visible, with the yolk clearly exposed and the white intact around it. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Using the plate as a reference, a standard plate diameter is roughly 25 cm. The half egg measures about 3.5 cm long and 2.5 cm wide in the visible half. Considering typical egg size, the whole egg would be approximately twice that portion. The egg is typical in thickness, about 3 cm from white to yolk center, which matches a medium-sized egg. Step 3: Density Considerations - A hard-boiled egg has a known density close to water and weighs approximately 50 grams for a medium-sized egg. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Since only half the egg is on the plate, and this half appears complete with white and yolk intact, the total weight of the whole egg can be estimated as about 50 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The size and appearance of the egg half are consistent with a medium chicken egg. The weight estimate of 50 grams is within the common range for eggs and visually matches the reference objects on the plate. Step 6: Final Check - This weight makes sense given the visible half portion and the plate size, and does not overestimate the food portion. There is no reason to adjust the weight further as the egg appears complete and unaltered. Therefore, the weight of the whole egg is estimated at 50 grams."

The target food item is ""sauce."" The image shows a white plate with mashed potatoes, beef stew chunks, carrots, and brown sauce covering and surrounding the food. The sauce is visibly spread thinly over the mashed potatoes and pooled around the plate base. It extends beyond the main food portions, covering approximately half of the plate's visible surface area but with low height/thickness—likely around 3-5 mm thick as a liquid rather than a dense solid. The plate diameter is a standard medium size (about 24 cm), and the pool of sauce roughly covers a circle of approximately 12-15 cm in diameter on the plate bottom. Given the thin layering of the liquid sauce, and considering that sauce density is close to water (~1 g/ml), the volume of the sauce can be approximated as a shallow layer over an area of about 140 cm² with a thickness of around 0.4 cm. This yields roughly 56 ml or grams of sauce (140 cm² × 0.4 cm = 56 cm³ = 56 ml). A conservative adjustment downward is made for irregular thickness and gaps where the sauce is thin or absent, reducing the estimate to approximately 40 grams. This accounts for some sauce absorption into the mashed potatoes and the irregular spread on the plate. Thus, the estimated weight of the sauce visible on the plate based on visual evidence is approximately 40 grams."

The target food item is 'bout de gruyère'. On the plate, it is a single rectangular slice of cheese positioned centrally. It appears to be approximately 12 cm long, about 2 cm wide, and roughly 1.5 cm thick based on relative size compared to the nearby carrot sticks and baguette slices. Gruyère is a dense cheese with a typical density close to 1.1 g/cm³. Calculating volume gives approximately 12 cm × 2 cm × 1.5 cm = 36 cm³. Multiplying volume by density (36 × 1.1) results in about 40 grams. Visually, the piece looks solid and uncut and matches well with this estimate considering no significant missing portions or anomalies. Therefore, the weight of the 'bout de gruyère' is best estimated at 40 grams."

In the image, there is a single peeled banana piece lying horizontally on a dark surface. It appears to be only a portion of a banana, roughly half or slightly less of an average banana. The length of this banana piece is about the size of a hand width or slightly smaller, approximately 8-10 cm. The banana is peeled completely with its natural ridges and soft texture visible. Its thickness is consistent with a medium banana, around 3-4 cm in diameter. Considering the density of bananas, which is firm and moist, and noting this is a peeled portion, I estimate the weight by comparing to a whole average banana weight around 120-130 grams in Switzerland. Since this piece seems to be about half or just below half of a typical banana, I estimate the weight to be in the range of 55-70 grams. To be conservative and grounded in visual volume and typical banana density, the estimate I choose is 60 grams."

The target food item is ""caviar d'aubergine,"" which is the light-colored spread on the slice of bread on the right side of the plate. Visually, the caviar d'aubergine covers nearly the full surface of one slice of bread, which appears to be around 12 cm long and 6-7 cm wide. The spread layer looks thin but even, roughly about 3-4 mm thick. Given the texture and typical density of eggplant caviar (a slightly moist, pureed vegetable spread), it is lighter than dense pastes but still has some moisture content, so an approximate density of about 0.9 g/cm3 is reasonable. Estimating the volume: slice area is about 75 cm2 (12x6.5), thickness 0.35 cm, giving 26 cm3; density times volume gives approximately 23-25 grams of spread. A small reduction is applied for slight unevenness and spread thickness variation. Therefore, the total estimated weight of the caviar d'aubergine spread on the bread is about 23 grams."

The image shows a bowl containing two distinct portions: white rice on one side and dahl de lentilles corail on the other, with a spoon resting across the top. Focusing on the rice: it occupies approximately half of the bowl's visible surface area. The grains look well-cooked and clumped, typical of steamed or boiled rice. The bowl is of medium size, roughly 15 cm in diameter based on the spoon length which is an average teaspoon of approximately 14-15 cm. The depth of the bowl appears moderate, and the visible rice is heaped up to about two-thirds of bowl depth corresponding to a dense, compact portion. Based on visual volume comparison, the rice portion seems to occupy a volume close to 200-250 ml. Given cooked rice density around 0.9 g/ml, the weight estimation for the rice portion ranges from approximately 180 to 225 grams. I will conservatively estimate closer to the middle, at about 200 grams, considering no overspill or excessive height beyond the bowl edge is visible and the volume is not overflowing. Therefore, the best weight estimate for the rice portion in this image is 200 grams."

The image shows a single slice of toasted bread (tartine) on a white plate, with a visible spread of both chestnut cream (crème de marrons) and butter. The slice of bread is roughly medium sized, about 10 cm in length and 5-6 cm wide. The bread thickness appears thin but typical for a slice of toast, approximately 1 to 1.5 cm. The chestnut cream and butter are spread unevenly but do not appear overly thick; the spread covers most of the surface but is thin enough to see some texture beneath. Considering the combined density of toasted bread and a thin spread of chestnut cream plus butter (both relatively dense substances but lightly applied), the portion is small. The bread slice likely weighs between 25-30 grams, with the spread contributing an additional approximate 5-7 grams. Total weight estimation is therefore around 32 grams. The crumbs visible support this as a typical single slice of toast portion. Since this is a single piece, I do not multiply. I have applied downward corrections for thin spreading and the relatively small surface area covered."

The image shows a white plate with four slices of cheese on the left side and a piece of bread on the right side. The slices of cheese vary slightly in size and shape but are all thin cuts, roughly between 3 and 6 cm in length and about 3 cm wide. Their thickness appears to be around 3 to 5 mm, judging by the edge profile and the general flatness of the slices. The cheeses are named as manchego, two kinds of gruyère, and raclette, all semi-hard cheeses with moderate density. These types of cheese typically weigh around 1.1 to 1.3 grams per cubic centimeter. Estimating the volume for each slice conservatively: the largest slice has approximately 6 cm x 3 cm x 0.4 cm = 7.2 cm3; the smaller slices range roughly from 3 to 5 cm3 in volume. Summing volumes approximately 18 cm3 total, and multiplying by an average density of 1.2 g/cm3 gives around 22 grams total for all cheese slices. This estimate excludes any container weight or crust weight from the bread, and is based solely on visible cheese slices."

The image shows a single peeled carrot laying flat on a kitchen surface. The carrot is whole, without greens or visible cuts except at the bottom end where it is cleanly sliced. The carrot appears to be of medium thickness, roughly cylindrical but slightly tapered, and about 12-14 cm long when compared to the subtle texture of the granite-like countertop, which gives an approximate size reference. Typical medium carrots usually weigh between 70-100 grams. Given that this carrot is peeled, there is a slight reduction in weight compared to an unpeeled one. There is no indication of heaviness or lightness beyond normal fresh carrot density, which is moderately dense. Taking into account the carrot's size, peeled state, and typical vegetable density, I estimate the weight to be around 80 grams."

The target food item is 'sauce curry avec mayonnaise'. In the image, there are two sandwiches on a plate. Inside each sandwich, there is a visible spread of yellow sauce that looks like curry mayonnaise applied on the inner sides of the bread. The sauce is thinly spread, covering the length of the bread, with some variation in thickness. The quantity is not piled but rather a thin layer just enough to flavor the sandwich. The bread size is about 15 cm long; the thickness of the sauce layer appears less than 5 mm on average, covering roughly a surface area of 150 cm² per sandwich. Considering the creamy, dense nature of curry mayonnaise, the sauce likely weighs more than a thin spread of mustard but less than a thick dollop. Estimating the weight of sauce per sandwich to be around 15 grams is reasonable, so for the two sandwiches combined, the total is approximately 30 grams. There is no visible excess amount or additional containers of sauce. Therefore, the estimated weight of 'sauce curry avec mayonnaise' visible in the image is 30 grams."

The target food item is 'sauce oignons' (onion sauce), visible on top of and around the slices of roast beef ('rôti') on the plate. Step 1: Visual Identification - The sauce is reddish-brown with visible slices of cooked onions, spread over the meat and slightly pooled on the plate. The quantity is limited to the amount covering the meat and the small liquid spread around it. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The sauce appears as a thin cover on 3 medium meat slices and a few extra spoonfuls around, occupying roughly a flat area of about 8cm by 6cm with an estimated average thickness of around 3-4 mm, recognizing it is mostly liquid with some onion pieces. Step 3: Density Considerations - The sauce is mainly liquid, with water-like density approximating 1g/cm3. Onion slices are thin and not dense. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Calculating volume: 8cm x 6cm x 0.35cm (3.5mm average thickness) = 16.8 cm3, which roughly translates to 16.8 grams, rounding up slightly considering onions in the sauce. Step 5: Cross-validation - The estimate seems reasonable considering typical sauce portions over a roast; it is not a large pool but spread thinly. Step 6: Final check - Weight is under 50g which is plausible for sauce portion here. Therefore, the 'sauce oignons' weight is estimated at about 17 grams based solely on visible amount and spread on and around the meat slices."

Dark chocolate is dense with a typical density close to 1.2 g/cm³. Calculating an estimated volume of roughly 3.5 cm × 2 cm × 0.7 cm = 4.9 cm³, and multiplying by density gives approximately 5.9 grams.

The lemon slice is fully visible, circular, and thin, with an estimated diameter of about 6-7 cm based on the typical size of the glass rim, which is a standard drinking glass of approximately 7 cm diameter. The thickness of the lemon slice appears to be around 0.3 to 0.5 cm judging by the visible edge profile. Lemons are dense with water content, but a thin slice like this is mostly water and pulp. Given the diameter and thinness, the slice is relatively light. Estimating the weight roughly by volume, it is likely between 5 and 8 grams. To be conservative and based on the visual evidence, I estimate the weight of the lemon slice to be 6 grams."

The target food is 'dahl de lentille' which is clearly distinguishable in the image as the orange-red lentil stew mixed with visible chunks of vegetables like carrots and onions. It occupies the majority of the white bowl, covering the surface with some layering and some rice partially visible beneath it. It appears to be about three-quarters full of dahl lentils in a medium-sized bowl, approximated by comparison to the laptop keyboard and fork nearby, suggesting a bowl diameter around 15 cm and depth around 6-7 cm. The dahl has a thick, dense texture typical of lentil stews, adding to its weight density. Considering the depth and portion, a conservative visual volume estimate of the dahl is roughly 250-300 ml, which, given the dense stew consistency, corresponds roughly to around 270 grams. The rice is visible beneath but is not the target for estimation. Based on these observations, I estimate the weight of the dahl de lentille in the bowl to be approximately 270 grams."

The chili is located on the right half of the plate, distinctly separated from the pasta and crème fraîche. Visually, the chili contains several visible chunks of cervelas sausage, along with kidney beans and a thick tomato-based sauce. I count about 8-10 chunks of sausage in varying sizes. The chili portion covers roughly half the surface area of the plate and appears to be about 2-3 cm thick based on the visible depth and volume, considering it is a dense mix of meat and beans in sauce. The plate is of standard diameter (about 25 cm) so the chili occupies approximately 1/2 of the plate area, minus the volume taken by other elements. Given the density of cooked meat, beans, and sauce, and the thickness, I judge the chili weight to be in the range of 160-200 grams. I select an estimate towards the middle given visible volume and chunk size. Therefore, the estimated weight of the chili is approximately 180 grams."

The target food is ""avocat"" (avocado). Visually, there is one single slice of avocado on the plate, placed below two skewers of chicken and near the shredded carrots and bread piece. The avocado piece is about 1/6 to 1/5 of a typical avocado fruit, roughly wedge-shaped with visible density and some skin still attached. Comparing its size to the skewers and the bread piece, it appears about 7-8 cm long, 2-3 cm wide, and approximately 1.5-2 cm thick. Avocado is relatively dense, so considering these dimensions and its volume, the slice likely weighs between 35 and 50 grams. Being conservative and accounting for some density variability and visible size, I estimate the avocado slice to weigh approximately 40 grams."

The image shows a glass container filled with a mixed dish containing couscous, cucumber pieces, tuna flakes, and some visible pumpkin seeds (graines de courge). The target food item is 'graines de courge'. Visually, the pumpkin seeds are scattered sparsely throughout the mixture, appearing as small, flat dark green pieces, embedded within the couscous and other ingredients. Counting visible pieces, there are approximately 10-15 seeds visible on the surface. Given the depth of the container and the density of the mixture, it is likely there are pumpkin seeds spread internally throughout, but the quantity remains small compared to other ingredients. The seeds appear thin and light, and the total volume they occupy is quite small—roughly equivalent to a tablespoon or slightly less. Estimating weight, pumpkin seeds typically weigh about 0.8 grams per tablespoon. Considering the visual evidence and sparse distribution, the total weight of graines de courge in this container is approximately 6 grams, allowing for some seeds hidden inside the mixture but not in large quantities."

The target food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries). I locate the blueberries in the image, which are the dark blue berries clustered on the left side of the bowl. I count approximately 11 individual blueberries visible. These blueberries vary slightly in size, but most appear medium sized. For dimensional analysis, the blueberries are about the size of a thumbnail, roughly 1.5 to 2 cm in diameter, and spherical. Comparing with the human hand holding the bowl, the size appears consistent with typical fresh blueberries. Blueberries are dense fruits with a high water content, and each berry weighs roughly 1 to 1.5 grams on average. Given the visible count and slight size variation, I estimate an average weight of 1.3 grams per blueberry. Multiplying 11 berries by 1.3 grams gives around 14.3 grams total. Considering some possible hidden blueberries among the cluster and minor visual occlusion, I add a small buffer of about 15-20% to account for partial obstruction, increasing the estimate to about 16-17 grams. However, since only clearly visible blueberries count, I keep the weight conservative at 16 grams. This estimation aligns with the volume they visually occupy on the plate and the natural density of blueberries."

Step 1: Visual Identification. The target food is 'pâtes' (pasta). In the image, the pasta is located beneath the mushroom sauce on the left side of the plate. The pasta appears as flat, ribbon-like noodles, possibly tagliatelle or fettuccine. The pile of pasta is spread out and appears somewhat compacted underneath the mushrooms. Step 2: Dimension Analysis. The plate's diameter is typical (around 25-28 cm), and the pasta occupies roughly one quarter of the plate’s surface area. Visually, the pasta mound is low, approximately 2 cm thick on average, with a spread roughly 8 cm by 7 cm. Given the flat noodle shape, the volume can be approximated as a low, flat pile. Assuming a rectangular base to approximate volume: 8 cm × 7 cm × 2 cm equals 112 cm³. Step 3: Density Considerations. Cooked pasta is dense and compact, roughly 1.3 g/cm³. Thus, 112 cm³ × 1.3 g/cm³ = approximately 145.6 grams. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration. The pasta serves as just under a typical medium portion but is not compacted into a full serving. Considering some air gaps and irregular shape, the estimate could be adjusted slightly down by around 10%. Step 5: Cross-Validation. The amount is visually less than a typical full pasta plate serving; thus, a reduced weight estimate is reasonable. Step 6: Final Error-Prevention Check. The weight is clearly under 200g, matches the visible pasta portion, and avoids overestimation given the visible volume and density. Final estimate: approximately 130 grams."

The target food item is 'fromage'. The image shows two slices of brown bread, one spread with mayonnaise and the other topped with multiple thin slices of cheese ('fromage') and two small pickles ('cornichons'). The cheese slices are narrow and thin, layered slightly overlapping each other, with approximately 7 visible slices. Each slice is about the length of the bread slice (~10 cm) and quite thin (~1-2 mm thickness). Considering the density of cheese and its thickness, each thin slice might weigh around 5 grams. Multiplying 7 slices by 5 grams each gives 35 grams, but to account for variation in slice thickness and slight overlapping, a reduction is appropriate. Therefore, the estimated total weight of the cheese is about 30 grams."

The target food item is 'muesli nature'. Visually, the muesli is in a metal bowl, covering most of the visible surface except for part where some natural yogurt is showing. The muesli pieces are loose, granular, and cover roughly 70-80% of the top surface. The bowl appears to be medium sized based on the texture and relative depth visible from the meniscus of the yogurt portion, which takes about 20-30% of the volume. The muesli granules fill a single layer with some minor piling in places but are mostly spread evenly. The density of dry muesli is relatively low, with loose grain structure and air gaps. Considering the volume of visible muesli, approximately 70-80% of a medium bowl, and typical density of muesli around 0.3-0.4 g/ml, I estimate the visible amount of muesli to be about 40-50 grams. Applying a conservative estimate of about 45 grams for 'muesli nature' in this image based on actual visual evidence and avoiding overestimation for loose dry grains."

The image shows a white bowl with a creamy mixture containing visible black chia seeds ('graines de chia') distributed throughout the mixture. The chia seeds appear small and individual, dispersed evenly but not piled. Given the size of the bowl as a typical medium-sized cereal bowl (roughly 15 cm diameter) and the scattered nature of the seeds within the mixture, the visible chia seeds represent a thin layer mixed in with the rest of the ingredients. Chia seeds are small and dense, but the portion of seeds visible is relatively small compared to the entire volume of the bowl. Considering the amount of seeds dispersed throughout the mixture, it looks like about one to two tablespoons of chia seeds, which weigh approximately 12 to 20 grams. Given the visual dispersion and volume, I estimate the weight of the 'graines de chia' in this bowl to be about 15 grams."

The image shows a piece of bread (pain) with a spread of crème de marrons (chestnut cream) on top. The target food item is crème de marrons. Visually, the crème de marrons is applied as a thin to moderate layer covering almost the entire visible surface of the bread slice. The bread piece appears relatively small, about the size of a small hand slice approximately 7 cm long and 3-4 cm wide at the widest portion. The thickness of the chestnut cream spread looks uniform but thin, roughly around 2-3 millimeters thick when considering typical spread density and visual texture. There is no excessive height or layering of the chestnut cream, so no hidden volume beyond this thin layer. Comparing the visible area and estimated thickness, the volume of crème de marrons is small. Considering the density of chestnut cream, which is slightly thicker and denser than simple jams, I estimate a density close to 1.2 g/cm3. Estimating the spread surface area on the bread as roughly 20 cm2 and thickness 0.25 cm gives about 5 cubic centimeters, translating to approximately 6 grams. Therefore, the total weight of the visible crème de marrons spread is about 6 grams, conservatively rounded given visual evidence and typical density. This estimate is carefully adjusted downward to avoid overestimation of the very thin layer."

Each cashew nut is roughly similar in size, averaging about 3 cm in length and about 1.5 cm in thickness, which is consistent with typical cashew nut dimensions. The nuts appear whole and dry, not broken or fragmented. Using the hand as a scale reference, the volume of each cashew is roughly estimated. Cashew nuts are relatively dense, with an approximate density around 0.9 g/cm³. A single cashew nut roughly weighs around 1.2 to 1.4 grams on average. Multiplying by 18 pieces, the total weight is approximately between 21.6 g and 25.2 g. Given slight size and density variations, a conservative weight estimate for this portion of cashew nuts is about 23 grams."

The yogurt container is standard-sized, about 6-7 cm in height and 5-6 cm in diameter, with the container nearly full of smooth, homogeneous white yogurt. The visible volume suggests a typical single-serving yogurt pot. The apple beside it gives a good reference for scale; the pot is noticeably smaller in diameter but taller than the apple. Plain yogurt has a density close to that of water, roughly 1 g/cm³. A typical Swiss single-serving yogurt pot generally contains around 125 grams of yogurt. Given the visual evidence of the full container and standard size, and no indication it is partially consumed, I estimate the weight of the yogurt to be 125 grams based on the typical volume and density. No container weight is included, only the yogurt content."

The image shows one single cookie placed on a wooden surface. The cookie is round but irregularly shaped with visible cracks on the surface and 2 large chunks of dark chocolate embedded in it. The cookie appears to be roughly 7-8 cm in diameter judging by the wood grain size and its spacing, which is a typical size for a homemade or bakery-style chocolate chip cookie. The thickness appears moderate, about 1-1.5 cm from visual assessment of the cookie's edge, indicating it is neither very thin nor very thick. The texture suggests a dense cookie with some softness due to the slight cracking pattern. Considering the visible volume and the typical density of cookies made with chocolate chunks and a standard dough, an estimated weight for this cookie would be around 45-55 grams. Taking a conservative midpoint estimate based on size and density evidence, I estimate the cookie weighs approximately 50 grams."

Focusing exclusively on the peanut butter: it is a small amount spread in a patch on the lower left area of the plate, roughly oval in shape, about 5 cm long and 3 cm wide, with a thickness estimated at about 0.5 cm based on its slight pooling. Comparing it to the size of the banana and the plate diameter (around 22 cm), this is a small spoonful. Peanut butter is dense and heavy for its volume, so even a small visible portion has significant weight. Visually, the volume is approximately 7-8 cubic centimeters, which translates roughly to 14-16 grams (peanut butter density ~1.1-1.2 g/cm³). Considering possible slight spreading beyond visible edges, I estimate the peanut butter portion to be around 15 grams. No container weight is included, and this estimate is strictly from visible evidence."

The target food item is 'betterave' (beetroot). The image shows a blue plate containing several food items, including diced beetroot pieces located at the upper left side of the plate. I count approximately 15 individual beetroot pieces, all cubed and relatively uniform in size, but a few are smaller. The pieces appear moist and cooked, and they occupy a roughly square area about 6 cm by 6 cm in surface on the plate. Thickness of the beetroot cubes appears to be around 1.5 to 2 cm based on visible edges and comparison to the adjacent tomato slices and cucumber pieces. The beetroot is dense, thus the volume corresponds directly to weight. Comparing to the quinoa mound and tomato slices nearby, the beetroot portion is smaller but substantial. Using the surface area of approximately 36 cm² and thickness about 1.8 cm gives a volume of about 65 cm³. Beetroot density is close to 1 g/cm³, so weight in grams roughly matches the volume. Considering some air gaps between pieces, I reduce slightly the total mass estimate. Therefore, the estimated weight of the beetroot portion visible on the plate is about 60 grams."

Counting carefully, there are about 15 small, chopped green onion pieces visible. Each piece is very small, roughly a few millimeters in size. Considering the thinness and small size of chopped green onions, the weight per piece is very low, likely around 0.3 to 0.5 grams each, given they are mostly hollow and light. Multiplying by approximately 15 pieces, the total weight is roughly between 4.5 and 7.5 grams. Adjusting for some parts possibly hidden and slight visual underestimation, a final estimate of 6 grams for the onion is reasonable. There are no full onion slices or thick layers visible, only finely chopped green onion pieces with low density, so this moderate estimate is appropriate."

The target food item is ""yogourt orange sanguine,"" which is the yogurt with blood orange flavor mixed into a bowl with cereals and blueberries. Visually, the bowl is medium-sized, and the yogurt is not separate but mixed throughout the cereal and berries. There appears to be a creamy pinkish yogurt base closely integrated with the cereals and blueberries. The volume occupied by the yogurt itself can be approximated by looking at the overall portion size of the mix and estimating the ratio of yogurt to dry cereals and berries. The yogurt covers and binds most of the mixture, but the cereals take some volume as flakes, and the berries are discrete pieces scattered throughout. The spoon size and the bowl diameter indicate the bowl is roughly 15-17 cm in diameter. The mixture fills about 70-80% of the bowl's depth, with the yogurt appearing to be roughly 60-70% of the total volume of the mixture. Considering the density of yogurt is about 1 g/ml, and the cereals and berries add some bulk but less weight per volume, the yogurt portion visually corresponds to approximately 150-180 g within the detected bowl volume. Given yogurt's density and its integration with other components, a conservative estimate accounting for some dilution with cereals leads me to estimate the ""yogourt orange sanguine"" weight at approximately 165 grams."

The image shows two slices of toast on a white plate. The slices appear to be standard thickness sandwich bread size, roughly 10 cm by 10 cm each. One slice is whole, the other is roughly half a slice. Both slices are spread with fromage frais, a creamy spread applied in a thin and somewhat uneven layer. The thickness of fromage frais spread seems thin, about 2-3 mm on average, without large clumps or piles. Using a butter knife as scale (standard butter knife blade width ~2.5 cm), the toast slices are roughly consistent in size with typical sandwich bread. The density of fromage frais is similar to soft cream cheese or thick yogurt. The toast slices without spread weigh approximately 40 grams for the whole slice and 20 grams for the half slice. The fromage frais added is light but dense enough to add some weight; estimating about 10 grams spread on the whole slice and about 5 grams on the half slice based on coverage and thickness. Therefore, the total weight of fromage frais is around 15 grams for both slices combined. Since the target is 'toast', I exclude the spread. Toast weight is 40g for full slice plus 20g for half slice, totaling approximately 60 grams. No container weight is included, plate is excluded. Hence, estimated weight of 'toast' (only bread) is 60 grams."

The target food item is 'yogourt nature.' The image shows a piece of pain complet (whole grain bread) topped with a layer of white yogurt and some mirabelle jam on top. The yogurt layer covers the entire visible surface of the bread slice. The bread slice appears about 10 cm long and 6-7 cm wide, typical for a small slice of whole grain bread. The yogurt layer thickness looks modest; estimating roughly 0.5 to 1 cm thick, given how it spreads on the bread and considering the typical consistency of plain yogurt. Since the yogurt is spread evenly and not piled up, the volume is limited to roughly 30-50 ml or grams (plain yogurt density is close to 1 g/ml). There is no visible yogurt outside the bread, so only the spread on the bread counts. Given these observations and typical portion sizes of natural yogurt spread thinly on a slice of bread, I estimate the weight of 'yogourt nature' here to be around 40 grams, balancing the spread thickness and surface area."

The tomato sauce is a thin layer mostly visible on the top and sides, with slight charring visible around the edges. The thickness varies roughly between 2-3 cm. Considering puff pastry is light but contains fat and flour layers, and tomato sauce adds some weight but thinly spread, this single feuilleté is small and delicate. Estimating conservatively with these dimensions and density considerations, the weight of this single feuilleté with tomato sauce is likely around 25 grams. This estimate avoids overestimation given the small size and light nature of puff pastry."

The image shows two small solid milk chocolate figures shaped like rabbits placed on a flat surface. Each figure appears to be about the size of a small palm or roughly half the height of an average smartphone's width. Their volume can be approximated by considering them as small solid shapes with a compact but slightly irregular form due to ears and facial contours. The thickness and density typical of milk chocolate suggest a firm mass without hollow spaces. Considering the size relative to typical household objects visible (tabletop texture), each rabbit likely weighs between 25 to 40 grams. Since the estimate must be for one 'chocolat', and the image clearly shows two distinct pieces, I focus on one piece. To be conservative and account for slight overestimation from visual rounding, I place the estimate closer to the lower-mid point. Therefore, the estimated weight of one chocolate rabbit is approximately 30 grams."

The image shows a small amount of green salad leaves ('salade verte') on a white plate, lightly coated with dressing or sauce. The salad consists of about 7 visibly individual leaves or leaf fragments, spread flat and not piled. The leaves vary in size but generally appear small to medium, roughly 5-7 cm in largest dimension each. The leaves are thin and have a low density typical of lettuce. The dressing adds a very thin visible coating, not bulk or volume. There is no indication of hidden leaves beneath or layered depth beyond what is visible. Comparing to the plate size and the faint sauce marks around, this portion looks quite small, about a few leaf fragments rather than a serving bowl or heap of salad. Given typical lettuce leaf density (about 0.15 g/cm3) and the approximate leaf area and thickness (around 1-2 grams per average leaf), plus a slight addition for the coating of sauce, the total portion weight is relatively low. Visually, this portion seems closer to a garnish or small side salad portion. Taking care not to overestimate and applying the known light weight of lettuce leaves, I estimate the total weight of the 'salade verte avec sauce' on the plate to be about 15 grams."

The target food item is 'vinaigre balsamique'. Visually, the vinaigre balsamique is seen as a dark brown liquid poured over the salad inside a small white bowl. The bowl contains several vegetables—radish slices, tomato chunks, pieces of apple, onion slices, and green leafy lettuce. The vinaigre balsamique covers the top layer of these ingredients but does not pool heavily at the bottom, indicating a light drizzle rather than a thick serving. Given that vinaigre balsamique is a dense, viscous liquid but the amount visible here is only a thin, glossy coverage with small thicker drops and streaks on the salad vegetables and the bowl edges, the volume looks minimal. Taking into account the surface area covered and the depth (thin layer and few visible droplets), and comparing it with the size of the bowl (roughly 12-15 cm diameter plate visible for scale), the vinaigre balsamique quantity is well under 20 grams. A conservative, evidence-based visual estimate leads to approximately 10 grams of vinaigre balsamique present in this serving."

Step 1: Visually identify the target food item 'mayonnaise thomy' in the image. The mayonnaise is located in the upper left corner of the plate as a single small dollop of creamy white substance next to the white asparagus. Step 2: Dimension analysis shows the mayonnaise dollop is roughly the size of a small spoonful, approximately 3-4 cm wide, with a noticeable height or thickness about 1.5 cm, giving it a small volume. Comparing it with the asparagus pieces which are about 10-12 cm long, the mayonnaise portion looks like a modest serving typically used as a condiment. Step 3: Considering density, mayonnaise is a dense, creamy condiment with density close to 1 g/cm3, so volume estimation converts nearly directly into weight. Step 4: Portion size calibration for a dollop this size usually ranges between 15-25 grams, but visually appears on the smaller end of this range. Step 5: Cross-validation and error prevention confirm that larger estimates would overestimate the size as the dollop is small. Therefore, a conservative estimate is about 18 grams, reflecting a moderate but not large portion of mayonnaise. Step 6: Final check: The weight feels reasonable given the size relative to asparagus on the plate and condiment appearances commonly served. Thus, the estimated mayonnaise thomy portion weighs approximately 18 grams."

The target food item is mayonnaise. In the image, the mayonnaise appears as a single swirl-shaped dollop on the left side of the plate. It is a concentrated portion with a height and volume typical of a small serving of sauce. Comparing it to the plate size and surrounding foods (notably the slice of tortilla and grilled aubergine slices), it occupies a small space approximately 4-5 cm long, roughly 2 cm wide, and about 1.5-2 cm in height based on texture and shadow. Mayonnaise is dense, with a high fat content, so the weight is relatively high for its volume. This small dollop portion likely weighs between 20 and 30 grams. Considering the shape and typical serving spoon size, I estimate the mayonnaise weight on the plate is about 25 grams."

The image shows a transparent glass bottle filled partially with shelled peanuts (cacahuètes). The bottle appears to be an average size, roughly comparable to a small condiment or beverage bottle, around 15 cm tall. The peanuts fill about one-fourth of the bottle volume. Visible peanuts are whole or halved and appear densely packed but not tightly compressed. Each peanut kernel is roughly 2-3 cm in length and about 1 cm thick. Given the density of shelled peanuts (approx. 0.6-0.7 g/cm³) and estimating the total peanut volume as approximately 50-60 cm³ based on the fill level and bottle diameter, the total mass of the peanuts corresponds roughly to 35-45 grams. Applying a conservative estimate to avoid overestimation, I estimate the weight of the cacahuètes to be 40 grams."

The image shows a square plate with four food items: two folded wraps, diced tomato pieces, chunks of avocado, and scrambled or finely chopped cooked egg pieces. The target food item is 'oeuf' (egg). The egg portion is on the lower left side of the plate, appearing as a loose pile of small flakes or curds, about 6-7 cm by 4-5 cm in visible surface area. The egg is cooked and broken into small pieces, with some texture indicating light fluffiness but also some density. The layer of egg is shallow, roughly estimated visually at about 0.5 to 1 cm thick. Comparing the pile size to the wrap in the upper left corner helps, as the wrap is a standard-size tortilla—around 20-22 cm in diameter. The egg portion appears roughly one-fifth to one-sixth the size of the wrap surface area. Considering the thinness and sparse packed nature of the egg, it is relatively light. Taking density into account (cooked eggs are dense but less so than meat, more than cooked vegetables), I estimate the egg portion visually weighs between 30 and 40 grams. A mid-value estimate of 35 grams is reasonable given the visual volume and common cooked egg density. This is consistent with a lightly filled scrambled egg portion of about half an egg, which matches the visual quantity on the plate."

The image shows a single cookie placed on a granite countertop, which provides a comparable scale reference. The cookie is irregularly shaped, roughly about 7 to 8 cm in diameter based on typical granite pattern sizes. It appears to be relatively thick, approximately 1.5 cm in height, with visible chocolate chunks embedded on the surface. The texture suggests a dense but slightly airy baked good. Considering the visible thickness, overall surface area, and density typical of chocolate chip cookies, the weight is unlikely to exceed 50 grams. A conservative estimate for this cookie, balancing its visible size and density, is around 45 grams."

The target food item is 'vinaigre', which is a liquid dressing visible as a light grainy mustard-like drizzle over the vegetables in the bowl. The vinaigre is spread thinly across the surface of the carrot and tomato sections, with visible grainy mustard seeds dispersed in small quantities. It does not form a visible pool or thick layer, but rather a light coating. Compared to the size of the bowl and the volume of the solid ingredients (carrots, tomatoes, cucumber, and sérac cheese), the visible vinaigre appears to be approximately 1-2 tablespoons in total volume. Considering that vinegar with mustard has a density close to water (~1g/ml), 1 tablespoon equals about 15 ml or 15 grams, and 2 tablespoons would be about 30 grams. Since the vinaigre is lightly applied and not pooled, the estimation should be closer to 15 grams, potentially up to 20 grams to account for some absorption and thicker spots. The surrounding solid foods provide a clear scale as the bowl size is medium and the vinaigre occupies minimal volume. Therefore, the estimate for vinaigre weight in this portion is 18 grams."

The target food item is mayonnaise, which is visible as a spread on the slice of pain bis bread on the left side of the sandwich. The bread slice is about the size of a typical hand-held sandwich slice, roughly 12 cm long and 7 cm wide. The mayonnaise layer is evenly spread but thin, covering the entire surface with no visible clumps or thick spots. Based on visual inspection, the spread appears to be about 1 to 2 mm thick. Mayonnaise is dense but spreadable, so a thin even layer over this surface area translates to a small weight. Estimating the area as approximately 84 cm2 (12 cm x 7 cm) and multiplying by thickness (~0.15 cm), the volume is roughly 12.6 cm3. Given mayonnaise density close to 1 g/cm3, the weight is about 12-13 grams. Considering minor variations and thinning at edges, a safe estimate is 12 grams for this mayonnaise portion."

STEP 1: VISUAL IDENTIFICATION. The target food is ""pain"" (bread). The image shows one slice of whole-grain or brown bread, roughly oval in shape, placed on a plate with Nutella spread on top. The slice is fully visible, not layered or cut. STEP 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS. The bread slice occupies about half the plate's surface. Compared to the spoon handle and the berries (strawberries and raspberries), the slice is roughly 12 cm long, 8 cm wide, and about 1.5 cm thick. The thickness is based on the visible side edge of the slice, which appears moderately thick for a slice of bread but not bulky. STEP 3: DENSITY CONSIDERATIONS. Bread is a porous, light to medium density food. Whole-grain slices have more density than white bread but still remain fairly light. Typical density for such bread is about 0.3 to 0.4 g/cm³. STEP 4: PORTION SIZE CALIBRATION. Using volume: approximate volume = length × width × thickness = 12 cm × 8 cm × 1.5 cm = 144 cm³. Using a density around 0.35 g/cm³, estimated weight = 144 × 0.35 = 50.4 g. Considering crust and air pockets, plus some natural variation, a range of 45-55 grams is reasonable. STEP 5: CROSS-VALIDATION. The bread slice looks like a standard slice of a baguette-style or artisanal bread, typically weighing about 45-55 grams per slice, which aligns with the volume-based calculation. The Nutella spread is not included in the weight as per instructions. STEP 6: FINAL CHECK. The estimated weight around 50 g makes sense; it is consistent with the slice thickness and visible size relative to objects in the image. No overestimation is detected. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the bread slice (pain) to be 50 grams."

The target food item is ""oeuf au plat"" (fried egg). Visually, the fried egg is located on the lower left side of the plate. It is a single intact egg with an orange yolk and cooked egg white around it. The egg covers a surface area approximately similar to half the width of the plate. Comparing the egg to the other food items such as cherry tomatoes and the feta cheese block, it appears to be a standard large egg size. The thickness of the egg white seems uniform but relatively thin, slightly raised around the edges. Fried eggs like this usually weigh less than raw eggs because some water is lost in cooking but mostly the whole egg is visible here without missing parts. Based on visual size and typical volumetric density, an average fried egg (large size) is approximately 50 grams. There are no additional toppings or thick batter hiding weight, so no adjustments for hidden volume are necessary. Thus, the estimation for the ""oeuf au plat"" is 50 grams."

The target food item is 'avocat'. In the image, the avocado is located on the top right section of the galette wrap. It consists of two slices, each about 7-8 cm long and roughly 2.5-3 cm wide. The thickness of the avocado slices appears to be around 1 cm. The avocado is fresh, with skin removed, showing a dense, creamy texture. Comparing the avocado slices to the known size of the fork on the right (standard dinner fork ~18 cm), the size and thickness are consistent with typical avocado slices. The avocado density is moderate, considering it is mostly water and fat. Given these dimensions, I estimate the total volume of avocado is about 40-45 cubic centimeters. Given that avocado density is roughly 0.96 g/cm³, the avocado weight should be approximately 38-44 grams. Considering some visual shrinkage/spacing between slices, a conservative but reasonable estimate is about 40 grams."

The image shows a single croissant au chocolat held in one hand, on a paper wrapper. The croissant is approximately the length of the palm and fingers excluding the thumb, roughly 12-14 cm long and about 6-7 cm wide at its widest point. The croissant has a visible folded, layered texture with a slightly puffed appearance indicating some thickness around 3-4 cm. It has a light golden brown color with some crunchy nut-like toppings on the surface. The croissant is partially eaten on one end, revealing a flaky pastry texture with a visible chocolate filling inside. Croissants are pastry items with moderate density because of the butter layers but can appear bigger due to air layers. Considering the visible size, thickness, texture, and partial bite, the weight is less than a full-sized bakery large croissant but more than a mini one. Standard medium croissants usually weigh between 70-90 grams. The nut topping and chocolate filling add slight extra weight. Given these considerations, I estimate the croissant au chocolat here weighs approximately 80 grams."

The image shows a single small yogurt container with the label indicating 'yogourt figue sans sucre' (fig yogurt without sugar). The container is placed on a wooden table alongside a fork which offers a size reference. The yogurt container appears to be a standard single-serving size, approximately 7 cm in height and about 6 cm in diameter, consistent with typical dairy yogurt pots. The yogurt fills the container close to the top, indicating a nearly full portion with minimal empty space visible at the top. Considering typical densities for yogurt and common packaging sizes for unsweetened fruit-flavored yogurts in Switzerland, such containers typically hold around 125g to 150g of product. There is no visible indication that the container is partially eaten or missing any contents. Given the visual evidence and the standard size of such yogurt pots, I estimate the weight of the 'yogourt figue sans sucre' to be approximately 150 grams."

The target food item is 'galette wraps', and the image shows one galette wrap flat on a blue plate with various toppings. The wrap is a single thin flatbread with a visible diameter approximately equal to the fork length nearby, which is about 18-20 cm. The galette wrap appears thin, with a visible surface covered in a thin layer of demi crème acidulée. Its thickness is minimal, roughly 1-2 mm, consistent with thin flatbread products. There is no folding or stacking, so volume is that of a single thin layer. Given the flat, large spread and thinness, the galette wrap's density is relatively low, similar to thin wheat-based flatbreads. Typical weights for standard whole grain or wheat galette wraps of this size range from about 60 to 70 grams. Visual evidence confirms this is a full wrap, not torn or partial, and its dimension matches typical portion sizes. Therefore, based on direct size comparison with the plate and fork, and the flatness observed, I estimate the galette wrap weighs approximately 65 grams."
