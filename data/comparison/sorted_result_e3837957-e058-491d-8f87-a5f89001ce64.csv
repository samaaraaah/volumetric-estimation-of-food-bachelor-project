The 'délice tomate mozzarella' consists of alternating slices of tomato and mozzarella, drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and sprinkled with herbs. From the image, there are approximately 5 slices of tomato and 5 slices of mozzarella. Each slice of tomato appears to be medium-sized and relatively thin, likely weighing around 20 grams each, for a total of 100 grams of tomato. The mozzarella slices are thicker and denser, likely weighing around 25 grams each, for a total of 125 grams of mozzarella. Adding the olive oil and balsamic vinegar, which are minimal, would contribute only a few grams, but we will focus on the main components. Combining these, the total weight of the 'délice tomate mozzarella' is approximately 225 grams."

The image shows two rhubarb muffins on a plate, one round and one heart-shaped. Both muffins appear to be of similar size and density, with visible chunks of rhubarb. Based on their size relative to the plate, they are medium-sized muffins. A typical medium-sized muffin with fruit chunks like rhubarb would weigh approximately 80-100 grams each. Since there are two muffins, the total weight would be around 160-200 grams. However, as the task is to estimate the weight of the specified food item 'muffin à la rhubarbe' as a group, I will estimate the combined weight of both muffins to be 180 grams."
