The image shows a pizza with toppings of champignons (mushrooms), olives, and courgettes (zucchini). There are five slices visible, and the pizza appears to be medium-sized. A typical medium pizza slice weighs between 80-120g, depending on the thickness of the crust and the density of the toppings. The crust here is relatively thin, and the toppings are not overly dense. Based on this, I estimate each slice to weigh approximately 90g. With five slices visible, the total weight of the pizza would be approximately 450g."
