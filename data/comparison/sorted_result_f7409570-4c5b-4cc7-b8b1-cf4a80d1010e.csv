8japfq,pain aux noix,62.0,50.0,12.0,230.544061302682,0.018346813967251924,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/6900a2ca-84e1-4e77-93d3-c1286d205017,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'pain aux noix', which is the slice of walnut bread visible on the edge of the black plate. The slice appears to be about average thickness, around 2 cm, and roughly half of a typical small bread roll size, judging by the spoon and plate size. Walnut bread tends to be moderately dense due to the nuts and wholegrain content. A typical slice of this size in Swiss portion context weighs between 40 and 60 grams. Taking into account the density and visible size of this slice, with the nuts visible in the bread, I estimate the weight of this 'pain aux noix' slice to be around 50 grams."
8japfq,salade grecque,460.0,200.0,260.0,230.544061302682,2.949299664628132,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/6900a2ca-84e1-4e77-93d3-c1286d205017,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'salade grecque' in the image. It is served on a medium-sized black plate alongside a piece of walnut bread which we exclude from the weighing. The salad contains visible cubes of feta cheese, diced cucumbers, diced tomatoes, and pieces of black olives. The ingredients appear fresh and lightly mixed without excessive dressing. The portion nearly fills the plate, with pieces spanning an estimated 18 cm diameter. The salad has visible depth due to the layering of cubed vegetables and cheese, roughly around 3-4 cm thick considering the volume. Feta cheese is dense but only a part of the salad by volume, vegetables are less dense but compact. Typical Greek salad portion in Switzerland is smaller than US portions, and this seems to be a moderate portion. Estimating volumes and densities for mixed salad, this would translate to an approximate weight of 180 to 220 grams. Given the visual fullness and quantity of cheese and vegetables, I estimate the weight of the salade grecque to be about 200 grams."
8japfq,pizza aux légumes,258.0,70.0,188.0,188.0,1.1960939041231011,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/794f61b2-f5f2-414d-bd5e-8ddaefed8b0f,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a slice of vegetable pizza on a standard-sized white plate. The pizza slice has roasted vegetables such as eggplant, zucchini, carrots, and bell pepper, along with tomato sauce and melted cheese on a relatively thin crust. The slice is roughly one eighth of a small to medium pizza, typically about 20 cm long and 10 cm wide at the crust. The crust is moderately thick and the amount of cheese and vegetables is moderate but spread unevenly. Considering the density of cooked vegetables and cheese, plus the dough crust, a full small pizza would weigh approximately 500-600 grams. Therefore, this single slice should weigh between 60-75 grams. Given it has a moderate amount of toppings and some visible thick crust, I estimate the weight of this single pizza slice at about 70 grams."

The image shows peeled and sliced pieces of raw kohlrabi (colrave crue) arranged on a plastic container lid. I count around 20 medium-sized slices. Each piece looks roughly triangular or wedge-shaped with an estimated average size of about 5 cm in length and roughly 1.5 cm in thickness based on the visible dimensions relative to the container lid, which seems roughly 20 cm by 15 cm. Kohlrabi is dense and crunchy, similar in density to raw cabbage or turnip, so each slice likely weighs around 15 grams on average. Multiplying 20 pieces by approximately 15 grams gives about 300 grams. Given there might be slight size variation, I estimate a range of 270 to 330 grams and select 300 grams as a reasonable estimate for the total raw kohlrabi weight shown, excluding container weight."
xjvrtk,myrtilles,200.0,20.0,180.0,180.0,0.8877490629315447,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/4d153e2f-e2dc-478b-80de-472793d5b51e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries) in a small glass jar containing yogurt and blueberries on top. The blueberries are clearly visible; I count approximately 16-18 individual berries piled on top of the yogurt. Each blueberry is medium-sized, roughly 1.5-2 cm in diameter. Given the density and typical weight of a single blueberry (about 1.2 grams), the total weight of the blueberries is roughly 16 pieces × 1.2 grams = about 19-20 grams. There is little hidden volume since the blueberries sit mostly on top. Considering the Swiss portion sizes and no visible excess or additional blueberries hidden deeper, a medium portion estimation of 20 grams is appropriate."
xjvrtk,ananas,200.0,380.0,180.0,180.0,0.8877490629315447,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/b41068f9-5a0e-4c11-bf1b-7389d3917889,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a bowl filled with chunks of fresh pineapple (ananas). First, I identify approximately 11 visible pieces of pineapple of varying sizes. Each piece appears to be medium-sized, roughly 4-6 cm in length and about 2-3 cm thick. Pineapple is a dense fruit with high water content, so it is relatively heavy for its size. Considering the bowl size relative to the pieces, and comparing to a standard small bowl, I estimate each piece weighs between 30 and 40 grams. Multiplying by 11 pieces gives a range around 330 to 440 grams. The portion looks like a medium to slightly large serving for Swiss portion standards. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the pineapple chunks to be about 380 grams."
2ahgvr,porridge salé,48.0,220.0,172.0,172.0,0.20359045176563426,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a35f3211-3b33-4826-97b8-3af69655dada,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small glass jar with a metal lid containing the 'porridge salé'. The jar is roughly the size of a standard jam jar, about 7cm wide at the top as indicated by the lid diameter marking. The porridge fills about 70-80% of the jar's volume. Assuming the jar is about 8-9cm tall and cylindrical, the total volume of the jar is around 300 ml. Given the porridge density is close to that of cooked oats (about 1 g/ml), this indicates the porridge inside weighs nearly as much as its volume in grams. Since the jar is not completely full, the actual porridge content is about 210-240 grams. Considering the porridge is fairly dense and thick, without air gaps, I estimate the weight of the porridge to be approximately 220 grams."
8japfq,tiramisu,76.0,230.0,154.0,154.0,0.2886170842375222,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/a184bb38-7d49-4c95-a49c-63140f9c16c7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single serving of tiramisu in a clear plastic container next to a standard metal teaspoon for scale. The container diameter is approximately 8-9 cm, typical for single-serve desserts. The tiramisu appears to be filled to about 4-5 cm depth. Given the structure of tiramisu, layers include mascarpone cream, soaked ladyfingers, and cocoa powder topping, which contribute moderate density but some airy texture from the cream. Taking the volume roughly as a cylinder (8.5 cm diameter × 4.5 cm height), the approximate volume is around 255 cm³. Considering tiramisu's density is roughly 0.9 g/cm³ due to cream and soaked cake, the estimated weight is about 230 grams. This aligns with typical individual tiramisu portions in Swiss serving sizes."
2ahgvr,humus,45.0,190.0,145.0,145.0,0.16090451765634248,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/db02ddb8-4bbb-4f48-bc32-55a1cde35ba5,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a rectangular plastic container filled with hummus. The container is resting on a flat surface, and judging by the hand shadow size and table surface, the container is small, typically about 10-12 cm in length, 6-7 cm in width, and around 4-5 cm deep. The hummus fills the container roughly 70-80% full. Considering density, hummus is fairly dense and creamy, close to 1 g/cm³. Estimating volume: around 10 cm × 6 cm × 4 cm = 240 cm³ total volume. 80% filled would be approximately 190-200 cm³ (or grams, since 1 cm³ ~1 gram for hummus). This gives a reasonable estimate between 180 and 200 grams. Given the visual fullness and Swiss portion context (moderate size), I estimate the weight of the hummus to be approximately 190 grams."
m4egh2,pâtes,340.0,150.0,190.0,144.64444444444445,1.593016374038272,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/7e7c07da-f8a5-4c6a-96b0-28284727895f,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'pâtes' (pasta). The image shows a plate of cooked pasta with a fried egg and ketchup on top, but I will only focus on the pasta. The pasta type appears to be a mixture of two shapes: fusilli (spiral) and curly instant noodles. The pasta forms a visible layer covering most of a standard rectangular plate (approximately 20-25 cm long). The portion looks fairly thick, about 2-3 cm deep, as the pasta is piled slightly but not too much. Compared to the size of the plate and considering the Swiss portion context, this is a medium-sized serving of pasta. Cooked pasta is dense and compact, so the weight is higher than it looks for the volume. A rough estimate per visual volume is around 150 g for this portion, as the noodles occupy about half of the plate area with moderate depth."
m4egh2,oeufs,90.0,95.0,5.0,144.64444444444445,0.01109686328664431,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/7e7c07da-f8a5-4c6a-96b0-28284727895f,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'oeufs' (eggs). In the image, I see two fried eggs placed on top of a bed of cooked pasta. The eggs appear fully cooked with visible yolks and white spread over the pasta. Each fried egg in a Swiss portion context typically weighs about 45-50 grams due to the size and cooking method which causes some water loss. Considering two eggs, I count exactly two distinct fried eggs, with some slight spreading and overlap but no evident missing parts. The eggs look normal-sized, not jumbo or small. Therefore, combined weight should be around 90-100 grams. I select the middle value of this range as a medium portion and estimate the total weight of the two fried eggs as approximately 95 grams."
m4egh2,ketchup,20.0,18.0,2.0,144.64444444444445,0.0009863878477017164,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/7e7c07da-f8a5-4c6a-96b0-28284727895f,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is ketchup, which is visibly spread as red sauce drizzled over the fried egg on top of the pasta. The ketchup is not in a separate portion but applied as lines on the egg, with some drizzle slightly extending onto the pasta. There is no large pool or deep volume of ketchup, indicating a relatively small amount. Comparing to the size of the fried egg (one whole egg, roughly 50 grams cooked) and the pasta, the ketchup lines are thin and sparse. Typically, such a drizzle covers approximately 1-2 tablespoons at most, where 1 tablespoon of ketchup weighs around 15 grams. Given the thin coverage, a reasonable estimate is about 15-20 grams total ketchup, favoring the lower end due to thin spread. Therefore, the estimated weight of the ketchup on this plate is about 18 grams."
8japfq,tarte aux épinards,230.0,90.0,140.0,140.0,0.7940422173998817,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/344e838c-6f09-45ef-a77e-75e5845ea1a0,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows three slices of spinach quiche ('tarte aux épinards') in a bowl, with visible egg custard, spinach, and cheese topping on a pastry crust. Each slice appears to be of average size, roughly 6-7 cm long and 3-4 cm wide, with a depth of about 2.5 cm based on visible thickness and typical tart dimensions. The filling is dense with cooked spinach and egg custard, which are fairly dense ingredients, plus a layer of melted cheese which adds weight. The crust is also visible with a standard thickness. Considering the density of cooked spinach mixed with eggs and cheese, and the standard thickness of the crust, each slice likely weighs between 80-100 grams. Since three slices are together, but the estimate is for one slice specifically, I will estimate one slice weighs about 90 grams, a medium portion in Swiss context. Therefore, the estimated weight of one slice of tarte aux épinards is 90 grams."
8japfq,salade verte,30.0,27.0,3.0,132.97881355932205,0.0022193726573288618,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/d3483c57-c2e2-4657-825f-52070e3da0b8,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'salade verte' which appears as light green leafy lettuce on the plate. Visually, the salade verte occupies roughly one quarter of a small to medium-sized plate, next to the larger portion of potato salad and a smaller portion of cottage cheese. The lettuce leaves are loose with some volume but low density since lettuce is light and mostly air. Comparing to the knife size and the plate diameter (roughly 22-24 cm), the pile of leaves looks to have a surface area of about 10x7 cm and a depth around 2-3 cm, so the volume is moderate but the density is low. Given the nature of salad leaves, the density is about 0.15-0.2 g/cm3. Estimating volume at approximately 140-160 cm3 and multiplying by density, I get a weight range around 21-32 grams. Considering this is a fairly typical Swiss portion size and the salad is not overly packed, I estimate a medium serving weight of 27 grams for the salade verte."
8japfq,cottage cheese,82.0,100.0,18.0,132.97881355932205,0.03639771158019333,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/d3483c57-c2e2-4657-825f-52070e3da0b8,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a white plate with three distinct food items: a portion of cottage cheese, a serving of potato salad (salade de pomme de terre), and some green salad (salade verte). The target food item is cottage cheese, located at the top right of the plate as a small mound of white curds. Visually, the cottage cheese portion occupies roughly a quarter of the plate's surface in that corner and has some visible depth—likely about 2-3 cm thick. Comparing its size to the size of the lettuce leaves and potato salad chunks on the plate, the cottage cheese portion appears moderate but not large. Cottage cheese has a relatively high water content and moderate density, so the volume to weight ratio is roughly 1:1 (i.e., 1 ml ~ 1 g). Estimating the cottage cheese volume as approximately a small handful, or about 100-110 ml, fits visually with typical Swiss portion sizes, where portions tend to be moderate. Given these observations, a reasonable weight estimate for the cottage cheese on this plate is approximately 100 grams."
8japfq,salade de pomme de terre,360.0,190.0,170.0,132.97881355932205,1.509173406983626,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/d3483c57-c2e2-4657-825f-52070e3da0b8,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a white plate with three distinct food portions: cottage cheese (small white curds) in the top right, green salad leaves on the left side, and potato salad (salade de pomme de terre) occupying the lower half of the plate. The potato salad consists of chopped boiled potatoes mixed with onion, herbs, and a light dressing. For visual scaling, the plate is a standard small lunch plate, approximately 23 cm diameter, and the potato salad portion covers about a third of the plate surface with a moderate thickness. The potatoes appear roughly 1-3 cm chunks, and the pile is thick enough to estimate density close to firm cooked potatoes with some dressing. Potato salad is dense, so it weighs more than it looks compared to loose leafy food. Given Swiss portion sizes, this looks like a medium serving. Typical medium Swiss potato salad portions range from about 150g to 220g. Considering the visible volume and density, I estimate the potato salad portion here to be approximately 190 grams."
8japfq,"pizza champignons, olives, courgettes",183.0,54.0,129.0,129.0,0.5821414480173605,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/9ac9736b-e0d1-4862-9981-1f47f8109d18,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with five slices of pizza topped with mushrooms, black olives, and courgettes. The pizza looks medium-thin crust with typical toppings spread evenly. The full pizza would typically weigh around 300-350 grams, but there is one slice missing, so about five-sixths remains on the plate. Each slice thus weighs approximately 55-60 grams. The toppings (champignons, olives, courgettes) proportionally cover the pizza surface but are light compared to the dough and cheese. Visually estimating, the vegetable toppings represent approximately 15-20% of the total pizza weight. Taking a 325 gram total pizza as a reference, 20% corresponds to about 65 grams total vegetable toppings. Since five slices are present, the toppings on the visible pizza amount to approximately 54 grams. This aligns with the visual coverage and density: mushrooms and courgettes are moderately dense, olives smaller but dense too. Therefore, the total weight of the pizza champignons, olives, courgettes visible on the plate is estimated at 54 grams."
wrah5h,riz,93.0,220.0,127.0,127.0,0.2912556717301243,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/5e117510-fc82-4a06-a502-12983d55aac5,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'riz' (rice). The rice is located at the bottom left on the plate and occupies roughly one-third of the plate's surface. The rice portion is cooked, appearing fluffy and slightly compact but not densely packed. Comparing the rice to the other foods (ratatouille and soufflé au fromage) and considering the standard French/Swiss portion size, this looks like a medium portion. The plate diameter can be assumed to be around 22 cm (standard small plate), and the rice depth, based on volume, is about 2 cm on average. Given that cooked white rice density is about 130-140 g per 100 ml, I estimate the rice volume to be approximately 150-170 ml, corresponding to roughly 200-240 grams. Given the visual evidence here, I estimate the riz portion weighs about 220 grams, aligning well with Swiss moderate portions."
8japfq,salade mêlée,71.0,75.0,4.0,120.67073170731706,0.007003353718682186,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/4dd7eb9a-2586-49a7-a9f6-8c88409f0e9f,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'salade mêlée', which is located at the top half of the plate, consisting mostly of leafy greens and a few small cherry tomatoes. Step 1: The leaves appear fresh and unprocessed, with some curly endive and spinach visible. There are about 3 visible cherry tomatoes, which add to the weight but are minor. Step 2: Compared to the plate (standard medium-sized dinner plate around 25-27 cm diameter), the salad takes up roughly one-third of the plate area. The greens are loosely piled, so depth is around 3-4 cm at maximum. Step 3: The salad greens are very light, with low density. The tomatoes have moderate density. Step 4: Estimating typical Swiss salad mixed portions, a small to medium salad plate serving is around 50 to 90 grams. Given the volume and leafy nature, I'd place this as a medium portion, closer to 70-80 grams. Step 5: Cross-validating, salads tend to be underestimated if only volume is considered but given the visible size and number of leaves, 75 grams is a reasonable estimate. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'salade mêlée' to be about 75 grams."
8japfq,gratin de légumes,309.0,150.0,159.0,120.67073170731706,1.2115555336358257,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/4dd7eb9a-2586-49a7-a9f6-8c88409f0e9f,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'gratin de légumes', which is visibly on the bottom left portion of the plate. Step 1 (Visual Identification): The gratin de légumes consists of visible slices of cooked eggplant, bell pepper strips, and some melted cheese in a tomato-based sauce, all mixed together. It seems to cover approximately one-third of the plate, slightly piled but relatively thin in depth without excessive layering. Step 2 (Dimension Analysis): The plate is a standard medium-sized plate (about 24 cm diameter). The gratin section covers roughly a 9 cm by 9 cm area. The depth estimate, considering a gratin is somewhat dense but not thick, is around 1.5 to 2 cm. Step 3 (Density Considerations): Cooked vegetables with tomato sauce and melted cheese are moderately dense, so the estimated density is close to 0.9 to 1.1 g/cm3. Step 4 (Portion Size Calibration): Calculating volume as 9 cm x 9 cm x 2 cm = 162 cm3. Multiplying by average density (~1 g/cm3) gives around 160 grams. Considering some moisture loss and shrinkage typical for gratin vegetables and the moderate cheese presence, I set an internal range from 130 to 180 grams. Given portion size appears moderate, I estimate toward middle range about 150 grams. Step 5 (Cross-Validation): This matches expectations for a Swiss portion of gratin de légumes, not over-abundant but a full serving. Overall, my estimate for the weight of the gratin de légumes is 150 grams."

The target food item is 'gruyère', which is clearly visible on the right side of the plate as a rectangular block. This piece of gruyère appears to be about 1.5 cm wide, 6 cm long, and approximately 1 cm thick, based on comparison with the salad leaves and the plate diameter. Gruyère is a dense cheese with an approximate density of 3.1 g/cm³. Estimating the volume as 1.5 cm × 6 cm × 1 cm = 9 cm³, the weight calculation is roughly 9 cm³ × 3.1 g/cm³ = 27.9 grams. Given Swiss portion sizes tend to be somewhat smaller, and the piece looks like a medium-sized serving of cheese, I estimate the weight of the gruyère to be about 28 grams."
8japfq,gratin de pâtes,295.0,160.0,135.0,119.4927536231884,0.9820724008680213,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/0e719126-b22f-4bbc-8c2f-83c1cd41a712,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'gratin de pâtes', which is located on the left side of the plate. Visually, the gratin occupies roughly one-third of the plate surface. The plate appears to be a standard small Swiss side plate, approximately 20-22 cm in diameter, so the gratin portion is about 8-10 cm across. Considering the orecchiette pasta shape, the pieces are fairly dense and layered with tomato-based sauce, cheese, and possibly some vegetables. The gratin is piled with some depth, visible as roughly 2-3 cm thick, and appears compact, not loose. Cooked pasta gratins are heavy due to the moisture and cheese content. Based on typical Swiss portion sizes and the visible volume, a small to medium portion weight is expected. A small portion of gratin might be around 120g, while a larger portion could be 180-200g. Given that this is a moderate serving, I estimate the gratin de pâtes weighs about 160 grams."
8japfq,salade verte,50.0,22.0,28.0,119.4927536231884,0.03452357466956007,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/0e719126-b22f-4bbc-8c2f-83c1cd41a712,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'salade verte' (green salad). Looking at the image, the green salad portion is on the right half of the plate. It consists mainly of leafy greens, including lettuce and some arugula. The leaves are loosely piled with some volume but low density as salad greens are light. The portion covers a visible surface area of roughly half the right side of the plate and has a moderate thickness, possibly about 2-3 cm in height. Because salad greens are lightweight, even if the volume looks moderate, the actual weight will be low. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes, this salad looks like a small to medium portion appropriate as a side, and not overly dense or compacted. Based on a common density of fresh lettuce (about 15-20 g per 100 cm³) and estimating the volume visually as about 100-150 cm³ total, the weight range is approximately 15-30 grams. Given the visual cues and portion size, I estimate the weight of the salade verte at 22 grams, reflecting a moderate, realistic side salad portion in Swiss context."

The target food is 'demi pidé fromage-viande hachée,' which is half of a pide stuffed with cheese and minced meat. Visually, the folded half pide occupies most of the wooden board and is roughly rectangular, about 15 cm long and 10 cm wide. The thickness looks moderate, around 2-3 cm, accounting for the filling inside. The dough of pide is dense but not overly heavy, and the filling of cheese and minced meat is relatively dense and compact. Given the size and density, this half pide is likely to weigh between 200 and 270 grams. Since it's a medium portion size for a half pide, I estimate it closer to the middle-upper range, about 250 grams. I do not include the salad because the target food item is only the half pide. Therefore, the estimated weight is 250 grams."

The target food item is 'salade.' The salad is served in a small rectangular white bowl alongside a half pide on a wooden board. Visually, the salad contains mixed lettuce leaves, tomato wedges, and thin slices of red onion with a light dressing and ground pepper. The bowl size is roughly comparable to the width of the person's hand and the glass nearby, suggesting a small side portion. The visible volume indicates a shallow depth but with some hidden layers of leaves and vegetables. Considering the density of raw vegetables and the typical portion size of a small restaurant side salad in Switzerland, the salad weight would likely be between 70 and 120 grams, with a medium portion estimate around 90 grams being reasonable based on the bowl's volume and vegetable density."
p8a2w5,dahl de lentille,180.0,290.0,110.0,110.0,0.4882619846123496,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/2b1f4950-0235-432d-ae08-7210d431d3c1,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is the 'dahl de lentille' visible in the bowl. Step 1: Visual identification shows the dahl de lentille as the orange lentil stew mixed with visible chunks of carrots and onions. It occupies more than half of the bowl's volume and is layered above some white rice at the bottom. Step 2: Dimension analysis uses the bowl as a reference, which seems to be a standard small-medium kitchen bowl (~15 cm diameter, ~6-7 cm depth). The dahl de lentille appears to fill approximately 60-70% of the bowl's volume, roughly about 280-320 ml in volume, assuming the dahl is somewhat thick. Step 3: Density consideration notes that dahl de lentille, a cooked legume dish with vegetables, is relatively dense and moist with a density estimated near 1 g/ml. Step 4: Portion size calibration accounts for a medium Swiss portion, leading to an estimated range of 260-320 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation ensures no underestimation due to being mixed and somewhat thick. Therefore, a reasonable estimation weighing on the middle-to-upper middle of the range leads to about 290 grams for the dahl de lentille alone."

The target food item is 'patates rôties' (roasted potatoes). In the image, there are about 11 small whole roasted potatoes placed on the right side of the plate. These potatoes appear to be baby or new potatoes, with a wrinkled surface indicating roasting. Each potato is roughly the size of a large grape or small walnut, approximately 3-4 cm in length. A typical small roasted new potato weighs about 30-40 grams. Considering Swiss portion size, which tends to be smaller than US portions, and the average density of cooked potatoes, I estimate each potato weighs around 35 grams on average. Multiplying 11 potatoes by 35 grams gives about 385 grams. Given some slight variation in potato size and possible moisture loss from roasting, I will adjust slightly downward to account for typical portioning and visual volume. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the roasted potatoes on the plate to be approximately 370 grams."

The image shows a white plate containing several food items including roasted baby potatoes, a slice of raclette cheese, chopped endive, and chopped apple (pomme). The chopped apple pieces are clustered on the lower left side of the plate. I identify roughly 15-20 apple pieces of similar size. Considering the apple pieces are thin slices/chunks with skin, and the density of apple is moderate, I estimate each piece to weigh about 6-8 grams. The apple portion appears to represent roughly half of a small to medium apple. An average medium apple weighed peeled or chopped is around 150-180g, so half would be about 75-90g. Considering visual volume and Swiss smaller portion context, I estimate the total chopped apple weight to be around 80 grams."

The image shows a white plate containing four main items: roasted baby potatoes, a sliced endive salad, chopped apple pieces, and a solid piece of fromage à raclette cheese. The target food is the fromage à raclette. Visually, the cheese piece is roughly square-shaped, about 7 cm by 7 cm in surface area, and approximately 0.7 cm thick, judging by its edge thickness. It is a solid block without visible holes or air pockets, suggesting it is dense. Fromage à raclette is a semi-hard cheese with a typical density around 1.1 g/cm³. Calculating the approximate volume: 7 cm x 7 cm x 0.7 cm = 34.3 cm³. Multiplying the volume by density: 34.3 cm³ x 1.1 g/cm³ ≈ 38 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes that tend to be moderate, and allowing for slight variation in thickness or cutting, a reasonable estimate lies between 35 and 45 grams. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the fromage à raclette to be approximately 40 grams."

The image shows a white plate with several food items including roasted baby potatoes, a slice of raclette cheese, chopped endive, and chopped apple. The target food is 'endive'. Visually, the chopped endive occupies a moderate pile on the plate under the apple pieces. The pieces are thinly sliced, showing both the white and some yellow leaf parts, typical of Belgian endive. Considering the volume relative to the other items, the endive appears to cover about 1/5 of the plate's surface. In terms of depth, the chopped endive is thin but piled up, suggesting some volume hidden beneath the surface layer. Endive is a leafy vegetable with moderate density – more dense than lettuce but lighter than cooked vegetables. Estimating the volume roughly as a small handful, this would put the weight between 40 and 60 grams. Given the plate portion size consistent with Swiss meal norms, I lean towards the medium portion range around 50 grams. This takes into account the visible volume, density, and typical endive serving portions."

The image shows a rectangular plastic container filled with gratin de pâtes, specifically orecchiette pasta mixed with tomato sauce, small pieces of mushroom, cherry tomatoes, and some melted cheese. The container appears to be a typical small lunchbox size, roughly 15 cm long, about 10 cm wide, and the pasta fills the container to about 3-4 cm in height. The pasta is cooked and coated in sauce, contributing to weight density. Orecchiette pasta is fairly dense, and the sauce and cheese add moisture and weight. The portion looks medium-sized for a Swiss portion context, not overflowing but well filled. Based on the dimensions, volume, and density, I estimate the total weight of the gratin de pâtes to be in the range of 250-300 grams. Choosing a value near the middle of this range to account for some vegetables and sauce but no visible heavy additional ingredients, an estimate of 275 grams is reasonable."

The image shows one triangular slice of pizza on a white plate. The slice appears to be a thin-crust style with visible tomato sauce, melted cheese, and basil leaves. The slice's length spans about half the diameter of a standard dinner plate (approximately 23 cm), making the slice around 11-12 cm in length. The crust is thin and not heavily thickened, consistent with a lighter Italian-style pizza. The cheese and sauce coverage is moderate, indicating a balanced moistness without excess weight. Given the thinness of the crust and moderate toppings, a typical slice of this size and style in a Swiss portion context would weigh approximately 85 to 110 grams. Considering these factors and the visible size, my best estimate for the pizza slice weight is around 95 grams."

The image shows 27 small round cherry tomatoes placed on a white plate. Step 1: Visual Identification - I count 27 individual tomatoes, all of similar small size, typical for cherry tomatoes. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Cherry tomatoes generally measure about 2.5 to 3 cm in diameter. Using the plate as a reference, these tomatoes fit that expected size range. Step 3: Density Considerations - Tomatoes are dense with high water content but not heavy; an average cherry tomato weighs roughly between 15 and 20 grams. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Since all are relatively uniform in size and quantity, the total weight is approximated by multiplying count by average weight. Assuming an average weight per tomato of about 16 grams (mid-range for small Swiss portion cherry tomatoes), 27 tomatoes × 16 grams = 432 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The total seems reasonable given the size and that the tomatoes fill roughly half a medium plate. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the tomatoes to be approximately 430 grams."

The target food item is 'blé aux légumes.' In the image, this is the right portion on the plate composed of cooked wheat berries (blé) mixed with leafy greens and tomato sauce. The portion roughly covers about one third of the plate surface. Based on the plate diameter being a standard small dinner plate (around 22 cm), the blé aux légumes portion is approximately 10 cm by 7 cm in visible area, with an estimated depth of about 2.5 cm considering the moisture and volume of cooked grains with vegetables. Cooked wheat berries have a density similar to cooked grains, reasonably dense and compact. Vegetables and sauce add some volume without much density. Estimating volume around 175 cm3 and considering a density close to 1 g/cm3 for cooked grains with vegetables, the portion likely weighs around 170-190 grams. Given Swiss portion sizes tend to be smaller, and the visible portion seems moderately sized, I estimate the weight of the blé aux légumes in this image to be approximately 180 grams."

The target food item is 'omelette au fromage.' Visually, the omelette is positioned on the left side of the plate and appears to be a thick, folded egg dish with melted cheese inside or mixed in. It has an irregular shape but occupies a substantial portion of the plate's left side. Comparing it to the known size of the plate (standard dinner plate around 25-27 cm diameter), the omelette's area suggests a volume roughly equivalent to a small to medium Swiss portion. The thickness is about 2-3 cm as per the folds and visible height, indicating a dense, cooked egg texture with cheese. Considering that cooked egg omelettes with cheese have a density close to 0.9-1.1 g/cm3, and estimating the overall volume around 120-150 cm3, this gives a weight approximately between 110 to 160 grams. Given the portion seems moderate, leaning towards the medium size, the best estimate is close to the middle to upper middle of the range, about 140 grams. Thus, the omelette au fromage weighs approximately 140 grams."

The image shows a bowl with a mixture of pork and vegetables in a sauce, served over a base of rice noodles ('nouille de riz'). The target food item to estimate is the rice noodles. The noodles are partially covered by the other ingredients but visible around the edges and underneath. The noodles appear to be slender, flat rice noodles that are typical in Thai cuisine. Given the size of the bowl (medium-sized bowl), and the visible volume of noodles suggesting a layer of about 1.5 - 2 cm depth underneath the toppings, the rice noodles portion likely corresponds to a single serving. Noodles are dense but lightweight compared to meat and vegetables due to their structure. Visual volume alone suggests a medium Swiss portion size, smaller than US portions. An average cooked rice noodle portion in Switzerland is between 90 to 120 grams. Considering the visible quantity and accounting for some hidden volume under the toppings, I estimate the weight of the rice noodles to be approximately 105 grams."

The target food is 'mélange de porc et légumes façon thaï'. From the image, this portion is served atop a bed of rice noodles, so I focus solely on the pork and vegetable mixture on top. Visually, the mixture covers a circular area roughly 14-16 cm in diameter within the bowl and has a moderate height of approximately 3-4 cm, indicating a substantial volume. The mixture includes visible chunks of pork, broccoli florets, carrot pieces, red pepper strips, mushrooms, and some green peas, all coated in a creamy sauce. Pork is dense, and the cooked vegetables retain some density but are less heavy than meat. Considering the mixed nature and sauce, the overall density is moderate to high. Estimating volume approximately 200-250 ml, converting roughly to grams with a density slightly less than water (~0.9 to 1 g/ml) due to vegetables and sauce. Thus, the mixture likely weighs around 180 to 230 grams. Given the portion size and considering Swiss smaller portions, I settle on approximately 210 grams for the pork and vegetable mixture. This estimate excludes the noodles beneath, in line with instructions."
m4egh2,poulet + sauce curry,106.0,160.0,54.0,86.70207852193995,0.1411521010061156,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/1be0c018-c909-437a-bb34-9818f24a9b6a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'poulet + sauce curry,' which is clearly visible as two chicken strips covered in a yellow curry sauce lying on top of rice. For visual identification, I can see two sizeable pieces of chicken breast or tenderloin. They appear evenly coated with curry sauce. Comparing the chicken strips to the standard width and height of the rectangular glass container, which is likely around 15 cm in length and about 6-7 cm in width, each chicken strip seems to be approximately 12 cm long, 3 cm wide, and about 1.5-2 cm thick including sauce. This gives a moderate volume. The sauce adds some slight volume but is mostly on the surface and does not greatly increase weight beyond the chicken itself. Considering density, cooked chicken breast without bone usually weighs around 1.05 g/cm3. Given the relatively dense composition and compact shape, I approximate each strip’s weight around 70-90 grams with sauce. Two strips hence fall in the range of approximately 140-180 grams. Given the portion looks like a standard medium, not overly large nor very small, a midrange estimate is appropriate. Therefore, I estimate the 'poulet + sauce curry' weight as approximately 160 grams, excluding any container weight."

The image shows a clear rectangular glass container with three main food components: white rice (riz casimir), two pieces of chicken with curry sauce, and three green asparagus stalks. The target food is 'riz casimir', so I focus solely on the rice. The rice is positioned mostly on the right half of the container and appears to fill the base in a layer approximately 1.5 to 2 cm thick over the container floor. The container seems to be a standard lunchbox size, roughly 15 cm in length and 8-9 cm in width, giving the rice an estimated volume of around 180-200 cm³. Cooked rice has a density of approximately 0.8 g/cm³. Estimating conservatively, the total volume corresponds to about 150-160 grams of cooked rice. Given that Swiss portions tend to be smaller, and the rice is not piled high but rather flat, I assign a medium portion toward the lower-middle range of cooked rice weight. Therefore, I estimate the riz casimir portion weight as approximately 155 grams."

The target food item is 'asperges' (asparagus). In the image, there are three whole asparagus spears visible, lying side by side in a glass container. Each asparagus spear appears to be the size of typical Swiss asparagus, about 15-18 cm in length and relatively thick. The spears are steamed or cooked, which reduces some weight but they still retain density. Considering the average weight of one cooked asparagus spear to be roughly 25-30 grams, and counting three spears, the total weight would be approximately 75-90 grams. Given the slightly thicker appearance and factoring in visual estimation from the container size, I select a medium portion weight around 85 grams for these three asparagus spears."

The image shows two slices of tarte aux épinards (spinach tart) on a standard-sized dinner plate, approximately 24 cm in diameter. Each slice is about one-eighth of a whole tart, which corresponds to the visible portion size. The tart has a relatively thin crust and a dense spinach and egg filling with visible cheese or browned topping. Considering the thickness is about 1.5 to 2 cm, and the filling density is fairly compact given the cooked spinach and egg custard, this type of tart usually weighs around 80 to 100 grams per eighth slice in Swiss portions, which are typically smaller than US portions. Given two slices are on the plate, I estimate the combined weight is roughly 160 to 200 grams. Since the target is the tarte aux épinards, I estimate the total weight of both slices as served is about 180 grams."

The image shows a small glass containing freshly squeezed orange juice ('orange pressée'). The glass appears to be a shot glass or a small juice glass typically used in Swiss settings, about 6-7 cm in height and around 5 cm diameter. The glass is filled almost to the top, allowing us to estimate the volume visually. A typical small juice glass of this size holds approximately 100-120 ml of liquid. Given that orange juice density is close to water (1 g/ml), the volume in ml is a good proxy for weight in grams. The juice has visible pulp, but that doesn't significantly change density. Considering Swiss portions are usually smaller, and this is a single small glass serving, I estimate the weight of the 'orange pressée' to be approximately 110 grams."

The image shows a white bowl filled with fresh spinach leaves, small cherry tomato halves, sprouted seeds, and falafel balls. For the estimation, I focus solely on the fresh spinach leaves ('épinards frais'). Visually, the spinach covers the entire base of the bowl, with leaves overlapping and some partially covered by falafels and tomatoes. Fresh spinach leaves are relatively light and leafy, but here the portion looks moderately dense and compact given the bowl size, which is about the size of a small to medium salad bowl (approx. 18 cm width). The volume of spinach here looks like roughly 1 to 1.5 handfuls, typical for a small Swiss portion. Given typical fresh spinach density (~30 g per 100 ml volume), and estimating a compact volume of about 120-150 ml of leaves, the fresh spinach weight is likely between 35 and 45 grams. Since the leaves lay flat and are not loosely piled, I opt for a medium portion estimate around 40 grams."

The target food item is 'pousses de graines' which are visible in the center-left of the bowl. The sprouts appear as a small pile mixed with fresh spinach leaves and halved cherry tomatoes. By comparing to the standard size of the cherry tomatoes and spinach leaves, the sprouts form a cluster roughly 6 cm by 4 cm in area, with a thin layer depth of about 1.5 cm since sprouts are light and fluffy. Given the low density of sprouts, they weigh significantly less compared to volume. A typical density of sprouts is around 0.2g/cm3. The estimated volume is approximately 6 x 4 x 1.5 = 36 cm3. Multiplying volume by density gives about 7.2 grams. Considering some compactness in the cluster but light weight of sprouts, I round to about 7 grams. This is a small to medium portion size typical in Swiss context. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'pousses de graines' in the dish is approximately 7 grams."

Each fallafel appears to be about 3.5-4 cm in diameter, typical for homemade or small restaurant portions. Considering the size relative to the cherry tomatoes and spinach leaves, each fallafel is roughly 30-40 grams. Falafels are dense, fried chickpea-based foods which gives them a significant weight for their volume. Multiplying 8 fallafels by an average weight of about 35 grams each results in a total estimated weight of approximately 280 grams. This accounts for slight variations in size but does not include any plate or background items."

The target food item is 'tomates cerises' (cherry tomatoes). In the image, I see 6 cherry tomato halves, which visually correspond to about 3 whole cherry tomatoes. Each cherry tomato typically weighs between 15 to 20 grams for this size. Considering the perspective and slight depth, these tomatoes are fresh and reasonably dense. Multiplying 3 whole tomatoes by an average of 17 grams results in approximately 51 grams. Because this is a Swiss portion and the tomatoes appear medium-sized but not overly large, and some are halved likely reducing the visible volume a bit, I will place this estimate slightly conservatively in the middle of the weight range. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the cherry tomatoes to be around 50 grams."

The target food item is 'patates rôties' (roasted potatoes) located in the upper right of the bowl. There are roughly 6 visible small whole roasted baby potatoes, each approximately 3-4 cm in diameter. These potatoes appear cooked and roasted with some shrinkage but dense as potatoes retain density even after cooking. Comparing their size to the cheese slices and apple pieces, each potato likely weighs about 40-50 grams. Multiplying by 6 potatoes gives an estimated total weight range from 240 to 300 grams. Considering the portion size and visible volume, I judge this to be a medium portion, thus around the mid to lower end of this range is appropriate. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the patates rôties at approximately 260 grams."

The target food item is 'pommes' (apple pieces) in a bowl with other foods. Visually, the diced apple pieces are cut into small chunks roughly 2-3 cm in size and scattered over a medium portion of the bowl. There appear to be around 15-18 apple chunks visible, some overlapping. The apples have the skin on, which adds weight. Considering a Swiss portion context, apple pieces of this size typically weigh about 10-12 grams each. Estimating at around 16 chunks × 11 grams on average gives approximately 175 grams. The pieces are not very dense but firm, and there is some volume hidden under other ingredients, so accounting for that slightly increases the estimate. Overall, a reasonable estimate for the total weight of the apple pieces is about 170 grams."

The image shows a bowl containing several food items including patates rôties, morceau de fromage à raclette, endives, pommes, and noix. I focus only on the fromage à raclette which appears as two slices placed on top of the potatoes. Each slice is roughly rectangular with dimensions approximately 7 cm by 4 cm with a thickness around 0.5 cm. Raclette cheese is dense and firm, with an approximate density of 1.0 g/cm³. Estimating the volume of both slices combined: 7*4*0.5*2 = 28 cm³. Given the cheese density, this translates roughly to 28 grams. Considering slight variations in thickness and potential partial overlapping, I estimate the fromage à raclette weight to be around 28 grams."

The target food item is 'endives,' which are visible as chopped pale white and light green pieces mixed under and around the apple chunks and walnuts in the bowl. The bowl is medium-sized, and the endives appear to make up a thin layer underneath the other ingredients without much bulk. Given the visual comparison to the apple pieces (approximately 1-2 cm thick slices) and the roasted potatoes, the endives occupy roughly the equivalent of a small handful, likely chopped finely with some volume lost. Endives are fairly dense leafy vegetables, but since chopped and spread thinly, the total weight will be modest. Considering typical Swiss portion size context (smaller than US), I estimate the endives weight in this portion to be in the range of 40 to 60 grams. Balancing the visible quantity and density, a medium portion estimate of 50 grams is reasonable."

The target food item is 'noix' (walnuts). In the image, walnuts are scattered on top of apple slices and mixed with endive. I count roughly 10 walnut halves or pieces visible. Each walnut half typically weighs around 2.5 to 3 grams. Considering some pieces might be smaller and some possibly hidden under the apples, I estimate an average piece weight of 2.5 grams and account for a potential 20% hidden volume, leading to a total weight range of about 30-35 grams. Given the portion size and typical density of walnuts, I estimate the total weight of walnuts in the bowl to be approximately 33 grams."

The target food item is 'son d'avoine' (oat bran), which is mixed into a jar with yogurt, oats, chia seeds, honey, and almond puree. Visually, the oat bran is integrated into the mixture and not present as distinct large particles but rather as small, fine flakes dispersed throughout. The jar appears to be around 10-12 cm tall and about 7-8 cm in diameter. The total mixture fills approximately 3/4 of the jar. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes and visual density, oat bran is relatively dense, but given the mixture and partial distribution, the oat bran likely makes up about 1/4 to 1/3 of the mixed content in terms of volume. A small Swiss portion of oat bran typically weighs around 20-25 grams. Given the visual evidence of the amount and density in this jar, and that it is mixed in with other ingredients, I estimate the oat bran weight to be approximately 22 grams."

The image shows a glass jar filled with a mixture containing visible oat flakes ('flocons d'avoine'), yogurt, chia seeds, and other ingredients. The oat flakes are well distributed throughout the mixture. The jar is about medium-sized, and the visible depth suggests about 250-300 ml of content in total. Considering that the oat flakes are soaked and mixed with yogurt and other ingredients, their volume is expanded but their dry weight remains distinct. Typical dry oat flakes density is about 0.3-0.4 g/ml dry, but soaked oats absorb liquid and become heavier in volume but not weight. Judging by the visible quantity compared to the jar size, the oat flakes in this mixture likely correspond to a small-medium portion, around 40-50 grams dry weight. Given the Swiss portion context and the visible amount, I estimate about 45 grams for the 'flocons d'avoine'."

The target food item is 'graine de chia' (chia seeds) visible mixed throughout the creamy mixture in the jar. Step 1: The chia seeds are dispersed evenly throughout the visible portion, but there are no large clumps or concentrated servings—just typical distribution within the yogurt and oats blend. Step 2: The container is a small glass jar of about 250-300 ml volume, with other ingredients mixed in. The chia seeds appear as small black specks, and considering how much chia seeds absorb moisture and expand, the actual pure dry chia seed volume should be modest. Step 3: Chia seeds are dense and small; a tablespoon (about 12 grams) will look quite small, but here the amount looks to be less than a tablespoon, roughly around one teaspoon. Step 4: Considering the distribution and assuming around 1 teaspoon (ca. 5 grams) to 1 tablespoon max, and judging visually, this is likely closer to a teaspoon of chia seeds given how sparse they appear amidst the other ingredients. Step 5: So, estimating about 4 to 6 grams would be reasonable, choosing the mid-point of 5 grams as a balanced estimate. This is consistent with typical Swiss portion size, with no visible large clumps or piles indicating a larger weight."

The target food item is 'miel' (honey), which appears as a small layer of amber-colored liquid visible near the middle of the jar, surrounded by a creamy mixture of yogurt, oats, and chia seeds. The jar is a small glass container, roughly fitting in the palm of a hand, about 8-10 cm tall and 6-7 cm in diameter. The honey layer is thin and unevenly spread, roughly forming a band about 1.5 to 2 cm thick and covering a small surface area above a dense bottom layer. Given honey's high density (~1.4 g/cm³), even a small volume weighs notably. Visually, the honey volume seems very limited, approximately 10-15 ml in total volume, accounting for some spread irregularity and partial mixing. Applying density, this volume translates to roughly 14-21 grams. Considering this is a small healthy portion in a Swiss context, a safe estimate at the middle of the range is about 18 grams."

The target food is 'yogourt nature' visible as the main creamy base of the mixture inside the glass jar. The jar is about the size of a small dessert container, approximately 7 cm in diameter and 8-9 cm tall, and is filled almost entirely with the yogurt-based mix. The yogurt is mixed with small seeds and oats but appears to form the bulk of the mixture, likely representing about 80% of the volume. Given that yogurt has a density close to 1.03 g/ml, and estimating the volume of yogurt as roughly 250 ml to 300 ml inside the jar, the weight is likely between 250 to 310 grams. Considering this is a typical Swiss-sized portion, a medium portion estimate would be near the middle of the range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'yogourt nature' in this jar to be approximately 275 grams."

The target food is 'purée d'amande' in a jar containing a mixture of other ingredients like yogurt, oats, chia seeds, and honey. Visually, the almond purée appears as a brownish layer near the top center of the jar, partially embedded in the mixed content. The jar is relatively small, roughly the size of a 250 ml container. The almond purée layer looks to be around 2-3 cm in diameter and about 0.5-1 cm thick, considering some integration into other ingredients. Almond purée is dense and thick, so its weight is significant per volume. Estimating the visible volume to be approximately 10-15 ml translates roughly to about 10-15 grams, given the density close to that of nut butters (~1 g/ml). Considering possible minor mixing and partial hidden volume, a reasonable estimate is near the middle of that range. Therefore, the purée d'amande weight is estimated at approximately 13 grams."

The image shows a plate with cooked pâtes (tagliatelle or similar flat pasta) topped with a creamy sauce containing feta and tomatoes. The pasta occupies most of the visible area on the plate and is a medium portion typical in Swiss servings, smaller than US portions. The pasta strands are fairly flat and loosely piled, giving a sense of volume and thickness. Comparing the portion to the plate diameter, the pasta pile is about 15 cm wide and moderately thick, indicating a typical cooked volume. Cooked pasta is dense and compact, so the weight per volume is higher than for leafy or fluffy foods. Given the visual volume and typical density of cooked flat pasta, I estimate the pasta portion to weigh between 130 and 160 grams. Considering this looks like a medium Swiss portion, I choose approximately 145 grams."

The target food is 'feta' on a plate of pasta. The feta is mixed within a creamy sauce containing visible tomato pieces. The feta appears crumbled but is distributed in a thick layer on top of the pasta. The portion covers roughly a quarter of a standard medium-sized plate and looks to be fairly dense due to the presence of the creamy sauce plus feta cheese chunks. Given feta's typical density (dense cheese) and the visible volume (assuming about 2 to 3 cm depth), I estimate an average medium portion. Considering Swiss portion sizes, I estimate the feta weight to be approximately between 60 and 80 grams. Choosing the middle ground, I estimate about 70 grams of feta in this dish."

Considering the container is a typical individual yogurt pot, usually around 125 to 150 grams full, and judging by the remaining amount, roughly half remains. The yogurt itself is dense and creamy, so the weight corresponds closely to volume. Estimating that approximately 60-75 grams of banana yogurt remain in the container based on visual volume and standard small yogurt pot sizes under Swiss portion context. Therefore, the weight of the banana yogurt visible is about 70 grams."

The image shows two slices of toasted bread ('pain toast') on a small plate. Each slice is standard-sized sandwich bread, about 10 cm by 10 cm. Swiss portions of sliced bread are generally smaller than US slices. Each slice appears moderately thick, about 1.5 cm. Toasted bread loses some moisture but weight remains close to fresh bread size. A typical slice of sandwich bread weighs between 25-30 grams in Swiss portions. Since two slices are present, the total weight for both would be around 50-60 grams. The target food is only 'pain toast', so the weight corresponds to the combined two slices visible on the plate without any toppings considered. I estimate the weight of pain toast to be approximately 55 grams."

The target food is 'beurre' (butter) visible spread on two pieces of toast. Visually, the butter layer looks thin and uneven, with some patches more concentrated than others. Each slice of toast seems to have approximately 5 grams of butter based on typical spread thickness and coverage for Swiss portions, which are smaller than US portions. Given there are two slices with butter, the total butter amount on both is roughly 10 grams. There is no visible butter off the toast or in separate portions. The knife presence confirms spreading but no excess amounts visible. Therefore, the estimated weight of the butter is about 10 grams."

The target food item is 'miel' (honey). In the image, the honey is spread thinly on two slices of toasted bread. Each toast slice appears to have about a teaspoon to a tablespoon of honey distributed unevenly over the surface. Considering the size of the toast (standard small Swiss slice, roughly 10x10 cm) and the thin layer of honey, the total honey volume seems modest. Honey is dense (about 1.4 g/ml), so even a small volume weighs more than it looks. The visible amount of honey on both slices combined is approximately 1 to 1.5 tablespoons, which translates to about 20 to 30 grams. Given the thin spread and some gaps, I estimate the total weight of honey on the toast at about 25 grams."

Focusing only on the porridge, it forms the base and fills about 2/3 of the jar’s visible volume. The jar appears to be around 250-300 ml total capacity. The porridge is dense and moist, typical for cooked oats, so it has a density near 1 g/ml. Estimating the porridge volume in the jar as roughly 150-180 ml, it corresponds to about 150-180 grams. Taking into account the space occupied by the topping and potential small air gaps, I place the porridge portion at about 160 grams, which fits a typical Swiss moderate porridge portion size served in such a jar."

Visually, the almond purée is the light beige creamy substance on top of the walnuts and figs, spread thinly with a few streaks on the jar's inner surface. The amount appears small, likely less than a tablespoon. Considering a tablespoon of almond purée weighs about 16 grams, and this portion seems to be about half or slightly less, I estimate around 7 to 9 grams.

Counting the pieces carefully, there are about 5 to 6 visible fig pieces. The jar is small, and the fig pieces are chopped into small chunks approximately 2-3 cm in length. Dried figs are dense and compact, with a typical density around 0.7 to 0.9 g/cm3. Considering each piece roughly weighs between 5 to 7 grams, the total quantity appears medium-sized but not a full large portion.

I can count roughly 5 walnut halves clearly visible, with some possibly partially hidden due to layering. Each walnut half in typical portion sizes weighs about 2 to 3 grams. Given the layers and depth inside the jar, there might be slight overlap or hidden pieces, but no significant hidden volume. Considering the size of the jar (roughly a small jam jar, about 200-250 ml capacity) and the spread of walnuts on top, I estimate around 5 walnut halves totaling approximately 12-15 grams. Given the visible quantity and the density of walnuts, a 14-gram estimate seems reasonable for the whole visible amount of walnut halves."

The image shows a single banana being held by a hand, which provides a good size reference. The banana looks slightly overripe with some brown spots. Its length appears to be about 15-17 cm, which is typical for a small to medium banana size commonly found in Swiss portions, smaller than US standard bananas. Given the visible thickness and curvature, this banana is moderately sized but not large. A medium banana in Switzerland typically weighs around 100-120 grams including peel. Considering the visual size and density of the banana flesh, I estimate the banana's weight (excluding peel is not requested, so standard whole banana weight applies) to be approximately 110 grams."

The shrimp appear to be peeled and deveined, which is common for ready-to-eat skewers, so there is little to no shell weight included. Visually, each shrimp is roughly 3-4 grams in weight, considering their size and typical density of cooked shrimp. With two skewers and approximately 13 shrimp total, the combined weight is calculated as 13 shrimp × 3.5 grams average, resulting in about 45 grams.

A typical small bread roll in Swiss context, considering its size here, would weigh between 50 and 70 grams. Given its size and density, this is a medium portion of bread. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the bread (pain) to be approximately 60 grams."

The image shows a small metal bowl containing tiramisu aux fruits rouges with visible mixed red and black berries embedded in a creamy, layered mousse or mascarpone mixture. Step 1: Visual Identification - The portion is a single serving scoop, visibly mixing creamy layers with fruit berries including raspberries and blueberries. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The bowl is relatively small, approximately the size of a small dessert bowl (~10 cm diameter), and the portion occupies about half the bowl volume, estimating roughly 150 ml volume. The depth and density are typical of a tiramisu dessert: creamy but dense due to mascarpone and soaked biscuit layers. Step 3: Density Considerations - Tiramisu is fairly dense (mascarpone cheese, whipped cream, soaked biscuits), combined with the slight volume of dense berries. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given Swiss portion sizes and visible amount, this is a medium portion of tiramisu dessert likely prepared individually. Known typical tiramisu individual portions range around 120-150 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - The berries and creamy layers appear well mixed and dense, so the weight likely corresponds closely to volume in ml due to water and fat content. Considering the total mix and comparison with known dessert standards, an estimate near 140 grams is reasonable."

The image shows a blue rectangular lid with several dollops of homemade hummus. The hummus is spread unevenly, with some peaks and valleys, indicating some depth. The container lid size, based on the visible thumb for scale, appears to be roughly 12 cm in length and 6 cm in width. The hummus covers most of the lid with a thickness averaging about 1.5 to 2 cm, accounting for the uneven surface. Homemade hummus is dense due to the chickpea and tahini base. Given these dimensions, the volume can be approximated around 12 cm x 6 cm x 1.7 cm = about 122 cubic centimeters. The density of hummus is roughly 1 g/cm3, so the weight is close to the volume in grams. Considering some air pockets in the uneven surface and possible slight inaccuracies, the weight should be slightly lower than the volume estimate. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for this portion size of homemade hummus is approximately 110 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing a creamy porridge with visible chia seeds mixed in. The bowl appears to be a small to medium-sized typical breakfast bowl (approximately 10-12 cm in diameter). The porridge fills the bowl to about 2/3 of its height, which I estimate to be around 5-6 cm deep. Considering the density of porridge with soaked oats and chia seeds, which is moderately dense but not too compact, a typical Swiss breakfast portion size would be smaller than US portions. Based on visual volume and density, the porridge likely weighs between 180-240 grams for a medium portion. I estimate this specific portion to be around 210 grams, reflecting a medium-sized serving consistent with Swiss portion norms and the visible amount in the bowl."

The image shows a single whole apple (pomme) placed on a granite countertop. By comparing the apple to the typical granite surface patterns and average apple sizes, the fruit appears to be of medium size, approximately 7-8 cm in diameter. The apple is round and looks solid with typical density for apples. Considering Swiss portion sizes for a medium apple, the weight range is usually between 150 to 200 grams. Since this apple looks neither particularly small nor large and has an intact skin adding to total weight, a conservative estimate would be around the middle of this range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the pomme to be approximately 175 grams."

The image shows a white bowl with a mixture that includes blanc battu, chia seeds, honey, and flocons d'avoine (oat flakes). The flocons d'avoine are mixed in the creamy base and are visible as thin, flattened flakes dispersed throughout. Considering visual depth and texture, the oat flakes occupy a submerged volume within the mixture. Comparing the bowl size to typical medium kitchen bowls (about 12-14 cm diameter), and estimating the portion, the flocons d'avoine appear to be a modest quantity typical of a breakfast serving. Oat flakes are dense when wet and absorb moisture but retain their weight. Given the visible concentration and spread, I estimate the portion of flocons d'avoine in this mixture to be about 30 to 40 grams. Taking a medium estimate, I assign 35 grams to the flocons d'avoine in this bowl."

The target food item is 'graines de chia' (chia seeds), which are visible as small black and grey specks mixed throughout the white base of 'blanc battu' with some visible oat flakes and honey. Visually, the chia seeds are scattered and mixed, not in a separate pile, making it challenging to isolate them by volume. The bowl is a medium size and contains a creamy mixture, mostly white with oats and chia seeds. The chia seeds typically have high density but small individual size, and usually are consumed in small amounts as a supplement. Considering the extent of visible chia seeds dispersed evenly in the mixture's volume and typical Swiss portion sizes that tend to be moderate, it is reasonable to estimate about 10-15 grams of chia seeds. Given the moderate coverage and mixing, a middle-range estimation of 12 grams is appropriate."

The image shows a white bowl containing a creamy white mixture with visible small black chia seeds and some oat flakes. The food item to estimate is 'blanc battu,' which is a type of cultured milk similar to yogurt but thicker and creamier. We see that the bowl is about a medium size, with the contents filling roughly half to two-thirds of the bowl. Given the creamy texture and the presence of mix-ins (oats and chia seeds), the mixture's density is moderate, slightly thicker than yogurt. Typical portion sizes of blanc battu used as a snack or breakfast in Switzerland are around 120 to 180 grams per serving. Assuming some of the volume is from oats and chia seeds, and the blanc battu is the base and majority volume, the blanc battu alone would be slightly less than the total content volume. Estimating the total mixture here visually at around 160 grams and subtracting some weight for oats and chia (about 40 grams), the blanc battu portion is likely about 120 grams. This aligns well with typical Swiss portions and the visual fill level in the bowl."

The target food item is 'miel' (honey), which is visible as thin drizzles on the surface of the mixture in the bowl. The bowl itself is medium-sized and the honey is not layered thickly but rather appears as light streaks scattered around the surface. Honey is dense and heavy, but given the small visible quantity and that it is mixed with the white base and other ingredients, the total volume of honey is quite low. Visually, it looks like about 1 teaspoon (about 5 ml) of honey is present, which corresponds roughly to 7 grams as honey has a density near 1.4 g/ml. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the honey to be approximately 7 grams."

The image shows a white plate with a portion of salade grecque, consisting mainly of chopped cucumbers, red and yellow bell peppers, black olives (cut in halves), small pieces of white feta cheese, and some thin slices of onion. The salad is spread out thinly on the plate and takes up a moderate surface area, roughly a third of the plate's inner space. The pieces are small cubes and slices, and the depth of the salad is low since it is not piled up. The olives are dense, as is the feta cheese, while the vegetables are lighter but fresh and firm, also adding bulk. Considering the visual quantity and typical densities of such ingredients combined, the total weight of the salade grecque in this portion is likely small to medium-sized, roughly between 90 and 130 grams. Given the moderate amount and visual volume, I estimate the weight at about 110 grams."

The target food is 'sauce salade moutarde'. The image shows a white plate with a Greek salad composed of cucumbers, olives, red and yellow bell peppers, onions, and small chunks of feta cheese. There is no visible pool or amount of dressing separate from the salad ingredients; the dressing appears lightly mixed throughout. Mustard salad dressings are typically oil and vinegar based with a slightly viscous texture but generally applied in small quantities to avoid overpowering the salad. Given the salad's appearance, the sauce layer is very thin and absorbed into the vegetables. Estimating visually, the total volume of the mustard salad dressing is small, approximately 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml). The density of mustard-based salad dressing is close to that of water but slightly higher due to oil and mustard. This results in about 15 to 30 grams of dressing. Considering the conservative Swiss portion size and that the dressing lightly coats but does not saturate the salad, a medium portion close to 20 grams is a reasonable estimate for the sauce salade moutarde on this plate."

The target food item is 'haricots coco,' which are visible in the upper left part of the plate. They appear as chopped flat green bean pieces, likely cooked, and arranged in a small pile. I counted approximately 15 pieces of cut haricots coco. Each piece looks roughly 3-5 cm long and about 1-2 cm wide, with a thickness typical of cooked flat beans, around 0.5-1 cm. Considering their cooked state, they retain some moisture but are still relatively light. Comparing their size to the plate (standard small Swiss dinner plate about 22 cm diameter) and the curry rice portion, the beans occupy about one quarter of the plate's visible area and have moderate thickness, giving a volume estimation of about 120-150 ml. Given the density of cooked green beans (around 0.6-0.7 g/ml), the total weight is likely between 75 and 105 grams. Considering this portion is moderate in size and not heaped, I estimate the total weight of the haricots coco at approximately 90 grams."

The target food item is 'riz et lentilles au curry,' which is the yellowish mixed portion on the bottom right of the plate. Visually, the portion is spread flat but has some slight height and density as it is a cooked mixture of rice and lentils with curry. Comparing to the plate which is a standard medium-sized plate (about 25 cm diameter), the portion occupies roughly a quarter of the plate. The volume and thickness appear moderate, around 1.5 to 2 cm thick on average. Cooked rice and lentils are dense foods, so this portion likely weighs more than it appears. Typical cooked rice or lentil servings of this visible size usually range from 150 to 220 grams. Given the volume and density visible, I estimate it closer to a medium portion in that range, around 180 grams, considering the curry mixtures add some moisture but not much volume. Therefore, I estimate the weight of 'riz et lentilles au curry' to be approximately 180 grams."

The target food is 'poulet au curry', which is located in the right compartment of the black container. Visually, there are about 5 to 6 pieces of chicken coated in a thick curry sauce. The pieces vary in size, with some larger chunks around 5-6 cm in length and others smaller, possibly closer to 3-4 cm. The depth of the curry sauce suggests some chicken pieces may be partially submerged, indicating more volume than a flat surface suggests. Considering chicken's density (dense meat), and that the sauce adds weight but does not count as a separate food item, we focus only on the chicken pieces. Given Swiss portion sizes are generally smaller than US portions, this looks like a medium portion. A single medium chicken breast piece with sauce can weigh around 40-50 grams. Multiplying by the approximate visible pieces (5), this suggests a range of 200-250 grams total. Factoring a slight reduction for sauce volume and possible partial hiding, I estimate the weight of the chicken pieces themselves to be about 220 grams."

The image shows a black plastic container divided into two compartments. The left compartment contains frozen-style French fries (frites), while the right contains poulet au curry. Focusing on the frites, they are uniform, uncooked, and piled loosely without compacting. Counting the fries roughly yields around 50 to 60 pieces. Each frozen French fry typically weighs about 5-7 grams given their size and density. Lengthwise, each fry appears around 7-9 cm, standard for typical frozen fries seen in Swiss portions. Considering the amount, the total volume looks like a medium portion for Swiss standards. Accounting for the loose pile and the uncooked state, I estimate a weight range of 200-250 grams for the fries. Since the portion is moderate and not overly packed, a middle value around 230 grams is reasonable for the visible amount of frozen fries in the container."

Typical Swiss apple portions are smaller than US sizes, and this apple is relatively compact with a round shape. Considering the apple's density and size, it is unlikely to exceed 150g, but it also doesn't look very small. A reasonable estimation for this apple's weight is between 120g to 140g. Taking a middle-ground estimate for a medium small apple, the weight is approximately 130 grams."

The target food item is 'mélange de légumes' visible on the plate as a cooked vegetable mix primarily consisting of diced zucchini and yellow bell pepper pieces. The portion is roughly a small pile located on the left side of the plate. The vegetables appear cooked, which means some moisture loss but retention of density. The pile is about 6 cm by 5 cm on the plate surface and roughly 2 cm thick given the layering. Given that cooked vegetables have moderate density, I estimate the volume to be roughly 60 cubic centimeters. Assuming vegetable density close to 0.8 g/cm3, this results in about 48 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes are modest and the pile looks small to medium, I place the weight around the middle of the range, close to 50 grams. This estimation excludes any container weight and is based solely on the visible vegetable mix portion on the plate."

The image shows one whole fajitas galette (flatbread) folded in half on a white plate. The galette takes roughly half the plate's diameter, which is a standard small to medium-sized plate (approximately 24 cm diameter). The galette appears thin and slightly flexible, with a texture indicating a whole wheat or similar grain composition. Standard whole wheat fajita tortillas or galettes in Swiss portions typically weigh between 40 to 60 grams each, considering they are thinner and smaller than US tortillas. This galette looks standard size, not thick or unusually dense. Comparing it to the size of the three chicken skewers also supports the estimate. Hence, I estimate the weight of this fajitas galette to be 50 grams, a medium portion size in typical Swiss servings."

The image shows a plate with three Thai-style chicken skewers ('brochette de poulet façon thaï'), a folded whole wheat fajita wrap, and a mixed vegetable side. I will focus on the chicken skewers only. There are three skewers, each approximately the length of a palm finger, about 10-12 cm long and moderately thick. Each skewer seems to hold a single continuous piece of dense cooked chicken breast. Considering the density of cooked chicken breast (approximately 1.1 g/cm3) and the dimensions, each skewer likely weighs around 40-50 grams. With three skewers visible, the combined weight is roughly 120-150 grams. Given this is a Swiss portion and the skewers appear slightly lean and moderate in size, I estimate the total weight of the 'brochette de poulet façon thaï' to be approximately 135 grams."

The target food item is 'haricots vert' (green beans). In the image, the green beans are placed on the left side of a standard-sized plate. I count approximately 25 individual green beans, with an average length around 6-7 cm, typical for cooked green beans. They form a small pile, but not very thick—roughly 1 to 2 beans thick in some spots, so some volume is hidden underneath. Considering green beans are relatively dense for vegetables but still quite light, the total volume is moderate. Visually, this appears to be a small to medium portion in Swiss context, smaller than US portions. Typical cooked green beans weigh about 20-25 grams per handful of this size. Given these observations, I estimate the weight of the haricots vert on the plate to be around 65 grams."

The tortellini are located on the right side of the plate in a visible pile mixed with sauce tomate. I count approximately 15 tortellini pieces. Each tortellini appears medium-sized, typically around 10-15 grams per piece when cooked and sauced. The pasta with sauce appears dense and moist, indicating a somewhat heavier weight than dry pasta alone. Given the portion size on a standard Swiss plate (smaller portion standard), the total weight for these tortellini with sauce should be estimated at the middle range of typical portions. Considering 15 pieces averaging about 12 grams each, the total weight estimate is around 180 grams. This accounts for the sauce weight adhering to the tortellini but excludes container or plate weight."

The target food item is 'sauce tomate', which appears to be mixed and coating the tortellini on the right side of the plate. The sauce itself is not separate but visually integrated with the pasta. To estimate the weight of the sauce tomato alone, I observe the coverage and thickness. The sauce layer is moderate—covering the tortellini pieces but not heavily pooling on the plate. The tortellini portion looks like a medium Swiss portion, roughly 10 pieces with sauce coverage. Typical tomato sauce on pasta at this portion size weighs about 40-60 grams in Switzerland. Given the medium coverage and standard plating, I estimate the sauce tomate to be around 50 grams. This excludes pasta weight and considers only the sauce volume visible coating the pasta."

The target food item is 'pâtes avec sauce à la demi-crème + safran'. Visually, the pasta portion occupies roughly half of the plate, with penne pasta clearly visible coated with a creamy yellow sauce, indicative of the saffron demi-cream sauce. The pasta pieces are well cooked and densely packed, showing some layering and overlap, suggesting a moderate to substantial depth. Comparing the pasta to the brochettes of sausages on the same plate, which appear smaller and denser, the pasta portion looks like a medium serving common in Swiss context, smaller than typical US portions. Estimating volume based on plate size (standard dinner plate of about 25-27cm diameter), the pasta mound is around 10cm by 6cm in surface area and about 2-3cm deep on average. Cooked pasta with sauce generally has a density around 0.9-1.1 g/cm3 due to sauce moisture. Using a conservative approach balanced for sauce density and visual fullness, a medium portion in this size range weighs approximately 140-170 grams. Selecting a midpoint, the estimated weight for the pasta with demi-cream and saffron sauce is about 155 grams."

The target food is 'brochettes de saucisses' which are clearly visible on the right side of the plate. There are three sausage pieces skewered on a wooden stick, each piece about the length of a medium finger segment, approximately 7-8 cm long and about 3 cm in diameter. The sausages appear dense and cooked with visible browning, indicating some moisture loss but still substantial density. A standard small sausage weighs around 50 grams, but these pieces are slightly shorter than full-sized sausages. Assuming each piece weighs about 40 grams, the total weight for the three pieces together is roughly 120 grams. The weight does not include the skewer, and no other sausage portions are present or hidden. Given the Swiss portion context, the size is a medium portion, so the estimation is conservative and well-grounded visually."
2ahgvr,sandwich au fromage,224.0,165.0,59.0,59.0,0.32590254488064707,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/02d38718-0a21-4e6e-bffd-41eac4914809,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single sandwich au fromage made with a seeded baguette-style bread roll, approximately 20-22 cm in length, typical of smaller Swiss portions. The bread is dense with a thick crust and a soft interior. The sandwich contains about 4-5 slices of semi-hard cheese, visible with some overlapping, each roughly 1-2 mm thick, plus a few leaves of lettuce. The cheese is denser than bread and leafy greens, so the cheese slices alone likely weigh around 40-50 grams in total. The baguette, considering its size and density, is estimated to weigh between 120-140 grams. Lettuce adds negligible weight, about 5 grams. Summing these estimates and considering the portion as medium-sized, the total weight of the sandwich au fromage (focusing only on the cheese inside) is about 45 grams of cheese. Since the prompt asks specifically for the weight of 'sandwich au fromage' as a whole food item, standard practice is to include the whole sandwich without container but taking everything inside (bread and filling). Therefore, combined the sandwich weighs approximately 165 grams. This reflects a typical medium-sized Swiss cheese sandwich with seeded bread. The main visual cue is the substantial bread size and visible cheese quantity."

The image shows three pieces of bread on a small white plate. Two pieces have a pale yellow spread identified as honey ('miel'), and the third piece has a red spread (likely raspberry jam). The honey appears lightly spread, covering about half the surface area of two pieces of bread. Each bread piece looks like a small roll, roughly 7 cm in diameter, with a moderate thickness. A typical slice of such bread weighs around 30-35g. Honey is dense and sticky, so even a small layer adds some weight. Considering the visible area covered and average spread thickness (~2-3 mm), the honey volume approximates to about 5 grams per piece. Since two pieces are visible with honey, total honey weight is about 10 grams. There is no honey visible on the third piece. Following Swiss portion sizes, this is a reasonable, medium honey amount on bread. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of honey ('miel') to be approximately 10 grams."

The image shows three pieces of bread ('pain') on a small white plate placed on a wooden surface. The slices appear to be from a small baguette or similar white bread, with a light, airy crumb and a moderately thick crust. Each piece looks to be about 7-8 cm in length, 5-6 cm in width, and about 2-3 cm thick. Given the density of typical French bread which is lighter and airier than whole grain bread, each piece would weigh approximately 20-25 grams. There are three pieces total, so the cumulative weight should be around 60-75 grams. Considering Swiss portions are smaller than US portions and the pieces are not very thick, I estimate the total bread weight to be about 68 grams."

The image shows three pieces of bread with different spreads on them placed on a small plate. Two of the bread pieces have a yellow spread, identified as beurre (butter). The butter is spread thinly but covers a good surface area on both pieces. Given the small size of each bread piece (about the size of a small bread roll slice), the butter coverage looks moderate, not thick. Considering typical portion sizes and the density of butter, each piece likely has about 5-6 grams of butter. Since two pieces have butter, combined weight of butter is around 10-12 grams total, but the question asks for estimation of the butter weight, assuming all butter combined on the bread. Therefore, I estimate the total butter weight to be approximately 11 grams."

The image shows three pieces of bread with spreads on a small plate. The target food is ""confiture framboise"" (raspberry jam), which is visible on two pieces of bread in the upper half of the image. The jam is spread in a thin layer, with some areas thicker than others but generally moderate coverage. Each piece of bread seems to be a small baguette slice approximately 6-7 cm in diameter, typical for Swiss portions. Raspberry jam is a dense sugary spread with a density slightly higher than water, but the applied volume here is moderate to low. Considering the visible surface area and estimated thickness (about 2-3 mm on average), and typical jam density (~1.3 g/cm³), the total jam weight on the two bread pieces looks to be about 15-20 grams. Given the spread coverage is uneven and not very thick, I estimate a total weight of 18 grams for the ""confiture framboise."""

The image shows a glass jar containing a mixture of pasta, tomato sauce with tuna, peppers (poivrons), and grated parmesan. The target food item is 'poivrons', visible as red and yellow pieces distributed throughout the jar. Visually, the jar is small and filled just over halfway, and the peppers are diced small but visible in several pieces dispersed throughout the content. Considering the jar size (comparable to a small jam jar of about 200-250 ml volume) and the fact that peppers are mixed but not the dominant ingredient, the peppers likely weigh less than the pasta or sauce. Red and yellow bell peppers cooked slightly hold density close to fresh peppers, which have a density of about 0.9 g/cm³. The pieces visible suggest roughly 30-40 grams of peppers, factoring depth and volume distribution inside the jar. I estimate the poivrons weight between 30 and 40 grams, leaning toward a medium portion due to the visible quantity and typical Swiss serving size. Therefore, I estimate the weight of 'poivrons' at 35 grams."

The target food is 'pâtes' (pasta) visible inside a small glass jar. Step 1: Identifying the pasta inside the jar alongside sauce, peppers, and grated parmesan. The pasta is spaghetti shaped and occupies roughly half to two-thirds of the jar's volume. Step 2: The jar is small, likely holding about 250 ml total volume. The pasta appears packed with some sauce and vegetables, making the volume occupied by pasta slightly less than the jar's volume. Step 3: Considering pasta density: cooked pasta is dense and compact, so volume corresponds fairly closely to weight. A typical cooked pasta density is roughly 150 g per cup (240 ml) solid weight. Since the pasta fills about 130-150 ml of the jar portion, the pasta weight should be around 80-90 grams. Step 4: Portion size: this looks like a small to medium portion given Swiss smaller serving sizes, so I choose the middle of the range. Step 5: Cross-validation: the presence of sauce and vegetables reduces pure pasta volume somewhat, but the pasta strands appear tightly coiled, compensating for that. Therefore, I estimate the 'pâtes' weight as approximately 85 grams."

The target food item is 'sauce tomate au thon' visible inside the jar mixed with other ingredients like pasta, poivrons, and parmesan. Visually, the sauce appears to coat the pasta and is distributed throughout the jar, but the sauce itself is not bulky and occupies the spaces between noodles and vegetables. The jar is medium-sized, about the volume of a standard 250 ml jar. The sauce looks dense due to presence of tuna and tomato, which adds to weight but is also mixed with some liquid. Considering the volume it occupies (slightly less than half the jar when taking into account pasta and other solids), and the density of tomato sauce with tuna (approximately 0.9 to 1 g/ml), the sauce volume is roughly 80-100 ml. This translates to about 80 to 100 grams of sauce. Given a medium portion, I will estimate this at approximately 90 grams."

The target food item is 'parmesan râpé' visible inside a jar with pasta, tomato sauce with tuna, and bell peppers. Visually, parmesan is finely grated and is sprinkled throughout the visible top and some pockets among the pasta strands. The jar appears to be a small glass jar roughly 10 cm tall, commonly used for single servings. The parmesan layer is thin but visible on top and interspersed inside, likely around 5-7 grams given the light, fluffy nature of grated cheese. Considering Swiss portion sizes are smaller than US and the parmesan is a garnish rather than a main volume food, a medium portion estimate is about 6 grams. This accounts for the visible amount and probable hidden shreds mixed in but excludes the container weight. Therefore, the estimated weight of the grated parmesan is 6 grams."

The image shows a single baby banana ('baby banane') placed on a wooden surface. Baby bananas are smaller and shorter than standard bananas, typically around 10-12 cm in length. The visible banana appears to be of average thickness for this variety. Comparing it with the wooden floor elements for scale, the banana seems to be fully intact and not cut or missing parts. Baby bananas generally weigh between 80 and 110 grams each due to their dense, compact flesh. Given the size and common density of this fruit, and considering Swiss portion norms tend to be conservative but consistent with average baby banana weights, I estimate the weight of the 'baby banane' shown to be approximately 95 grams."

The image shows three petits pains au chocolat laid out on a granite or similar countertop surface. Each petit pain au chocolat is a small, round pastry with visible chocolate pieces on top. Step 1: I see exactly three individual petits pains au chocolat, so the total weight will be the sum of three pieces. Step 2: Dimension-wise, each petit pain au chocolat appears about 6-7 cm in diameter and has a typical thickness of about 3-4 cm based on the puffiness of the dough and chocolate. The granite surface gives a rough scale reference indicating standard size for small French pastries. Step 3: These are dense pastries with chocolate filling, so they are relatively heavy compared to simple bread rolls. Typically, a Swiss-sized petit pain au chocolat weighs less than larger bakery standards, but still roughly 50-60 grams each. Step 4: Given these are slightly rounded and compact three pastries without any extra size indications, I estimate each at about 55 grams. For three units, this totals approximately 165 grams. Step 5: No container weight included, and pastries are not visibly altered so standard density applies. Therefore, the estimated total weight for the three petits pains au chocolat shown is about 165 grams."

The image shows three slices of whole wheat bread ('pain complet') on a small plate. Each slice appears medium thickness typical of Swiss portions, approximately 1.5 cm thick, with a rough texture indicating dense whole grain. The slices are slightly larger than the plate's diameter visible behind them, suggesting dimensions around 10 cm by 12 cm. Typical whole wheat bread density is moderate, and a slice of this size generally weighs between 40 to 50 grams. Given the three slices visible, but the target is only 'pain complet' as a single item, it is likely that the request is for the total bread weight on the plate. I will assume all three slices together represent the portion. Therefore, multiplying an estimated 45 grams per slice by three slices gives a weight of approximately 135 grams. There is no visible butter included in the weight, so it's excluded as per instructions. This estimation is consistent with typical Swiss bread portion sizes and the visual volume presented."

The image shows three slices of pain complet (whole grain bread) each spread moderately with butter (beurre). The target food is ""beurre"". Starting with visual identification, butter is present as spread patches on the surface of each bread slice. There are three slices, each with multiple uneven patches of butter. For dimension analysis, the total butter coverage on each slice corresponds roughly to about 1 teaspoon per slice, recognizing the spread thickness is thin but uneven, with some spots thicker. A teaspoon of butter weighs about 5 grams. Therefore, for three slices, the total butter quantity is about 3 teaspoons, or approximately 15 grams. Considering butter's density (dense, solid fat), the visual spread matches this volume. There is no indication of butter underneath or hidden layers. Using Swiss portion context (smaller portions), 15 grams is reasonable and not an overestimation. Thus, the best estimate based purely on visual evidence and logical deduction is 15 grams of butter."

The image shows a small white plastic container viewed from above, filled nearly to the brim with a creamy mixture identified as 'yogourt muesli.' The yogurt with muesli appears thick with visible small bits indicating the muesli mixed inside. The container resembles a standard single-serving yogurt cup common in Switzerland, which usually contains about 125 grams in total. Considering this is a typical retail portion size, with dense yogurt and the added weight of muesli, and the container is nearly full without visible spillage or emptiness, the most accurate estimate is close to the standard portion weight of around 125 grams. Therefore, the estimated weight of the yogourt muesli, based solely on visual evidence and Swiss portion context, is approximately 125 grams."

The vinaigre balsamique is a liquid dressing that is likely applied as a light drizzle on the salad. Visually, there is a slight shine and some small pools of balsamic vinegar visible particularly on the tomato slices and the surrounding salad leaves. Given the typical portion of vinaigre balsamique used as a dressing on a plate of this size, it is reasonable to estimate approximately 1-2 tablespoons. Each tablespoon of vinegar weighs about 15 grams. Considering the light application here, it is likely closer to 1 tablespoon or slightly less. Therefore, I estimate the vinaigre balsamique weighs about 12 grams in this portion."

The target food item is 'salade verte'. In the image, it is located on the left side of the plate, beneath the visible tomato slices and sprinkled seeds. The salad is made up of leafy greens that are loosely piled with some volume but light density. The portion appears to cover roughly a quarter of the 20 cm diameter plate, considering the leaves' natural fluffiness and light layering. Given the typical density of mixed leafy greens and Swiss portion context, the depth of the leaves is moderate but not compacted, corresponding to about 40-50 grams per medium portion. The salad does not appear overly abundant or sparse, placing it around a medium size portion. Therefore, estimating conservatively but precisely, the weight of the salade verte is approximately 45 grams."

The target food item is ""tomate"" (tomato). In the image, the tomatoes are visible as sliced pieces arranged clearly on the plate alongside salad greens, pasta, and dried pork meat. There are approximately 5 medium slices of tomato, each about 1 cm thick and roughly 5 cm long. Considering typical fresh tomato density and size, each slice likely weighs between 15 and 18 grams. The total tomato portion is around 75 to 90 grams. Given the standard size of a Swiss portion and visual comparison with the other items on the plate (salad leaves and meat), I estimate the total tomato weight to be about 80 grams, a medium portion accordant with the overall plate size."

The image shows a plate divided into four main components: green salad with seeds, sliced tomato, cooked vegetable pasta, and thin slices of dried pork meat. The target food is 'mélange de graines' (seed mix), which is visibly sprinkled mostly over the tomato slices and some over the salad leaves. The seeds appear to be a mix of pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds. Visually estimating the seed quantity, it covers roughly a small surface area, with an approximate layer of seeds no more than 2-3 mm thick. The seeds are spread thin and not piled. Comparing their size to the tomato slices and knife nearby provides scale; the pumpkin and sunflower seeds are each around 1-2 cm long. The amount looks like around one tablespoon, which typically weighs between 10 and 15 grams depending on the seed types. Given this is a moderate sprinkle rather than a heaped spoon, I estimate the seed mixture weight closer to 12 grams, accounting for density and size of seeds in a Swiss portion context."

The image shows a plate with multiple food items including salade verte, tomate, mélange de graines, pâtes aux légumes, and viande séchée des grissons (pork dried meat) located in the bottom right section of the plate. Visually, the dried meat is presented as about three thin, folded slices, roughly covering a small quarter of the plate. Each slice is thin and delicate, typical of dried pork meat, which is dense but light due to its thin nature. Compared to the plate size and knife handle visible for scale, the total volume appears small. Dried pork meat of this size often weighs around 15-20 grams per slice in such portions, but here slices are thin and slightly smaller. Estimating carefully, each slice weighs about 12 grams on average, multiplied by three slices gives roughly 36 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes are generally smaller than US, I lean towards a slightly conservative estimate. Accounting for density and thinness of the slices, I estimate the total weight of the viande séchée des grissons to be approximately 35 grams."

The target food item is 'pâtes aux légumes (aubergines et carottes)', which appears on the right side of the plate. Visually, the pasta mixed with vegetables occupies about a third of the plate. The pasta is cut into short pieces and mixed with visible small chunks of vegetables. The plate is of standard Swiss small dinner size (about 20 cm diameter). Comparing the pasta portion to the other items on the plate (tomato slices and slices of dry- cured meat), the volume of the pasta mixed with vegetables seems consistent with a medium portion. Considering the depth of the food piled roughly 2-3 cm, the pasta and vegetable mixture is dense and cooked. Dense cooked pasta with vegetables typically weighs more than expected due to water content and vegetable density. A medium Swiss portion of pasta with vegetables would range between 130 to 170 grams. Given the visible amount, I estimate the weight of the 'pâtes aux légumes (aubergines et carottes)' to be about 150 grams."

The image shows a single red apple ('pomme') placed next to a croissant on a wooden table, which provides a scale reference. The apple appears to be a small to medium-sized variety common in Swiss contexts, roughly about the size of a fist but slightly smaller than a large apple. Considering typical Swiss apple portions are smaller than American, this apple likely weighs less than a large apple. Apples are dense fruits with skin included in the weight. Given the visual size and comparison to the croissant, I estimate the apple weighs approximately 140 to 160 grams. Choosing the middle value to reflect a typical medium-small apple portion in Switzerland, the estimated weight is around 150 grams."

The croissant appears to be of medium size, with a typical Swiss portion likely smaller than standard US sizes. The apple provides a good reference: a small-to-medium apple weighs about 150-180 grams, and visually the croissant is slightly larger in volume but less dense than the apple. Considering the typical density and flakiness of croissants, which are light and airy despite their volume, and given that Swiss croissants tend to be slightly smaller and less heavy, an estimated range would be about 50-70 grams. Given the visible thickness, layering, and typical Swiss bakery sizes for croissants, I place the weight towards the middle of this range. Therefore, I estimate the croissant de sils to weigh approximately 60 grams."

The image shows a small amount of salade de pâtes remaining on a white plate. The salad consists primarily of penne pasta pieces, some corn kernels, and small bits of tomato and herbs. For Step 1, the pasta pieces can be counted roughly, about 10-12 pieces visible, plus some scattered vegetables. Step 2, using the plate as a size reference, the pasta pieces are typical penne size, about 4 cm long each, and appear to be cooked, thus denser and heavier than dry pasta. The total volume of the pile is quite small, roughly equivalent to a few tablespoons or about a quarter cup. Step 3, considering density, cooked pasta is dense and compact, meaning weight is significant for its visual size. Corn and tomato add little extra weight but must be considered. Step 4, for portion size calibration, this is a very small leftover portion, much less than a standard side portion of pasta salad which would be around 150-180 g. Given the amount visible, the estimation falls into a small portion range of approximately 50-70 grams. Step 5, cross-validating to avoid underestimation considering the density of cooked pasta, and the visible volume, the safest estimate is in the middle of the small portion range around 60 grams. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the salade de pâtes shown to be approximately 60 grams."
m4egh2,mélange de céréales,58.0,210.0,152.0,51.20987654320987,0.21739988163345828,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/9942fa79-be93-458e-b6a9-22fda9333ff4,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'mélange de céréales' mixed with yogurt and blueberries in a bowl. Visually, the bowl is medium-sized and contains a thick mixture spread across the base and piled up slightly. The cereal flakes seem typical in size and density, combined with yogurt which adds moisture and some weight. There are visible blueberries scattered throughout, but since the mixture is homogeneous and the request is only for the cereal portion, the entire mix can be considered together as the milk/yogurt soaked cereal. The volume of the mix in the bowl appears substantial, about a medium portion suitable for one person, with an estimated depth around 3-4 cm, width and length roughly 12 cm each. Considering the density of soaked cereal with yogurt is moderate and the presence of dense blueberries adds some weight, an appropriate medium portion weight estimate would range from approximately 180g to 230g. Given the volume and density visible, a fair estimate is around 210 grams for the cereal mixture excluding the container. This considers the Swiss smaller portion context."
m4egh2,myrtilles,96.0,15.0,81.0,51.20987654320987,0.19175379759321365,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/9942fa79-be93-458e-b6a9-22fda9333ff4,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries) visible mixed throughout the cereal and yogurt bowl. Step 1: Visual identification shows approximately 20-25 whole blueberries scattered mixed through the mixture. Step 2: Dimension analysis – each blueberry appears typical in size, about 1.5 to 2 cm in diameter, consistent with standard wild or cultivated blueberries. Step 3: Density – blueberries are light but dense fruits, weighing about 0.5 to 0.7 grams each. Step 4: Portion size calibration – counting 20-25 berries, each about 0.6 grams on average, yields approximately 12 to 15 grams total. Considering some berries may be partially hidden or mashed into the yogurt, a small upward adjustment is reasonable. Step 5: Cross-validation – blueberries in this portion do not appear excessive or sparse. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the myrtilles in the bowl to be close to 15 grams."

The target food item is 'yogourt orange sanguine,' which is visible mixed with the cereal and blueberries in the bowl. First, the bowl is medium-sized and contains a mixed portion of cereal, blueberries, and the yogurt. The yogurt is the creamy base that coats the cereal and berries. Typically, a yogurt portion in such a bowl would be about 150 to 200 grams, considering the visible volume and the fact that the yogurt has soaked into the cereal, adding to its weight and creamy texture. The cereal flakes and berries take some volume and weight, so the yogurt itself is not the entire content but a significant part of it. Given the visual density and typical Swiss portion sizes (which are smaller than U.S. portions), I would estimate the yogurt amount here to be medium-sized, around 170 grams, as it looks neither a full large container nor minimal. Also, the yogurt seems to be well mixed and evenly distributed but not overflowing, consistent with this estimation."

The image shows a single whole nectarine placed directly on a granite countertop, which provides a rough size reference. The nectarine is round and appears typical in size for Swiss portions, which tend to be smaller than US ones. By comparison to the granite surface texture and common dimensions of nectarines, its diameter is approximately 6-7 cm. Considering the density of stone fruits like nectarines, which include their skin and juicy flesh, a nectarine of this size typically weighs between 130 and 160 grams. No pieces are missing or hidden, and there are no layers or mixing involved, so the weight estimation is straightforward. Given a medium-sized nectarine and standard density, I estimate the weight to be about 150 grams."

The image shows a portion of 'pain aux fruits' held between two fingers which provides a scale reference. The piece appears to be roughly 6-7 cm in width and about 1-1.5 cm thick. It's dense bread with visible nuts and possibly dried fruit pieces, which add to weight density. Considering the compact, dense nature of this bread with inclusions and its size roughly half to two-thirds of a standard slice of fruit bread which typically weighs around 70-90 grams per slice, this smaller piece likely weighs less. Estimating the size and thickness carefully and considering the density factors, the weight is approximately 50 grams."
8japfq,focaccia,81.0,130.0,49.0,49.0,0.09787433418820281,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/9b020df4-0b52-470a-a9b2-4d29540bca81,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows three triangular slices of focaccia placed on a white plate. The slices appear thin and crisp, typical of Italian focaccia rather than the thicker variant. Each slice is roughly the size of a quarter of the plate, indicating the original focaccia piece was about a medium-sized portion, approximately 15-18 cm in diameter. Focaccia dough is relatively dense but light due to air bubbles. The thickness is around 0.5 to 1 cm. Considering this and the typical density of baked focaccia, each slice likely weighs between 35 g and 50 g. With three slices visible that do not cover the entire focaccia, but likely the full original piece, combining these gives a weight around 110-140 grams total. Given the visual cues—thinness, slight charring, and size—this portion seems medium-sized, so I select a conservative midpoint estimate of 130 grams for the three slices combined, reflecting the exact visible focaccia without container weight."

The image shows two slices of whole grain bread on a small pink plate, each spread with butter and coing jam. The target food is 'beurre' (butter). The butter is visible as small patches spread thinly on the surface of both slices. The areas covered are uneven but overall thin and not heavily layered. Considering the Swiss portions which tend to be smaller, a typical thin spread of butter on one slice is about 5-7 grams. Here, since the butter is patchy and not fully covering the bread, I estimate approximately 6 grams total butter across both slices. Butter is dense and heavy for its size, so even the small visible portions correspond to this weight. Therefore, the estimated weight of the butter is 6 grams."
m4egh2,pain,150.0,90.0,60.0,48.45454545454545,0.22193726573288616,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/0bf16927-b577-42d5-ad43-bd4264584ecc,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two slices of pain (bread) on a small plate. Each slice is rustic, somewhat thick, and has a dense crumb structure typical of whole grain or nut bread. Both slices are spread with some butter and confiture de coing, but I will only estimate the weight of the bread. Taking the size of the plate as a reference (around 20 cm in diameter) and the thickness of the bread slices (roughly 2-3 cm thick), each slice appears to be a substantial piece of bread. Dense breads like this typically weigh about 40-50 grams per slice of this thickness and size. Since there are two slices, total bread weight is around 80-100 grams. Given the overall volume and density, the estimate is closer to the middle upper bound, about 90 grams."

The target food item is 'confiture de coing' (quince jam) spread on two slices of bread. Visually, the jam is translucent and has a gel-like consistency, spread unevenly but not too thickly, on roughly half of each bread slice's surface. Each slice is around 12 cm long and 6-7 cm wide, with an approximate jam spread thickness of about 3-5 mm in the covered areas. The total jam coverage area roughly equals a full slice of bread at moderate thickness. Considering quince jam is dense and sticky but not extremely heavy per volume, the amount of jam here is moderate—more than a thin spread but less than a thick layering. Given this visual evidence and referencing typical Swiss portion sizes for a breakfast jam serving on bread, the weight of the jam is likely in the range between 20 to 35 grams. Taking a conservative middle estimate, the weight of the confiture de coing here is about 28 grams."
6fwmw2,haticot coco,198.0,120.0,78.0,47.644171779141104,0.38084434799763267,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/6fwmw2/dish_media/1da85bf5-675f-472d-8594-733069301dd5,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'haticot coco,' which refers to the large flat green beans visible on the right side of the bowl. Step 1: I identify approximately 6-7 large flat beans that are notable for their length and width, partially folded but fully occupying about half of the bowl’s surface area. Step 2: By comparing to the bowl size (roughly a medium-sized soup bowl) and the other food items, I estimate each bean to be around 12-15 cm long and about 3-4 cm wide, with a thickness of approximately 0.5-1 cm given their flat but fleshy nature. Step 3: Considering density, green beans are fairly dense cooked vegetables, so their weight is fairly concentrated in a small volume. Step 4: For 6-7 beans with this size, I calculate a total estimated weight range of roughly 100 to 140 grams, treating this as a medium portion. Step 5: Cross-validating with typical Swiss portion sizes for similar cooked green beans, which tend to be smaller portions than US sizes, I select a weight near the middle of this range. Therefore, I conclude the weight of the haticot coco in the bowl is approximately 120 grams."

The image shows a purple bowl containing several ingredients, including green flat beans (haricot coco), yellow-orange small shrimp (crevettes), cooked wheat pearls, and sauce. The shrimp are visible in five pieces, clearly identifiable, each approximately 3-4 cm in length. Comparing their size to the beans and bowl, each shrimp is medium-sized. Considering cooked shrimp density and typical weight, an average cooked shrimp weighs around 8-10 grams. With five shrimp visible, the total weight is roughly 40-50 grams. Given Swiss portion norms and the presence of a few shrimp only, a conservative estimate is about 45 grams total for all the shrimp present."

The target food item is 'perle de blé' which are the small round wheat pearls visible in the purple bowl. Step 1: Visual Identification - The perle de blé is mixed with the sauce and shrimp and occupies roughly half of the bowl by volume under the green beans (haricot coco). Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The bowl appears to be a small-medium sized bowl, approximate diameter about 15 cm. The perle de blé portion looks to fill roughly around 120 ml in volume when considering depth and surface visible, taking account that some is hidden beneath the haricot coco and sauce. Step 3: Density Considerations - Perle de blé are cooked, dense grain-like food with an average density close to 1 g/ml. Given this, the weight approximates volume in grams. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The estimated volume of around 120 ml translates to roughly 120 grams of cooked perle de blé. Given the Swiss portion context and photographic evidence, this would be considered a medium portion. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The quantity aligns visually with common single portion servings of such grains and no signs suggest under or overfilling. Therefore, the estimated weight of the perle de blé is around 120 grams."

The target food item is 'sauce crème 15% au safran,' which visually appears as the yellowish creamy coating on the shrimp and the perle de blé (wheat pearls). The sauce is mixed in with these components rather than served separately. To estimate its weight, I first note the volume of the sauce coating: it covers the shrimp and some of the perle de blé but does not form a thick puddle. The total amount of sauce looks to be moderate, judging by the amount enveloping the other ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. Considering Swiss portion sizes and typical cream-based sauces, a small to medium amount like this usually weighs between 30 to 50 grams. Given the visible coverage and consistency (not overly thick but present), I estimate the sauce crème 15% au safran weighs approximately 40 grams."

The image shows a single pancake placed on a medium-sized plate with colorful patterns. The pancake is round and appears to be about 12-13 cm in diameter judging by the plate size. Its thickness appears uniform and moderately thick, roughly around 1 cm when considering typical pancake thickness. The pancake is not layered nor folded. There is a visible small amount of syrup on top, but the weight estimation is strictly for the pancake itself, excluding syrup and plate. French/Swiss pancake portions are generally smaller than US portions. Given its size and average density (cooked pancake batter is moderately dense but not heavy), a pancake of this diameter and thickness typically weighs between 70 and 90 grams. Considering the visual firmness and typical portion sizes, I estimate this pancake weighs about 80 grams."

The image shows a hand holding five petit beurre biscuits topped with a slab of dark chocolate. For the target food 'petit beurre au chocolat noir', the entire biscuit plus the chocolate topping should be estimated. These biscuits are typical petit beurre size, about 5 cm by 4 cm, with a thickness approximately 0.5 cm for the biscuit base plus around 0.3 cm of the chocolate layer, making total thickness close to 0.8 cm. The density is moderately high due to the biscuit and chocolate combination. Similar products of this type generally weigh between 15 to 18 grams each. Since the biscuits appear to be standard size and fully intact, and no broken pieces are visible, I estimate each petit beurre au chocolat noir weighs about 17 grams. The request is for the weight of one biscuit, so the estimation is 17 grams."

The target food item is 'banane'. In the image, the banana is whole and placed directly on the countertop next to a bowl containing yogurt and blueberries. The banana appears typical in size for a Swiss context, smaller than large US bananas. It is about 18 cm in length, with a normal diameter and no visible cuts or missing pieces. Given this typical size, Swiss medium bananas generally weigh between 110 and 130 grams. Considering the banana's visual fullness and absence of bruising or shriveling, I estimate it to be a medium size banana. Therefore, the most reasonable weight estimate for this banana is around 120 grams."

The target food is 'myrtilles' (blueberries) visible in the bowl on top of plain yogurt. By counting, there are approximately 30 blueberries in the bowl. Each blueberry typically weighs around 1 to 1.5 grams depending on size; these appear average-sized. The blueberries cover an area on top of the yogurt but are in a single visible layer, with no significant hidden depth or piling. Considering Swiss portion sizes which tend to be moderate, and assuming these are fresh, dense blueberries, an average of 1.2 grams per blueberry is reasonable. Multiplying 30 berries by 1.2 grams gives about 36 grams. Accounting for slight variation and some smaller berries, I estimate the weight of the blueberries to be approximately 35 grams."

The target food item is 'yaourt nature' (natural yogurt) which is in the metal bowl visible in the image. Step 1: visual identification shows the yogurt occupies roughly half to two-thirds of the bowl volume, with blueberries on top partially submerged in the yogurt. Step 2: dimension analysis reveals the bowl is medium-sized (approx. 12 cm diameter), and the yogurt depth is modest—about 2 to 3 cm deep given the small bowl curvature. Step 3: density considerations note that plain yogurt is dense but fluid; typical yogurt density is about 1.03 g/mL, almost 1 g/cm3. Step 4: portion calibration - the visible yogurt is a moderate serving, probably between 100 to 150 grams given the bowl size and depth. Step 5: cross-validation with blueberries on top (about 25-30 grams, not included in this estimation) supports the volume assessment. Overall, considering the relatively smaller Swiss portion context and the visible volume, I estimate the weight of the 'yaourt nature' to be approximately 130 grams."

The image shows a white plate containing both strawberries (fraises) and blueberries (myrtilles). The target food item is the strawberries. There are 7 strawberries visible on the plate. Each strawberry is medium-sized, consistent with Swiss portion sizes, roughly around 25-30 grams each considering their size relative to the plate and blueberries. Strawberry density is high due to water content but they are not very heavy per volume. Multiplying the estimated average weight per strawberry (27 grams) by 7 gives approximately 189 grams total. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the strawberries to be around 189 grams."

The apple appears to be of average size for a Swiss portion, roughly around 7 to 8 cm in diameter when compared to the texture of the countertop and typical countertop tile sizes visible in the background. The apple is whole, with skin and stem intact, so the weight includes the skin. Apples are dense fruit with significant water content, so their weight is fairly high relative to size. For an apple of this visible size, the typical weight ranges from 150 to 180 grams. Considering this appears to be a medium-sized apple, I estimate the weight to be approximately 165 grams."

Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The apple halves appear to be medium-sized, approximately 7-8 cm in diameter each, with a typical thickness for apple halves of about 2-3 cm. The plate is standard size, helping gauge size accurately. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cooked apples shrink slightly but retain most of their density. They are mostly water, making them moderately dense but lighter than raw apples by weight. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - A medium raw apple generally weighs around 150-180 grams. Considering cooking shrinkage, the weight is slightly reduced but both halves together still represent approximately 130-150 grams total. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Given the visual volume and standard portion sizes in a Swiss context, and the lack of visible peel and core in the halves, estimating 140 grams total is reasonable and conservative. Therefore, the combined weight of these two halves of cooked apple (pommes) is approximately 140 grams."

Considering density, mozzarella is dense and moist, so weight estimates must account for its compactness. The mozzarella pieces are mixed with other ingredients, but I see no indication that pieces are hidden or layered, so counting visible pieces suffices. Multiplying 12 pieces by an average weight of 5.5 grams gives about 66 grams. To be conservative and allow for some margin of error in piece size, I estimate mozzarella weight as approximately 65 grams."

The target food is 'pesto' within a mixed pasta salad clearly visible inside a plastic container. Visually, pesto appears as a coating and some small green bits spread throughout the ingredients rather than a separate quantity. The container size is roughly a standard meal prep box, approximately 15-20 cm in length. Pesto is generally quite dense and oily, but here it is used as a condiment, not a main ingredient pile. Typical portion sizes of pesto in such pasta salads are small, approximately 1 to 2 tablespoons. Knowing that 1 tablespoon of pesto weighs about 15 grams, and visually estimating this spread and coating amount to be roughly about a tablespoon and a half, the estimated weight of pesto is around 20 to 22 grams. There are no large visible pools of pesto that would imply a larger quantity, so this estimate accounts for the realistic Swiss portion size."
8japfq,tomates cerises,120.0,70.0,50.0,45.784355179704015,0.14795817715525744,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/90f80380-51b1-4945-89c0-35931c2cbfa2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'tomates cerises'. In the image, the cherry tomatoes are visible in roughly 15 to 20 pieces, some whole and some halved, scattered throughout the salad container. Each whole cherry tomato typically weighs around 15 grams, but these appear smaller than the large standard size, more like medium-sized cherry tomatoes closer to 10 grams each. Considering there are about 6 whole tomatoes or the equivalent if counting halves, this gives a base total around 60 grams. The tomatoes are cut and mixed with other ingredients and are partially obscured by pasta and leaves, so some hidden tomatoes likely add to the volume. Accounting conservatively for some hidden tomatoes and cutting reducing weight slightly but included juice remaining, an additional 10-15 grams is added. Therefore, the total weight estimate is in the range of 65 to 75 grams. Considering the Swiss portion context, it's a moderate portion, so I estimate the total weight of the cherry tomatoes as 70 grams."

The image shows a rectangular container filled with a mixed salad of cooked whole wheat pasta, cherry tomatoes, small mozzarella balls, cooked red peppers, pesto, and fresh spinach leaves ('épinards frais'). To estimate only the weight of fresh spinach, I visually isolate the amount of visible spinach leaves scattered throughout the dish. There appear to be moderate-sized spinach leaves, some whole and some torn, distributed within the salad but not densely packed. The container is about the size of a standard lunchbox, roughly 15cm by 10cm and about 4cm deep. The spinach occupies roughly 20% of the visible volume in thin layers. Fresh spinach is light and leafy with a density of about 0.23 g/cm³ when loosely packed. Considering the volume of spinach in the container is roughly equivalent to around 60-80 cm³ (accounting for air gaps), the total fresh spinach weight is approximately between 14 to 18 grams. Given portion size and visual density, the spinach in this portion is therefore estimated at 16 grams."

The image shows a plastic container filled with a salad mixture, including whole wheat pasta ('pâtes complètes'), cherry tomatoes, fresh spinach leaves, small mozzarella balls, and cooked peppers, with pesto dressing. Focusing on the 'pâtes complètes', they are visible as short, spiral-shaped pieces distributed throughout the container. I count approximately 30-40 individual pasta pieces. Each piece appears to be about the size of a small elbow macaroni, roughly 2 cm in length and about 1.5 cm in diameter, suggesting moderate volume. Considering the container is about 15cm x 10cm x 4cm deep, and the pasta occupies roughly 40-50% of the volume interspersed with other vegetables. Cooked whole wheat pasta is dense, with an average cooked density of about 1.2 g/cm3. Given the visual volume and spread, I estimate a medium portion of whole wheat pasta here to be about 120-140 grams. Therefore, I select around 130 grams as a reasoned estimate for the weight of the 'pâtes complètes' in this mixture."

The image shows a rectangular transparent container filled with mixed ingredients. The container holds cooked wholewheat pasta, halved cherry tomatoes, small mozzarella balls, fresh spinach leaves, and visible pieces of cooked red bell peppers (poivrons cuits). The cooked red peppers are cut into small chunks distributed throughout the container. The container is moderately deep, indicating a decent total volume. Visually, the cooked bell peppers represent roughly about 20% of the total mixture volume. Considering cooked bell peppers have a density close to 0.9 g/cm3 and Swiss portion sizes being moderate, I estimate the total weight of cooked bell peppers in this container to be between 55 and 75 grams based on visible amount and portion size norms. Since the portion appears neither very small nor very large, I choose a middle value around 65 grams for the cooked peppers."

The image shows a hand holding a clear glass bottle of Brio Maté, a commercial mate drink. The bottle is a typical long-necked glass bottle, similar in shape and size to standard 330 ml beverage bottles commonly sold in Switzerland. Such bottles usually weigh around 330 grams excluding the container weight. Since the request is to estimate the weight of the food item only, which in this case is the liquid mate inside, we exclude the bottle weight. The liquid volume appears nearly full, about 90% filled. Given the density of mate drinks is close to water at roughly 1 g/ml, the liquid mate weighs approximately the volume in grams. With a 330 ml bottle 90% full, the liquid content weighs about 297 grams. I estimate the weight of the mate liquid in the bottle to be 295 grams, rounding conservatively to Swiss portion standards."

The image shows one single pancake on a medium-sized dessert plate with colorful patterns. The pancake is round and appears to be about 12-14 cm in diameter, which is a typical small to medium size for pancakes in a Swiss context (usually smaller than typical US portions). The thickness looks to be around 1 to 1.5 cm based on the edges slightly visible, and the pancake seems evenly cooked and not overly dense. Pancakes generally have a moderate density due to the batter but are light compared to denser baked goods. Considering the pancake size and typical density, a single pancake of this size would weigh about 70 to 90 grams. Given the pancake looks standard without excessive thickness, I estimate the weight to be approximately 80 grams."

The image shows a medium-sized apple positioned next to a small cup of raspberry sorbet. The apple's diameter is comparable to the width of the cup, which helps gauge its size. A typical medium apple weighs around 150-180 grams. Given the visible size and average density of apples (which are dense fruits with skin), this apple looks slightly above average in size. Taking Swiss portion context into account, I'll estimate it on the moderate-large scale for an apple. Therefore, the estimated weight of the apple is about 170 grams."

The target food item is 'glace sorbet framboise,' which is the raspberry sorbet in the cup on the right side of the image. The sorbet appears to fill a small to medium-sized dessert cup about 7-8 cm in diameter and approximately 4-5 cm deep. The sorbet is piled irregularly, with visible volume indicating a moderate serving that is denser than ice cream due to fruit pulp concentration but lighter than dense cream-based ice cream. Comparing the sorbet cup volume to the apple on the left gives a good scale: the apple weighs approximately 150-170 grams and is larger in overall volume than the sorbet. Considering the depth and compactness of the sorbet, the volume likely corresponds to roughly 100-130 grams of sorbet. Taking into account typical Swiss smaller portion sizes, I estimate the raspberry sorbet portion to be around 120 grams."

The target food item is 'haricots coco,' visible on the left side of the white plate as multiple flat, cut segments of greenish beans. I count approximately 15 pieces of haricots coco, varying slightly in size but generally around 5-7 cm in length and about 2-3 cm wide. The pieces are thick and dense, arranged in a single layer without significant stacking, so depth is roughly 2 cm. Considering the density of cooked haricots coco, which is moderately dense similar to cooked green beans, I estimate about 10-12 grams per piece on average due to thickness and water content. Multiplying 15 pieces by an average of 11 grams yields approximately 165 grams. Given that the portion looks moderate and not piled high, I adjust down slightly for some variation and moisture content than a US portion. Therefore, the final estimated weight of the haricots coco is 150 grams."

The target food is 'riz basmati cuit' (cooked basmati rice) on the plate. Visually, the rice portion occupies roughly one-third of the plate area, appearing as a loose mound. The rice grains are moist and clumped, indicating cooked weight. Comparing to the plate size, standard dinner plates in Switzerland are generally about 24cm in diameter; this plate looks slightly smaller but still similar. The rice pile is approximately 10cm by 7cm in surface area, with a depth of about 2-3cm, judging by the clumped texture. Cooked basmati rice is dense, typically around 130-150 grams per 100 ml of volume. Given the size and depth, this portion corresponds roughly to 150-180 grams. Considering Swiss smaller portions and the visible volume, I estimate the cooked basmati rice weight to be about 160 grams."

The target food is 'dal de lentilles rouges', which is visible as an orange-yellow lentil stew portion on the plate, positioned in the upper right segment of the dish. The dal looks like a dense, wet, mashed mixture with some volume but limited height compared to grains or vegetables. Visually, it covers about one-third of the plate surface in that section and appears to be about 2-3 cm deep considering the mound thickness. The plate is a standard side plate, about 20-22 cm wide, so the dal surface area is roughly 8 cm by 6 cm with approximate depth of 2.5 cm, yielding an estimated volume around 120 cm³. Cooked lentils in this form have a density similar to cooked legumes, approximately 0.85-1.0 g/cm³. Multiplying volume and density gives a range of 100-120 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes (moderate, not overly large servings), this dal portion looks like a medium-sized serving. Thus, I estimate the weight of the 'dal de lentilles rouges' on the plate to be approximately 110 grams."

The image shows a single whole banana placed on a countertop. It is clearly visible and not cut or altered. The banana is of medium size relative to the countertop texture, approximately 15-17 cm in length, which is typical for an average banana in Switzerland. Bananas generally have a dense but not overly heavy composition. A medium banana usually weighs between 100 to 130 grams without peeling. Given the slightly thick appearance and normal size, this banana likely weighs near the middle of that range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the banana to be approximately 120 grams."

The target food item is 'pâtes' (noodles). In the image, the pâtes are cooked and appear as flat, ribbon-like noodles that occupy roughly half of the bowl's surface area. The bowl is medium-sized, approximately 15 cm in diameter, and the depth of the pâtes is about 2-3 cm considering the visible thickness and layering of the noodles. Cooked pasta is dense and compact, so the volume corresponds to a significant weight. Given the visible quantity, and considering this is a Swiss portion, I estimate the range from about 120 to 160 grams, leaning slightly towards a medium portion size due to moderate filling. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the pâtes to be around 140 grams."

The aubergines are visible in the upper left portion of the bowl. They are sliced into thin pieces mixed with a few carrot slices, giving a light volume but moderate density. The bowl diameter, estimated as a typical small container around 15 cm, helps gauge the size of the aubergine pieces. The visible quantity of aubergines amounts to small slices, roughly filling about one quarter of the bowl surface area, with some layering. Given that cooked aubergines retain density similar to cooked vegetables and considering the relatively thin slices, the portion weight is moderate. A typical serving of cooked aubergines of this visible amount in Swiss portions is around 50 to 70 grams. Since the volume is not large or piled very thick, I will select a weight near the lower-middle range around 60 grams."

In the bottom right of the bowl, there is a distinct portion of melted/grated fromage gruyère cheese. The cheese layer appears smooth and somewhat thick, covering an area roughly equivalent to about one quarter of the bowl's visible surface. Given the size of the bowl (standard single-serving container) and visual thickness of the melted cheese, the fromage gruyère portion can be estimated around 30-40 grams. Considering Swiss serving sizes and the dense nature of gruyère cheese, I estimate a medium portion weight close to 35 grams."

The image shows a single piece of gâteau au chocolat placed on a transparent plastic wrap on a wooden surface. The chocolate cake piece is roughly rectangular and appears dense with a porous texture characteristic of a baked chocolate cake. Visually comparing it to the plastic wrap texture and wood grain, the piece seems to measure approximately 6 cm in length, 4 cm in width, and about 3 cm in height. Given the dense nature of chocolate cake, its density is moderate to high, so the volume translates into a relatively substantial weight. Based on typical Swiss portion sizes which are smaller than US servings, and the dimensions observed, I estimate the weight to be around 90 to 110 grams, with a conservative estimate near 100 grams being most appropriate for this piece."

The image shows four slices of 'pain' (bread) on a medium-sized plate with some berries around. Each slice appears to be a small-to-medium slice of whole grain or multigrain bread, roughly 10 cm long and 5-7 cm wide, with a thickness about 1.5 cm. Considering Swiss portion sizes, each slice likely weighs less than standard US thick sandwich bread slices. Typically, a slice of this size and type weighs approximately 30-35 grams. Since there are four slices, but the estimation is only for one slice of 'pain' (as the input indicates the target food is 'pain'), the weight for one slice should be about 30 grams. The slices look lightly buttered and have some jam spread on them, but butter and jam weight are excluded as the target food is only 'pain'.

The target food is 'framboises' (raspberries). In the image, there is a cluster of raspberries on the left side of the plate. I count approximately 10 whole raspberries visible. Each raspberry is about the size of a thumbnail, a typical Swiss raspberry weighing roughly 3-4 grams due to its hollow, light structure. Considering the cluster size and stacking, the total volume corresponds to about 30-40 grams. Given the visible density and that raspberries are light and hollow fruits, I estimate the total weight of the framboises to be approximately 35 grams."

The target food item is 'myrtilles' (blueberries), located on the right side of the plate. There are 15 individual whole blueberries visible, with no obstruction or layering hiding any. Each blueberry is roughly medium size, approximately 1.5-2 cm in diameter. Blueberries, being small dense fruit, typically weigh about 1-1.2 grams each. Taking a conservative average weight of 1.1 grams per blueberry and multiplying by 15 pieces gives a total of about 16.5 grams. Considering the Swiss portion size context and no signs of extra hidden volume, this estimate matches well with visual evidence."

The image shows a plate with four slices of bread ('pain'), each spread with butter ('beurre') and topped with strawberry jam ('confiture fraise'). The target food item is the strawberry jam. Visually, the jam is a thin spread on each slice, covering roughly half to two-thirds of each slice's surface with a slight glistening layer, indicating a moderate thickness. Considering the size of each bread slice is roughly 10 cm by 6 cm, and the jam layer is spread thinly (about 2-3 mm thick), the volume of jam per slice is small. Strawberry jam has a density close to 1.3 g/cm3 due to sugar content and fruit pieces. Estimating the jam area coverage at approximately 30-40 cm2 per slice, and thickness at 0.2 cm, the volume per slice is around 6-8 cm3. Multiplying by the four slices gives around 24-32 cm3. Applying the density results in an estimated total weight of around 30-40 grams of strawberry jam. Given the moderate coverage and typical portion sizes in Swiss context, a reasonable estimate is 35 grams of strawberry jam on the plate."

The image shows four slices of bread with visible spread of butter beneath strawberry jam. The butter appears as a thin, somewhat uneven layer under the jam on each slice. Given the size of each slice (small to medium, typical of Swiss portions), a thin spread of butter on each slice is likely around 3 to 4 grams. Since butter is dense and spread thinly, the total butter weight across the four slices likely sums to about 12 to 16 grams. Considering visual thickness and coverage, I estimate the butter weight to be approximately 14 grams."

The target food item is 'crême fraîche aux herbes.' From the image, the cream with herbs is visible coating the peeled cooked shrimp on top and intermingled with the cooked pasta beneath. The container size is medium, and the cream appears to be a generous but not excessive layer, visible on shrimp and some pasta strands underneath. Given the cream's spread and volume, the depth is modestly thick, and considering Swiss portion sizes, it should be less than a large sauce portion. Typically, a portion of herb cream sauce like this on such a pasta dish would be around 30-50 grams. Considering the volume visible, I estimate it on the lower-middle of that range, about 40 grams."

The target food item is 'crevettes décortiquées cuites' (peeled cooked shrimps). In the image, there are about 9 visible peeled shrimp pieces on top of the pasta with cream sauce, fully coated with sauce. Each shrimp appears medium-sized, likely around 10-15 grams each based on typical shrimp size in Swiss portions. Considering these are cooked shrimps, their density is relatively high compared to vegetables but lighter than dense meat. The shrimp pieces are piled and partially overlap, but none seem hidden under the pasta, so count of visible pieces is reliable. Estimating an average weight of 12 grams per shrimp and multiplying by 9 pieces gives approximately 108 grams. Given no indication of extra hidden shrimps, and portion size suggesting a medium serving, this weight estimation is reasonable and consistent with Swiss portion sizes. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'crevettes décortiquées cuites' is 108 grams."

The target food item is 'pâtes aux crevettes'. In the image, the container shows a portion of cooked pasta topped with cooked, peeled shrimp ('crevettes décortiquées cuites') mixed with a creamy herb sauce. The pasta portion underneath is somewhat visible and occupies about half the depth of the container base. Standard Swiss portions for cooked pasta are generally smaller than US portions, with a typical single serving between 100 and 130 grams. The pasta is cooked and appears to be spaghetti or similar, likely weighing around 120 grams for the visible portion. The shrimp are larger in volume than the pasta but fewer in number—about 9-10 shrimp visible. Cooked peeled shrimp typically weigh about 8-10 grams each. Assuming an average of 9 shrimp at 9 grams each gives roughly 81 grams in shrimp. The creamy herb sauce adds volume but minimal weight likely below 30 grams and is part of the dish but not counted separately here as we're estimating the combined 'pâtes aux crevettes' dish. Therefore, combining pasta (120 g) and shrimp (81 g), and adding small margin for sauce, the total weight estimate for 'pâtes aux crevettes' is around 200 grams. This is reasonable given the container size, portion, and density of ingredients observed."

The image shows a rectangular plastic container with cooked pasta at the bottom, topped with shrimp covered in a creamy herb sauce. The target food to estimate is 'pâtes cuites' (cooked pasta). The pasta appears to be spaghetti or a similar type. By visual identification, the pasta is partially visible under the shrimp and sauce, filling the base of the container to a layer approximately 2-3 cm thick. The container size and the pasta volume suggest a single medium Swiss portion, smaller than typical US servings. Spaghetti cooked weight density is quite compact, roughly 140-160 grams per cup (about 250 ml). Given the observed volume about half the container's base and some depth, I estimate the cooked pasta volume to be about 1 to 1.5 cups. Therefore, the estimated cooked pasta weight should be between 140 and 200 grams. Considering some space taken by shrimp and sauce, a reasonable estimate is close to the middle of this range. Hence, I estimate the weight of the cooked pasta ('pâtes cuites') in this portion as approximately 170 grams."

The image shows two small round pieces of chèvre chaud on a white square plate. Each piece is about the size of a small ping-pong ball with a diameter roughly around 4-5 cm and a thickness of about 2-3 cm. Considering goat cheese is dense, the weight per piece is likely to be between 40 and 50 grams. Since there are two pieces visible, the total weight should be approximately 80 to 100 grams. Given the visual size and density, I estimate the combined weight of the two chèvres chauds to be about 90 grams."

The target food item is 'tomates cerises' (cherry tomatoes). In the image, there are 10 cherry tomatoes visible on the plate. Each tomato is roughly spherical with an estimated diameter of about 3 to 3.5 cm, similar to a typical cherry tomato size. A single cherry tomato in Swiss portion context usually weighs between 15 and 20 grams due to their density and water content. Considering the size consistency and no visible damage or partial tomatoes, I will assign an average weight of 17 grams per tomato. Multiplying 10 tomatoes by 17 grams each gives an estimated total weight of 170 grams for the cherry tomatoes. This accounts for their volume and density accurately with no hidden volume since they are whole and visible."

Each segment is about 10 cm long and roughly cylindrical with a diameter around 3.5 cm, based on comparison with the cherry tomatoes nearby. The carrots appear dense and firm, typical of fresh carrots. A whole medium carrot typically weighs about 60-70 grams. Since these are two halves close to a full carrot, the total weight should be near that value. Considering the slight peeling and size, I estimate the total weight of the two carrot pieces to be around 130 grams."

The glass appears to be roughly the size of a small espresso or dessert glass, approximately 6-7 cm tall and 5-6 cm in diameter. The panna cotta portion is the creamy white layer in the bottom half to two thirds of the glass, while the raspberry topping occupies the top third. Considering typical panna cotta density as a creamy, dense gelatin dessert, and the volume estimated visually as about 100-120 ml total, the panna cotta (excluding the raspberry topping weight) should be in the range of 90-110 grams. The raspberry topping is relatively thin, so it weighs less and is excluded from this estimation. Therefore, the panna cotta portion itself is conservatively estimated at about 100 grams, fitting a typical Swiss portion, smaller than US dessert servings."

The target food item is ratatouille, located on the right side of the plate. It is a mixture of cooked vegetables including zucchini, eggplant, and tomatoes. The vegetables appear diced into roughly 1-2 cm pieces. Visually, the ratatouille occupies a compact but modest volume on the plate, roughly the size of a medium scoop, about 8 cm by 6 cm in surface area with an estimated depth of about 2.5 cm, taking into account the typical stewed vegetable layering and some hidden depth that isn't obvious from the top view. Such cooked vegetables have fairly dense moisture content, so weight per volume is fairly substantial. Considering the Swiss portion context, which is typically smaller than US portions, I estimate the weight range to be approximately 110-140 grams. Choosing a medium portion size based on visual evidence (not overly heaping but a decent portion), an estimate near the middle of this range is appropriate. Therefore, I estimate the ratatouille to weigh approximately 125 grams."

The image shows a plate with four distinct food items: ratatouille, bulgur (boulgour), gruyère cheese strips, and a fried egg (oeuf au plat). The bulgur is located in the upper left to middle area of the plate and forms a mound about the size of a small fist, spreading over a moderate surface area on the plate. Comparing its size to the fried egg and the cheese strips, the bulgur mound appears compact and moderately thick, suggesting noticeable volume. Bulgur is a dense cooked grain, typically weighing more than its volume suggests due to moisture content. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes, and the visual bulk of the bulgur mound, it likely weighs between 120 and 160 grams. Given it is a medium-sized serving, I estimate approximately 140 grams for the bulgur on the plate."

The image shows three rectangular strips of gruyère cheese placed on the left side of the plate. Each strip is about the size of a typical cheese stick of roughly 8 cm long, 1 cm wide, and about 1 cm thick. Gruyère is a dense cheese, so these dimensions correspond to a relatively substantial weight. Given the density of gruyère (approximately 1.1 g/cm³), and estimating the volume as 3 sticks × 8 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm = 24 cm³, the weight is roughly 24 cm³ × 1.1 g/cm³ = 26.4 grams. Considering small visual uncertainties, I estimate the weight of the gruyère cheese on the plate to be approximately 26 grams."

The target food to estimate is 'oeuf au plat' (fried egg). In the image, the egg is fully visible and occupies a standard-sized portion on a dinner plate. Visually, the egg white covers a circular area roughly 9-10 cm in diameter, typical of a large egg. The yolk is intact and centrally located, appearing of normal size. Given the visible thickness and typical density of a fried egg, as well as considering Swiss portion sizes which tend to be slightly smaller than US portions, it is reasonable to estimate this as a single standard egg portion. A typical large fried egg weighs about 50 grams after cooking, accounting for water loss but no shell. The egg is uncut and appears normal in thickness without extra oil pooling. Therefore, the weight estimate for the oeuf au plat is 50 grams."

Each loaf is about the size of a small palm, approximately 7-8 cm in diameter, with a slightly rustic crust and visible walnut pieces. Swiss bread portions tend to be smaller than in some other countries. Given their size and typical density for bread with nuts, each loaf likely weighs around 70-90 grams. Since the request is to estimate for 'pains aux noix' (plural), but does not specify how many loaves to estimate, the safe assumption is to estimate for one piece. Taking a medium portion size in this range, the estimated weight for one 'pain aux noix' is about 80 grams."

Considering the visible dimensions and the known average density of apples, which are predominantly water and fibrous material, the weight is expected to be moderate. Swiss medium apples typically weigh between 130 and 180 grams. This apple does not appear unusually large or small, so placing it near the median of this range is appropriate. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this pomme to be around 160 grams."

The yogurt fills around 80% of the jar's height. Given the jar size and typical density of yogurt (close to water but slightly thicker), the total volume here is approximately 150-180 ml. Since 1 ml ~ 1 gram for yogurt, and accounting for the caramel layer inside, the total weight should be slightly less than the full volume. Considering a standard portion size for such a dessert in Switzerland is usually around 120-150 grams per jar, and this portion seems a medium one (not very full, not too empty), an estimate near the mid-range is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'yogourt caramel beurre salé' in this jar to be approximately 140 grams."

The biscuit appears to be dense, as it has both a glaze layer and jam filling, and its thickness looks around 0.8 to 1 cm. Considering similar types of jam-filled biscuits common in Swiss and European snacks, the average weight for such a biscuit typically ranges between 30 to 40 grams.

Considering a typical Swiss context, jam spreads are not applied very thickly. The visible quantity on each slice appears to be roughly 5 to 7 grams. With three slices, the total spread looks like approximately 15 to 20 grams of jam in total. Being conservative and accounting for partial absorption into the bread without visible pooling, I estimate the total weight of strawberry jam visible on the plate to be about 18 grams."

In the image, there are three bread rolls: two lighter brown ones that look like brioche au chocolat and one darker brown roll with visible walnut pieces, identified as the pain aux noix. The pain aux noix has a round shape with a rough surface and visible nuts embedded in the dough. Comparing its size to the brioche au chocolat pieces, it is roughly the same size as each brioche, about the size of a small bread roll usually served in Switzerland, which tends to be smaller than typical US rolls. Considering the density of a nut bread, which is denser than plain bread due to walnuts, and the visible volume, the estimated weight should reflect its compact form and added nuts. Small individual pain aux noix rolls typically weigh between 50 and 70 grams. Given the size and density apparent visually, I place this pain aux noix at a medium portion around 60 grams."

Each brioche appears similar in size to a small bread roll, approximately 7-8 cm in diameter. Compared to a palm size reference from common Swiss portion sizes, these are medium-sized single bread portions. Brioche dough is soft but dense with chocolate chips adding weight, so density is moderate to high. A typical small brioche au chocolat from bakery weighs between 55-75 grams depending on size and ingredients. Given the brioche looks slightly smaller than US large portions but average-sized for Swiss, I estimate the weight around the mid-range, approximately 65 grams for one brioche au chocolat."

The mozzarella is cut into small cubes and irregular chunks distributed fairly evenly across the bowl. I count roughly around 30-35 pieces of mozzarella. Each piece appears to be about 1 cm cubed on average. Considering the density of fresh mozzarella, which is moist and soft, 1 cubic centimeter corresponds roughly to 1 gram. Taking into account that some pieces are larger or clumped together and the depth of the bowl which indicates some of the mozzarella could be slightly buried beneath other ingredients, I estimate the total mozzarella weight to be around 50-60 grams. Given this is a Swiss portion, I will pick a moderate value of 55 grams for the mozzarella present."

Visually, I count approximately 8 olives scattered throughout the salad. Each olive appears medium-sized, typical of pitted or whole table olives. A single olive generally weighs about 4-5 grams depending on size and type. Considering these are whole and dense olives, I estimate each olive to be around 4.5 grams. Multiplying by 8 olives gives an estimated total weight of approximately 36 grams.

The green leaves can be seen as darker and lighter green parts spread throughout the bowl, mixed but present in a single layer with some volume. Considering Swiss portion sizes, and the fact that the green salad is mostly loose leaves which are relatively light, the volume occupies roughly the bottom half of the bowl but not densely packed. Visual comparison to the bowl and other items places the green salad portion at approximately 40-60 grams.

Step 1: Visual Identification - The cherry tomatoes appear cut into halves or quarters, scattered among leafy greens, mozzarella chunks, olives, and grilled vegetables. Counting the visible halves and quarters gives about 6 cherry tomatoes total (considering the pieces visible represent roughly halves of full tomatoes). Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Typical Swiss cherry tomatoes weigh between 15-20 grams each. The pieces appear consistent with standard size. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cherry tomatoes are watery and light but whole; weight includes skin. Step 4: Portion Calibration - The visible pieces correspond to about 6 full tomatoes, so multiplying 6 × 17 grams (average) = 102 grams. Step 5: Cross Validation - Since some pieces may be partially hidden or mixed, adjusting slightly downward to account for some hidden volume, I estimate the tomatoes to weigh about 90-105 grams. Choosing a medium portion in the range, I estimate 98 grams for the cherry tomatoes."

The target food item is 'légumes grillés,' which are visible as grilled vegetables pieces mixed in the bowl along with salad greens, olives, mozzarella, and cherry tomatoes. Visually, the grilled vegetables include recognizable chunks of red pepper and eggplant, dispersed throughout the salad rather than piled up, indicating a moderate volume. The bowl seems to be a small to medium size, based on the 2 walnut breads next to it, which are about 60-70 grams each in Swiss portions. The grilled vegetables cover about 20-25% of the bowl volume considering some layering beneath visible leaves. Grilled vegetables are dense and have some moisture loss but retain substantial density; estimating roughly 150-200 grams for a medium portion in this bowl size. Given the visible amount and typical portion sizes in Switzerland, with about half the top surface showing vegetables, I estimate the weight of the grilled vegetables at about 175 grams."

The target food item is 'pains aux noix' (walnut breads), visible at the top of the image on a white plate. There are two small round breads, typical bakery portion size in Switzerland. Each bread is about the size of a palm, generally weighing less than larger rolls. Given the density of grain bread with nuts, which is heavier than white bread but bread pieces are small, each bread typically weighs around 70 to 90 grams. Given these appear moderately sized and dense with visible walnut chunks, I estimate each to weigh about 80 grams on average. With two breads, total weight is approximately 160 grams. Since the question is for the weight of the item, not the combined weight unless plural, assuming the item refers to one bread, the estimate is 80 grams."

The image shows a plate with three food items: pâtes (pasta) on the bottom left with some mushroom sauce on top, courgettes gratinée in the upper right corner, and sauce aux champignons visible on the pasta. Focusing only on the pâtes, it is a single portion on a standard-sized dinner plate. The portion of pasta is loosely piled, showing typical fettuccine or tagliatelle width and thickness, appearing freshly cooked and moist. The visible surface area of the pasta occupies about one quarter of the plate's area. Considering the pasta appears cooked, dense, and compact with some sauce contributing moisture but no significant additional weight to the pasta itself. Comparing to the plate size and typical Swiss portion sizes which are smaller than US portions, an estimated depth of about 2 cm can be inferred. Typical cooked pasta density is roughly 140-160 g per 100 ml volume. Taking into account the shape and volume, this portion likely weighs between 110g to 140g, corresponding to a medium portion. I estimate the weight of the cooked pasta to be approximately 125 grams, balancing the visible size and Swiss smaller portion norms."

The target food item is 'sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon)'. From the image, the sauce is visibly covering and mixed with the mushrooms placed on top of the pasta. The sauce component appears creamy and lightly coats the visible mushroom slices. There are about 6 slices of mushroom covered with sauce. The sauce is not separately visible as a large volume but is integrated with the mushrooms, suggesting a thin layer. Considering that mushroom sauce is typically dense and creamy, and assuming the visible portion on the plate is the total portion served, the sauce including the visible mushroom pieces likely weighs about 50-70 grams. Because the mushrooms themselves have moderate weight and the sauce is creamy but not overly thick, I estimate the total weight of the 'sauce aux champignons' to be around 60 grams, representing a medium portion for this Swiss context."

The target food item is 'courgettes gratinée.' Visually, there are about 6 round slices of grilled or gratinated zucchini arranged on the side of the plate. Each slice appears medium thickness and cooked, which means slight shrinkage but retention of density. A typical cooked zucchini slice 1 cm thick and about 5-6 cm in diameter weighs roughly 20-25 grams. Considering the visible size and number of slices, the total volume corresponds to a medium portion. Thus, multiplying 6 slices by an average 22 grams gives approximately 132 grams. Taking into account the gratinée preparation which may add minimal weight but does not significantly change volume, I estimate the courgettes gratinée portion to be about 130 grams."

The image shows a nectarine on the left and a rhubarb muffin on the right. I am focusing only on the nectarine as requested. The nectarine is a medium-sized fruit with a typical shape and size. Compared to the muffin, a standard small Swiss muffin is roughly 50-60 mm in diameter, helping estimate the nectarine's size as typical for this fruit. Nectarines usually weigh between 130 and 180 grams depending on size. This nectarine looks average-sized, neither very small nor very large. Taking into account the density of stone fruits like nectarines and the visual appearance of the fruit's size relative to the muffin, I estimate the nectarine's weight to be around 150 grams."

The portion is approximately a compact mound about 7 cm wide, 4 cm deep, and 3 cm high, taking into account some hidden volume underneath. Considering the ingredients are dense cooked vegetables with creamy texture, the density is moderate to high. A typical cooked vegetable gratin portion of this size in a Swiss context would weigh roughly between 110 and 140 grams, and this looks like a medium portion within that range. Therefore, I estimate the weight at 125 grams."

The visible portion consists of cooked wheat grains that fill roughly one-third of the container's base and have some depth, appearing about 1.5 to 2 cm thick. The grains are dense and compact, with a slightly shiny surface indicating moisture. Comparing to the container size and estimating the volume occupied by the wheat grains, I approximate the quantity as a moderate portion commonly served in Swiss meals. Considering the dense nature of cooked wheat, with a typical density around 1.2 g/cm³, the portion is likely in the medium range of 120-160 grams. Given the visual evidence and the portion size, I estimate the weight of the blé to be approximately 140 grams."

The target food item is 'panais' (parsnip), visible as light beige, irregular, elongated chunks mixed with other vegetables and feta on a plate. Step 1: Visual Identification - I see about 4 to 5 pieces of parsnip mixed in the portion, interspersed with carrots, potatoes, beetroot, aubergine, and feta. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each parsnip piece is roughly the size of a sliced carrot piece, about 3-5 cm in length and 1.5-2.5 cm thick. The pieces appear roasted, so less volume shrinkage but similar density to cooked parsnip. Step 3: Density Considerations - Parsnip is a dense root vegetable, similar to carrots or potatoes but slightly more dense. Cooked root vegetables usually weigh around 0.8-1.0 g per cm3. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given the number of pieces and their size, the parsnip portion looks medium-sized on a Swiss plate. Estimating average piece weight about 20 grams (considering size and density), with 4-5 pieces total, resulting in approximately 80-100 grams total. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The total mixed portion does not seem large, and the parsnip proportion is moderate, so choosing middle value near 90 grams is reasonable and consistent with the visual volume and density. Therefore, the estimated weight of the parsnip portion is about 90 grams."

The target food is aubergines (eggplants) in a mixed roasted vegetable dish. Visually, the aubergine pieces are cut into medium-sized irregular chunks, roughly half to one inch thick, and there appear to be about 4 to 5 pieces visible based on size and overlapping. The aubergine pieces look cooked and roasted, which retains density but reduces size slightly. Comparing to the plate that is a standard dinner size (approximately 25-27 cm diameter), the aubergine pieces occupy a modest volume in the mix. Considering the density of cooked aubergine (somewhat spongy but moist), an average piece chunk likely weighs about 15-20 grams. Multiplying by 4-5 pieces gives roughly 65-100 grams total. Visually, this is a moderate portion on the plate, so I choose the middle of the range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the aubergines to be 80 grams."

These potato pieces appear similar in size to the carrot slices, roughly 2-3 cm in length per piece. There are about 9 visible potato pieces on the plate. Given the typical weight of potatoes (dense vegetable), each quarter piece likely weighs around 20-25 grams considering the Swiss portion size context. Multiplying 9 pieces by an average of 22 grams gives approximately 198 grams. Accounting for some smaller pieces and slight visual overlaps, a reasonable estimate would be between 180 and 210 grams. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the pommes de terre portion on the plate to be approximately 195 grams."

The image shows a mixed pile of roasted vegetables and feta cheese on a large plate. The feta pieces are scattered within the mix, appearing as small white chunks roughly around 1-2 cm each. I count approximately 6-8 visible pieces of feta mixed in with the vegetables. Considering standard feta density (around 2.5 g/cm³) and estimating each piece to be roughly 2 cm long, 1 cm wide, and 1 cm thick, each piece likely weighs about 5 grams. Multiplying by the 6 to 8 pieces visible yields a total estimated weight range of 30 to 40 grams. Given the portion looks standard and not particularly large, I estimate the feta quantity closer to the lower end, around 32 grams."

The target food item is 'carottes' (carrots), which are visible as orange slices mixed with other vegetables on a medium-sized dark plate. Step 1: I identify about 8 to 10 visible carrot slices, varying in size but generally about 1-1.5 cm thick and roughly 2-3 cm diameter. Step 2: Compared to the plate size and fork in the background, the carrot slices are roughly bite-sized. The portions are cut pieces, not whole carrots, showing a moderate volume but the carrot pieces are well spread in the mix so the visible count should be close to the total carrot amount. Step 3: Carrots are dense root vegetables, so weight tends to be higher than perceived volume. Step 4: Given the size and quantity, a small-medium portion corresponds to around 80-110 grams of carrots. Considering the portion is not very large but well represented, a mid-range estimate is suitable. Step 5: To avoid underestimation, I use about 100 grams for the carrot portion on the plate. This fits Swiss portion norms and the visible amount. Hence, the estimated weight of 'carottes' is 100 grams."

The dish contains various roasted vegetables and feta on a large plate, with the target food item being 'racines rouges' (beetroot). Visually, I can identify the racines rouges as the dark red-purple cubed pieces scattered throughout the pile. They are cut into small chunks approximately 2-3 cm across. I count about 7-8 pieces visible in the pile. Given the mixed nature of the dish, the beetroot pieces are somewhat embedded with other ingredients but clearly distinguishable. Considering the density of cooked beetroot, which is fairly dense and moist, each chunk likely weighs around 20-25 grams. Accounting for the visible 7-8 pieces and possible small hidden pieces underneath, a reasonable estimate of the total weight of the 'racines rouges' on the plate would be 160-200 grams. Given the medium portion size typical of Swiss servings and the visual estimation, I conclude approximately 180 grams is a precise estimate for the racines rouges weight here."

The target food item is 'sauce salade', which is visible as a white creamy sauce spread over the cucumber slices and a bit under the shrimp skewer. The amount appears to cover about 3-4 thin cucumber slices and has a thickness suggesting a moderate serving, but not a large pool of sauce. Comparing it to the size of the shrimps and plate, the volume looks to be approximately 1-2 tablespoons (15-30 ml). Salad dressing sauces typically have a density close to water or slightly thicker, roughly around 1 g/ml, so the weight in grams is close to the volume in milliliters. Given the moderate visible quantity, I estimate the weight of the 'sauce salade' to be around 20 grams, reflecting a small to medium portion consistent with Swiss portion sizes."

Each slice is approximately the size of a typical cucumber slice, with about 1-2 mm thickness and a diameter around 5-6 cm. Compared to the plate and the shrimp skewer, these slices appear quite thin and light. Cucumber is a light and water-dense vegetable, so the weight will be relatively low despite the visible surface area. Considering Swiss portion sizes, five thin cucumber slices typically weigh between 25-40 grams. Given the visible quantity and thinness, I estimate this portion of cucumber to weigh approximately 30 grams."

Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each shrimp is medium-sized, around 5 cm long without the tail, and appears fairly plump, approximately 1.5 cm thick. The shrimp are curled, indicating typical cooked shrimp size. Step 3: Density Considerations - Shrimp are dense and fairly heavy for their size due to muscle mass, with typical density around 1.1 g/cm³. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - A medium shrimp of this size in Swiss portion context commonly weighs about 15 grams each. Multiplying 15 grams by 4 shrimp gives 60 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Considering the visible plumpness and the number of shrimp, 60 grams is a reasonable estimate and accounts for the edible part alone without skewers or sauces. Therefore, the total estimated weight of the crevettes is 60 grams."

The target food item is 'sauce coktail'. The image shows two separate piles of sauce on the plate; the darker orange sauce is the 'sauce coktail' on the right side of the plate. It is presented as a small dollop approximately 3-4 cm in diameter and about 1-1.5 cm thick. By comparing the sauce portion to the other foods and the plate size, the sauce portion is modest and typical for a single serving of a condiment. Considering the density of cocktail sauce, which tends to be relatively thick but not heavy, the portion likely weighs between 25 and 40 grams. Given the modest amount visually present, a medium estimate of 30 grams is appropriate."
m4egh2,"salade de pâtes, cornichon, fromage, tomate",82.0,130.0,48.0,32.39622641509434,0.09706056421384888,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/7ff5fe61-b9cd-45c6-8df8-44a690a86b0c,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'salade de pâtes, cornichon, fromage, tomate'. On the plate, the pasta salad ('salade de pâtes') appears as a modest portion of cooked elbow macaroni with visible small pieces of cornichon (pickles) and some bits of cheese mixed in. The tomato is represented by one small cherry tomato on the skewer with the shrimp. Step 1: The pasta salad portion looks like a small heap measuring about 7 cm in diameter and 3 to 4 cm in height. Step 2: Given the dense nature of cooked pasta mixed with pickles and cheese, the overall density is relatively high. Typical densities for cooked pasta salads with added ingredients are around 0.8-1.0 g/cm3. Step 3: Estimating volume as a rough cylinder: area ~ π * (3.5 cm)^2 ≈ 38.5 cm2, height ~3.5 cm, volume ≈ 135 cm3. Using density ~0.9 g/cm3, weight estimate is about 120 grams for the pasta salad. Step 4: Pickles and cheese are integrated into the pasta salad; the cornichon pieces are small but visible and contribute small volume, cheese pieces are minimal but denser. The tomato on the skewer is a single small cherry tomato, typically about 10-15 grams. Step 5: Combining these, the total weight is approximately 120 grams (pasta salad) + 10 grams (tomato) = 130 grams. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of 'salade de pâtes, cornichon, fromage, tomate' on the plate to be around 130 grams."

The image shows a clear container with gnocchi au basilic, cauliflower florets, and grated cheese. The target food is ""gnocchi au basilic."" I start by visually identifying the gnocchi, which are the small, oblong, pale green pieces with visible basil specks, located mostly at the bottom and left side of the container. There are approximately 15 individual gnocchi pieces visible. Each gnocchi piece is roughly 3-4 cm long and about 1.5-2 cm thick, appearing dense and compact as typical cooked gnocchi. The gnocchi form a single layer with some slight overlap but no deep piling, so the volume can be estimated by count and average size rather than volume stacking. Given the density of cooked potato gnocchi with herbs, which is relatively high, each piece can weigh approximately 15-18 grams based on Swiss portion sizes. Multiplying the count (15) by an average of 16 grams results in a range of 225-270 grams. Considering the portion size looks medium rather than large or very small, I estimate the gnocchi au basilic weight to be about 240 grams, accounting for density and slight variation in piece size. The cheese is only lightly scattered on top and the cauliflower is separate, so they do not add to the gnocchi weight."

The target food is chou-fleur (cauliflower). In the image, there are approximately 7 visible pieces of cauliflower, varying in size but generally medium-large florets. The cauliflower pieces take up roughly one-third of the container's volume. Comparing to the gnocchi and shredded cheese nearby, and assuming a Swiss portion size which is smaller, each cauliflower floret likely weighs around 20-25 grams considering their density and volume. Accounting for visible pieces plus slight hidden portions beneath others, a reasonable total weight estimate falls between 130 and 180 grams. Choosing a conservative medium portion, my estimate for the cauliflower is approximately 155 grams."

The image shows a transparent container with gnocchi au basilic, cauliflower florets, and grated cheese ('fromage râpé') on top. I have to estimate only the weight of the grated cheese. The grated cheese is sparsely distributed over the cauliflower and gnocchi, mostly covering the top with thin, fine shreds. Given the visible amount and typical cheese density, this looks like a light sprinkling rather than a heavy topping. The cheese layer depth is very thin, approximately less than 0.5 cm overall, and it is not densely packed. Comparing to commonly known amounts, a light sprinkle on this portion usually ranges around 5 to 15 grams. Considering the moderate coverage and moderate thickness, I estimate the weight of the grated cheese to be about 10 grams, a moderate portion of grated cheese over the dish without excess."

The image shows a single slice of bread (pain) on a flat surface. The piece is rustic with an airy crumb structure, indicating it is a light bread with a crusty edge. Visually, the slice measures roughly 8 cm in length and about 5 cm in width, with an average thickness of about 2 cm. Given the air pockets inside, the bread density is relatively low compared to denser bread types. A typical slice of similar artisan-style bread weighs approximately 25-35 grams. Considering this is a small slice with a fairly open crumb, I estimate its weight toward the lower end of the range. Therefore, the slice of bread weighs approximately 28 grams."

The image shows a single whole greenish-yellow apple placed on a desk, providing size context with visible cables and a USB plug nearby. The apple appears medium-sized typical for Swiss portions, with an approximate diameter between 7-8 cm. Standard medium apples in Switzerland weigh around 150 to 180 grams. The apple appears dense and fresh, so I will use the mid-range of this weight estimate. Since there is only one apple and it is fully visible with no parts missing, the estimated weight is around 160 grams."
m4egh2,biscuit,8.0,12.0,4.0,30.938144329896907,0.000789110278161373,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/5350f0cd-e92a-44fc-9770-13b4bcca327e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a glass dessert with multiple components including ice cream scoops, meringue, kiwi slices, biscuit pieces, and some sauce. Focusing only on the biscuit, I identify several broken and small pieces scattered mostly on top of the ice cream. The biscuit fragments are thin and crispy, appearing to be a light, wafer-like texture. Given the visible size of each piece (approximately 4-5 cm across) but thinness and fragility, each piece is likely around 3-5 grams. Visually, there are about 3-4 significant biscuit pieces visible, suggesting a total biscuit weight in the range of 10-15 grams. Given the light and airy nature of the biscuit and limited volume occupied in the glass, I estimate the biscuit weight conservatively at about 12 grams."

The meringue is clearly visible sticking out at the top left of the glass. It appears to be a single piece of classic meringue, shaped with some rounded peaks. The size can be compared to the ice cream scoops and the glass rim: it is about 5 cm tall and about 3-4 cm wide. Meringue is light and airy, so despite its volume, it has a low density—typically around 0.3 g/cm³. Given the approximate volume here (roughly shaped as a small cylinder or cone with a height of about 5 cm and diameter around 3.5 cm), the volume could be estimated around 30-40 cm³. Multiplying by density, we get about 9-12 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes and the visual appearance that this is a small-medium meringue piece, the estimation should be near the middle of this range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the meringue to be approximately 10 grams."

The image shows a dessert glass containing two visible scoops of ice cream ('boules de glace'). Each scoop is roughly the size of a small tennis ball, approximately 5-6 cm in diameter. Typical ice cream density is about 0.5 to 0.6 g/cm3 due to air content, and a standard small scoop weighs around 50-60 grams. Here, there are two scoops visible. Considering Swiss portion sizes tend to be smaller than American, and the scoops look compact and well-shaped, I estimate each scoop weighs about 55 grams. Therefore, the total weight of the ice cream scoops in the glass is approximately 110 grams."

The kiwi is visible as thin slices embedded inside the glass, with several pieces stacked around the edges. Counting the slices, there appear to be about 4 to 5 thin kiwi slices visible. Each slice is roughly 0.5-0.7 mm thick and about 4-5 cm in diameter, which matches a typical kiwi slice thickness and size. Considering the kiwi is relatively light and watery but dense enough due to its flesh, fresh kiwi usually weighs about 40-50 grams in total for a typical small to medium fruit. Given the visible slices correspond roughly to half a small kiwi fruit, I estimate the weight of the kiwi portion here to be around 30 grams, factoring in the thin slices and some hidden slices inside the glass volume."

The target food item 'salade' is the leafy green base on the plate, made mostly of lettuce. Visually, the salade covers the entire bottom of the plate and is visible around the edges beneath the tomato cerise, thon, avocado, and corn. The salad appears chopped into thin strips. The plate is medium-sized, and the salade layer looks thinly spread about 1-1.5 cm deep in some parts. Lettuce is a light food with low density, so it tends to appear larger than its weight would suggest. Considering the volume under the toppings and the light density, the weight of the salade is likely in the small to medium portion range. Typically, a medium portion of chopped lettuce salad on such a plate ranges between 40 to 70 grams. Given the visible volume here, I estimate the salade weight at about 55 grams."

The image shows a salad plate including pieces of lettuce, cherry tomatoes, canned corn, chunks of tuna, and slices of avocado. The target food item is 'avocat' (avocado). Visually, there are approximately 3 medium-length slices of avocado, each about 5-6 cm long and about 1.5-2 cm wide and roughly 0.5 cm thick. The avocado pieces are reasonably thick slices, giving a moderate volume. Avocado has a dense, buttery texture and typically weighs around 150-170 grams per whole fruit. Given that these are slices making up roughly 1/4 to 1/3 of a whole avocado, the avocado quantity visually corresponds to approximately 40-55 grams. Considering portion sizes in Switzerland tend to be smaller, this looks like a medium avocado portion, so I estimate the avocado weight to be about 50 grams."

The image shows a salad plate with several visible food items, among which the cherry tomatoes (tomate cerise) are clearly identifiable. I count approximately 9 whole cherry tomatoes, with some cut in half. Cherry tomatoes are roughly the size of a small egg, about 2.5-3 cm in length and 2 cm in diameter, and typically weigh around 15-20 grams each. Considering Swiss portion sizes and the tomatoes appearing fresh and plump, I will use an average weight of 17 grams per tomato. Multiplying by 9 tomatoes gives around 153 grams. However, since some of them are halved and there may be a small variation, I adjust slightly down to about 140 grams to account for size differences and partial visibility. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the cherry tomatoes on the plate to be approximately 140 grams."

The target food item is 'maïs en boîte' (canned corn), which is the yellow corn kernels visibly spread on top of the salad on a medium-sized plate. Step 1: Visual Identification - The corn is finely granular, spread in a moderately thick layer covering the tuna and part of the vegetables, appearing as loose kernels rather than a compact mass. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The plate diameter is roughly standard (about 22-24 cm). The corn covers an area of approximately 12 cm diameter with a depth roughly estimated as 0.8 to 1 cm since the kernels pile slightly but not densely. Estimating volume = surface area * depth ~ (π * 6^2 cm^2) * 1 cm approx = 113 cm^3. Step 3: Density Considerations - Canned corn has a density close to 0.7 to 0.8 g/cm^3 due to moisture content and void spaces between kernels. Using 0.75 g/cm^3 as reasonable. Step 4: Weight Estimation - 113 cm^3 * 0.75 g/cm^3 = about 85 grams. Step 5: Portion Size Calibration - The corn appears to be a medium portion on the salad, not overly filled or sparse. Adjusting slightly down to approx 80 grams for Swiss portion context. Cross-validation: This aligns well with usual canned corn portion sizes on salads. Therefore, I estimate the weight of 'maïs en boîte' on the plate as approximately 80 grams."

The image shows a plate of salad with several ingredients, among them the target food item, 'thon' (tuna), which is placed in several chunks across the plate and topped partially by corn. Step 1: Visual Identification - The tuna is visible as pink, flaky pieces distributed mainly in the center and left of the plate, roughly separated into 3-4 medium-sized chunks. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Comparing the tuna pieces to the cherry tomatoes and corn kernels, as well as the plate size (standard dessert plate approx. 20 cm diameter), the tuna roughly occupies an area about 12 cm by 6 cm if combined into a single mass, with moderate thickness (~1.5-2 cm). Step 3: Density Considerations - Tuna is dense and compact; even a small volume can have significant weight. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given the visual volume and customary Swiss portion sizes, a medium portion of chunk tuna in salad like this would likely be between 90-140 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - Avoiding overestimation due to loose flaking and corn partly covering it, and noting some tuna is under the corn, I estimate the visible and total tuna portion at about 120 grams. This estimation considers typical salad tuna cans or jars (usually 120-150 grams drained) and visual density on the plate."

The target food item is 'gratin de côte de bette', which is located at the bottom right part of the plate. Visually, it appears as a small rectangular portion, occupying about one sixth of the plate's surface. The gratin consists of cooked chard stems and leaves with a creamy cheese or béchamel sauce, baked until slightly browned on top. Considering the size of the plate (standard dinner plate, approximately 25 cm diameter) and the gratin portion covering roughly 6-7 cm by 4-5 cm, with an estimated depth of 1.5-2 cm, this equates to a small but dense food volume. Cooked vegetables gratin with creamy sauce is dense, so density considerations lead to moderately high weight per volume. The estimated volume roughly corresponds to around 50-70 grams. Given the Swiss portion context and the visible thickness and texture, I estimate the gratin de côte de bette weight as approximately 60 grams."

The target food item is 'salade de pomme de terre' which is the potato salad visible on the plate. Visually, it occupies roughly one third of the plate on the right side. The salad consists of small cubed pieces of cooked potatoes mixed with a creamy dressing and some small bits of herbs and possibly ham or onion, making it denser and heavier. The portion appears moderately sized and fairly compact, with some thickness visible indicating a decent volume. Given the plate’s diameter is a standard dinner plate (~25 cm), and the potato salad covers about 1/3 of it with a depth roughly 2-3 cm, the volume corresponds to a medium Swiss portion. Cooked potatoes are dense, so the weight is heavier than it looks. Estimating a medium portion of potato salad between 180 to 230 grams, I place the estimate around 210 grams as a balanced number considering density and volume."

The plate contains four items: bulgur, ratatouille, tomme panée, and green salad. The bulgur is at the bottom right of the plate, forming a roughly triangular pile roughly 10 cm wide and 6-7 cm deep, with a slight height but somewhat flat. Bulgur is a dense cooked grain, so it has significant weight per volume. Comparing its volume to the plate size (standard dinner plate approx 25 cm diameter), this bulgur portion looks like a typical side serving size in Switzerland—medium portion, likely between 140 and 180 grams. Considering the density of cooked bulgur (approximately 1.1g/ml) and the volume visually, the portion seems closer to medium size at around 160 grams, not overfilled but full enough. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the bulgur on this plate to be approximately 160 grams."

The target food item is 'salade verte,' which occupies the bottom left portion of the plate. The salad consists mainly of romaine or butter lettuce leaves, lightly dressed with what appears to be a vinaigrette. Visually, the portion covers about one quarter of the plate surface with loosely piled leaves, and the depth appears shallow, roughly 2-3 cm thick. Considering lettuce is a light food with low density, its actual weight is significantly lower than its volume might suggest. In Swiss portion context, this leafy green salad portion is moderate, likely corresponding to a typical side salad serving. A typical side salad portion of leafy greens without heavy additions weighs between 40 and 60 grams. Given the visible mass, size, and light dressing, I estimate the salad verte weighs approximately 50 grams."

The target food is 'ratatouille,' which is located centrally on the plate, comprising a mix of diced cooked vegetables including zucchini, eggplant, red peppers, and black olives, with a garnish of basil on top. The ratatouille portion covers about one-quarter of a standard Swiss-sized plate and is layered moderately thick, showing good volume and density typical for cooked vegetables that retain moisture. The pieces are roughly 1-2 cm cubes with visible sauce, contributing to some additional weight. Considering cooked vegetables have moderate density and the portion size is medium, I estimate a weight range between 130 g to 180 g. Given the visible volume and plate coverage along with typical density, I place the estimate closer to the middle-upper end at approximately 160 grams for the ratatouille."

The image shows a white square plate with four food items: bulgur, ratatouille, tomme panée, and salade verte. The target food item is 'tomme panée', a breaded and cooked cheese patty located at the top left of the plate. It looks circular and approximately 7-8 cm in diameter, with a thickness of about 1.5-2 cm. Comparing it to the fork length partly visible at the left and the lettuce size, the tomme panée portion is a small individual patty, typical for a single serving. Given the density of cheese and the breading, it is denser than vegetables but lighter than compact meats. Typically, a pan-fried breaded cheese patty of this size weighs between 70 and 100 grams. This particular piece appears medium-sized rather than overly large or small. Considering the Swiss portion context which tends to be moderate, I settle on the middle of the estimated range. Therefore, the tomme panée weighs approximately 85 grams."

Comparing its size to the slices of bread and the taboulé portion, the cheese wedge appears to be about 6 cm long, 4 cm wide at the base, and about 2.5 cm thick. Given the typical density of reblochon, which is a semi-soft cheese with moderate moisture content, the density is approximately 1.03 g/cm³. Estimating the volume as a wedge (roughly a triangular prism shape), the volume would be approximately 6 cm * 4 cm * 2.5 cm / 2 = 30 cm³. Multiplying volume by density gives about 31 grams. Considering this is a small portion, typical for Swiss cheese servings, I estimate the weight of the reblochon to be around 30 grams."
8japfq,taboulé aux poivrons et tomates,136.0,95.0,41.0,29.075000000000003,0.13750246596961926,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/8cc023af-a7ff-499f-8a9b-454ef2e943ae,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is ""taboulé aux poivrons et tomates,"" which is clearly visible on the left side of the plate as a grain salad with visible chopped red and yellow bell peppers and some greens. The portion occupies roughly a quarter to a third of a standard-sized dinner plate, with some pieces spilling slightly beyond the main pile. Considering the plate diameter is about 25 cm, the taboulé portion is approximately 10 cm across and piled about 2.5 cm high on average. Taboulé is primarily made from soaked bulgur, which is dense and moist, plus the added vegetables, which retain some weight. Given the density and volume of the taboulé and the visible vegetable content, I estimate the weight in the range of 85-110 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes tend to be smaller than US sizes, and this looks like a medium portion of taboulé, I estimate around 95 grams."
8japfq,caviar d'aubergine,8.0,40.0,32.0,29.075000000000003,0.006312882225290984,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/8cc023af-a7ff-499f-8a9b-454ef2e943ae,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'caviar d'aubergine', which is the creamy spread visible on the top slice of bread on the right side of the plate. Visually, the caviar covers nearly the entire surface of a medium slice of seeded bread, approximately 12 cm by 6 cm. The spread thickness appears moderate, about 3-5 mm, forming a thin but even layer typical for such spreads. Eggplant spreads have a medium density, similar to thick vegetable purees. Given Swiss portion sizes are smaller, and considering bread slice weight is excluded, the spread portion here is likely between 30 and 50 grams. I estimate a moderate portion size of about 40 grams for this visible amount of caviar d'aubergine."
8japfq,tapenade olive noire,9.0,24.0,15.0,29.075000000000003,0.0033290589859932924,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/8cc023af-a7ff-499f-8a9b-454ef2e943ae,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The 'tapenade olive noire' is the dark paste spread on one slice of seed bread on the bottom of the plate. Visually, it is spread in a thin, even layer covering almost the entire surface of the bread slice. The slice of bread is a typical European seeded bread slice, roughly 12cm by 6cm and about 1.5cm thick. Assuming the tapenade layer is about 3-4mm thick, we can calculate the volume. Bread density and weight are excluded, so focusing on tapenade alone which is a dense olive paste with some oil: the density is roughly 0.9 to 1 g/cm3. The area covered is approximately 72 cm2 (12x6 cm), thickness around 0.3-0.4 cm, giving a volume around 21-29 cm3. Using density about 0.95g/cm3 results in a weight range of approximately 20 to 28 grams. Considering this portion looks to be a moderate spread, I estimate closer to the middle of that range at 24 grams."
8japfq,pain aux graines,47.0,60.0,13.0,29.075000000000003,0.015067074373643716,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/8cc023af-a7ff-499f-8a9b-454ef2e943ae,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'pain aux graines,' which refers to the seeded bread slices on the plate. There are two visible slices of this bread. Each slice is approximately the size of a typical sliced piece of artisanal seeded bread, slightly smaller than a US-sized slice, consistent with Swiss portion sizes. The bread slices are about 1.5 cm thick. The first slice is covered with black olive tapenade and has a piece taken out, slightly reducing its weight, while the second slice is topped with caviar d'aubergine, and appears whole. A typical slice of seeded bread in Swiss context weighs around 30-40 grams. Considering the visible size, thickness, and that one slice has a bite taken out (around 20% missing), the total weight of both slices combined is roughly 60 grams (around 35g for the full slice and 25g for the bitten slice). Thus, the estimated weight of 'pain aux graines' on the plate is approximately 60 grams."

The sandwich au chèvre chaud is a long baguette-style sandwich, approximately 25-30 cm in length based on the visual comparison to the drinking glass and other items on the table. The bread appears dense and crusty, typical of a French baguette, estimated to weigh about 150-180 grams for this size. Inside the sandwich, there is a visible layer of melted warm goat cheese, which is dense and likely around 60-80 grams based on typical portion size for a warm goat cheese sandwich. Additionally, there is a moderate amount of shredded lettuce, which is lightweight and likely accounts for about 10-15 grams. Taking into account the density of the bread and cheese and the visible portion size filling the length of the sandwich, I estimate the total weight of the sandwich au chèvre chaud filling (bread plus cheese and lettuce) to be approximately 220 grams. Since the target is the sandwich, this includes the bread and filling but excludes any packaging or plates which are not included, perfectly aligned with the input. Therefore, the total estimated weight is 220 grams."

The image shows a stack of four Blevita crackers placed on a wooden surface. Each cracker is rectangular and thin, with visible small holes and the embossed brand name 'blevita'. The size of each cracker can be roughly compared to the grain of the wooden surface, indicating a standard biscuit size of about 6 x 4 cm and a thickness of approximately 3-4 mm per cracker. Blevita crackers are typically light but dense, with a known average weight around 12 grams per single cracker in Swiss portion context. Since there are four crackers stacked, the total weight is approximately 4 times 12 grams, equalling about 48 grams. No container weight is included, and the crackers appear whole and unbroken. Therefore, the estimated weight of the specified food item 'blevita' is 48 grams."

The target food is 'myrtilles' (blueberries), which are visible in a metal bowl atop a layer of yogurt and topped with sliced almonds. The blueberries are clearly distinct and countable. I count approximately 20 blueberries. Each blueberry, based on typical size and density, weighs about 1-2 grams. Considering some variation in size and the fact that some blueberries are partially hidden within the toppings, I'll estimate an average weight of approximately 1.5 grams per blueberry. Hence, the total weight of blueberries is roughly 20 x 1.5 = 30 grams. Given the Swiss context of generally smaller portions, this estimate aligns well with a medium portion size."
8japfq,amandes en bâtonnets,18.0,15.0,3.0,28.297709923664122,0.001331623594397317,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/94c187a1-2cee-4ec0-8a37-61761b7852a8,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is ""amandes en bâtonnets"" (slivered almonds) which are clearly visible as small, thin strips scattered on top of the yogurt and blueberries. By counting and estimating, there are roughly 35-45 small almond slivers. An average almond stick weighs about 0.5g, but these are relatively small and thin pieces, so the total weight might be slightly less per piece, around 0.4g each. Multiplying 40 pieces by 0.4g gives an estimated total around 16 grams. Considering some pieces could be broken or hidden, and portion size typical for Swiss small servings, a reasonable estimate would be about 15 grams for the amandes en bâtonnets, excluding any container or other food items' weight."
8japfq,yaourt nature,178.0,150.0,28.0,28.297709923664122,0.12290392582363385,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/94c187a1-2cee-4ec0-8a37-61761b7852a8,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is ""yaourt nature"" (plain yogurt), visible at the bottom of the bowl under the blueberries and almond sticks. The bowl is small and stainless steel, with a diameter around 10-12 cm, typical for a small dessert or snack portion. The yogurt layer appears to be about 2-3 cm deep given the visible volume and bowl shape. Given the density of plain yogurt (approximately 1 g/cm3), and estimating the yogurt volume occupies about 150 ml (considering some displacement by the toppings), the weight is roughly 150 grams. As Swiss portions tend to be smaller, this seems a medium-small portion of natural yogurt. Therefore, the estimated weight of the ""yaourt nature"" is about 150 grams."
m4egh2,sushi,202.0,230.0,28.0,28.0,0.13947524166502268,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/d0748362-06d9-46fd-8b1a-158d43215b97,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with 10 pieces of sushi rolls of various types, including tuna, salmon, avocado, and some with sesame or fish roe on the outside. Each piece is roughly cylindrical, approximately 3-4 cm in diameter and about 3 cm in height. Sushi rolls of this size typically weigh between 20-25 grams each, given their dense rice and fish content balanced with avocado and other fillings. The total weight for all pieces considered individually would be around 200-250 grams. However, since the target is the weight of the sushi as a single combined item (all pieces on the plate), and considering Swiss portion sizes are on the smaller side, I estimate the total sushi weight on the plate to be approximately 230 grams."
8japfq,nectarine,122.0,150.0,28.0,28.0,0.08423752219372657,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/71ef6b05-37a4-4f22-9ce5-0226e8b83294,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single nectarine held in a person's hand, which provides a clear scale reference. The nectarine appears to be medium-sized, fitting comfortably within the palm and covering about three fingers in width. Typical medium-sized nectarines weigh between 130 and 180 grams. Given its round shape, visible skin, and apparent density as a juicy stone fruit, this nectarines' weight is consistent with the middle of that range. Therefore, estimating conservatively with Swiss portion sizes, the nectarine in the image likely weighs about 150 grams."
6fwmw2,parmesan râpé,10.0,7.0,3.0,27.772727272727273,0.0007397908857762872,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/6fwmw2/dish_media/5b6177d5-0d26-4a44-8697-8f007fe9ff1c,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'parmesan râpé' visible primarily as grated cheese sprinkled over two fried eggs. By assessing the visual quantity, the grated Parmesan is a light, fine layer covering the egg yolks and some surrounding egg whites. Typically, a light sprinkle of grated Parmesan on two eggs is about 5 to 10 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes and the conservative amount visible, it looks closer to a modest 7 grams. Given the fine distribution without a thick heap, the weight is best estimated at the mid to low end of that range."
6fwmw2,haricots coco,86.0,75.0,11.0,27.772727272727273,0.02332807259814559,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/6fwmw2/dish_media/5b6177d5-0d26-4a44-8697-8f007fe9ff1c,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'haricots coco,' which refers to broad green beans visible on the right side of the plate. There are about 7 beans, averaging around 10-12 cm in length each. Compared to the plate (standard small dinner plate ~22 cm diameter), the beans appear to have a reasonable thickness and length, and are cooked but still firm, which suggests moderate density. Considering their volume and typical density, a single haricot coco bean weighs around 10-12 grams. With 7 beans visible, the total weight is estimated at about 75 grams. The beans are not layered or compressed deeply, so depth is simply their natural thickness. Given the Swiss portion context, this estimate is conservative but realistic."
6fwmw2,œufs au plat,94.0,90.0,4.0,27.772727272727273,0.009272045768396133,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/6fwmw2/dish_media/5b6177d5-0d26-4a44-8697-8f007fe9ff1c,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'œufs au plat' (fried eggs). Visually, there are two fried eggs on the plate, sunny side up, sprinkled with some seasoning and grated cheese. The eggs occupy a significant portion of the plate, which is a standard dinner plate of about 24 cm diameter. Each egg yolk appears whole and intact, indicating typical size. Fried eggs generally weigh slightly less than raw eggs as some water content evaporates during cooking, but the difference is not large. A standard large egg weighs around 50-55 grams raw; cooked, a fried egg weighs approximately 43-50 grams. Since these appear to be normal-sized eggs, I will estimate each egg as 45 grams cooked. Therefore, two eggs together weigh about 90 grams. The cheese on top is minimal and separately accounted for, so not included. Hence, the estimated total weight for the two fried eggs (œufs au plat) is about 90 grams."

The target food is 'semoule' (semolina). The semolina is in a small mound on the plate, situated between the two fried eggs and the green beans. Visually, it takes up about a quarter of the plate's surface area. Comparing to the size of the eggs and the plate, the semolina portion appears modest but sufficient for a side serving. Semolina is relatively dense and cooked semolina tends to hold moisture, adding to weight. Considering Swiss portion sizes tend to be smaller, I estimate the semolina mound to measure about 100-120 grams. Given the visible depth and slightly compact volume, I place the estimate toward the middle of this range at around 110 grams."

The target food item is 'boulgour'. In the image, the bulgur is located on the top right area of the plate as a loose pile of small, cooked grains. It appears to cover roughly a third of the plate's surface, with a moderate height indicating some depth, likely around 1.5 to 2 cm. The plate size looks like a standard small to medium Swiss plate (around 22-24 cm diameter) based on the size of the egg and cherry tomatoes. Cooked bulgur is dense and compact, so the visible volume would correspond closely to its weight. Comparing the bulgur pile to the egg size, the bulk seems roughly equivalent to about 120 to 150 grams of cooked bulgur. The portion is neither very small nor excessively large; it looks like a medium-sized serving typical for a balanced meal. Taking these factors into consideration, I estimate the weight of bulgur on the plate to be approximately 135 grams."

The target food item is 'tomates cerises' (cherry tomatoes). Visually, there are 12 cherry tomatoes on the plate, both round and slightly elongated types, averaging about the size of a large grape or small plum cherry tomato. Comparing their size to the fried egg and the plate diameter, each tomato is approximately 3-4 cm in length. Cherry tomatoes typically weigh about 15 grams each in such size. Considering Swiss portion sizes and the fact that some tomatoes are slightly smaller, I estimate an average weight of about 14 grams per tomato. Multiplying by 12 pieces gives an estimated total of approximately 168 grams. There's no visible damage or missing parts that would reduce weight, and they are whole with skin intact, so no deduction is necessary."

The feta is located in the bottom right of the plate as a solid block. Visually, it appears as a rectangular piece approximately 4 cm wide, 4 cm tall, and about 1.5 cm thick. Comparing it to the adjacent olives and the fried egg, the feta block looks like a typical serving size. Feta cheese is dense and slightly crumbly, which means it is heavier than it looks for its volume. Given the size and density, a standard 4x4x1.5 cm piece of feta usually weighs between 60g and 80g. This portion seems a medium serving, so I estimate it closer to the middle of this range, around 70 grams."

The target food item to estimate is 'pousses de graines' (sprouts). These are located on the left side of the plate and appear as a small pile of mixed bean sprouts. I see approximately 25-30 sprouts together, forming a compact but light cluster. Comparing the sprouts to cherry tomatoes nearby, which each weigh about 10-15 grams, the sprouts have less density and volume. Given typical density of sprouts, they tend to be light and fluffy but still some weight in their moisture content. The pile is about the size of two tablespoons. Considering Swiss portion sizes, this is a small to medium portion, with typical density around 30-40 grams per 100 ml (volume). Estimating the portion volume as roughly 30-40 ml, the weight for this portion would be approximately 12 grams. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'pousses de graines' to be around 12 grams."

The target food is the 'oeuf au plat' (fried egg), which is located at the bottom left of the plate. Visually, it covers about the size of a small palm, typical for a single large egg fried with a spread of egg white and a visible yolk in the center. The egg white spreads out thinly in places but has some thickness particularly near the yolk, and the yolk itself remains intact and slightly raised. Considering the visual size as compared to the cherry tomatoes and the estimated plate size, this is consistent with a single large egg. A typical large fried egg weighs approximately 50 grams once cooked, accounting for slight weight loss due to moisture evaporation. Given the visual evidence and Swiss portion norms that tend to be relatively moderate, the fried egg on this plate likely weighs about 50 grams."

The image shows a metal bowl containing a mixture of yaourt nature (natural yogurt) and muesli nature. The target food item to estimate is 'yaourt nature.' Visually, the yogurt is partially covered by the muesli but is visible as a creamy white portion mainly on the right side of the bowl and a small scoop towards the bottom center. The bowl is medium-sized, with the yogurt layer appearing to be about 2 to 3 cm deep underneath the muesli. The muesli covers a substantial surface area, and the yogurt underneath looks to be a moderate portion. Given the visible amount and the standard density of natural yogurt (approximately 1.03 g/ml), and considering Swiss portions tend to be smaller than US portions, the yogurt amount appears to be around 100-120 grams. Choosing a conservative middle estimate within that range due to some coverage by muesli and the bowl size, I estimate the weight of the yaourt nature to be approximately 110 grams."

The image shows a metal bowl containing muesli with a visible portion of natural yogurt underneath. The target food is 'muesli nature'. The muesli appears to form a layer covering most of the bowl surface, with an average depth around 1.5 to 2 cm, based on the size and shape of the bowl which resembles a small cereal bowl of about 15 cm diameter. The muesli pieces are visible oats and grains, which are relatively dense but bulky. Given the Swiss portion context, this looks like a small to medium serving of muesli, not a large one. Based on typical densities and serving sizes, a roughly 2 cm thick layer of muesli filling about 2/3 of the bowl could weigh around 40 to 55 grams. Considering the quantity visible and the compactness of the grains on top of the yogurt, I estimate the weight of the muesli to be approximately 50 grams."

The image shows a single banana placed next to a laptop keyboard, which provides a good size reference. The banana is medium-sized, not overly large or very small. Typically, a medium banana weighs between 110 and 130 grams when including the peel. Given this banana's visual size relative to the laptop keys, it fits within the medium range. Bananas have a fairly consistent density, and the peel weight is included in standard banana weights, but as per the instructions, we consider the banana as a whole here because it is unpeeled. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this banana to be around 120 grams."

The image shows a total of 10 cherries ('cerises') scattered on a textured surface for scale. Each cherry appears medium sized, typical for fresh cherries, approximately 2.5 to 3 cm in diameter. Cherries usually weigh about 7 to 9 grams individually, including the skin and flesh, with stems excluded as per the rules. Considering Swiss portion sizes which tend to be moderate, I estimate an average weight of 8 grams per cherry. Multiplying the count of 10 cherries by 8 grams gives a total weight of about 80 grams. This accounts adequately for the visible volume, density, and size of the cherries as shown in the image."

The image shows one whole peeled carrot on a flat surface. The carrot appears to be of medium thickness and length typical for a single carrot approximately 15-18 cm long and about 3-4 cm in diameter. Considering the typical density of a carrot and the size relative to the flat surface and the shadow for depth perception, the carrot's weight is likely between 60-90 grams. This size is consistent with a medium carrot commonly found in Swiss portions, so a conservative middle estimate is appropriate."

The target food item is 'salade verte', which is the mixed green salad visible on the right side of the plate. The salad consists mainly of leafy greens such as lettuce and arugula. I will carefully estimate the volume and weight based on the amount of leaves present. The salad covers roughly one third of the plate's surface area but is relatively thin and light, typical for a side salad portion in Switzerland, which tends to be smaller than US portions. Leafy greens are low density and appear larger than their actual weight. Considering the size of the plate as a reference (roughly 26cm diameter), the salad portion is approximately 50-70 grams of leafy greens, typical for a small to medium side salad. Given no visible heavy dressing weight and the fluffiness of the greens, I estimate the weight of the 'salade verte' to be about 60 grams."

The target food item is olives, located at the bottom left of the plate. There are 7 individual olives visible, medium-sized and coated with some marinade. Each olive typically weighs between 4 to 6 grams depending on size and marinade presence. Considering these olives are somewhat plump and marinated, I estimate about 5 grams per olive on average. Multiplying 7 olives by 5 grams gives approximately 35 grams. Given the Swiss portion context, this portion is medium-sized, so I will keep it around 35 grams without additional adjustments."

The image shows a plate with three clearly separated food items: mozzarella, green salad, and olives. The target food to estimate is mozzarella. The mozzarella portion is a single round piece on the plate, approximately 8-9 cm in diameter and about 1.5-2 cm thick, visible by its volume and moisture. Comparing it to the plate size and olives nearby for scale, it appears to be a small to medium portion typical in Swiss servings. Mozzarella has a dense, moist texture but is less heavy than firm cheeses. A mozzarella ball of this visible size typically weighs between 90 and 120 grams. Given the portion looks compact and not overly large, I estimate the mozzarella weight to be about 100 grams."

The image shows a whole pizza cut into 8 slices with visible toppings including pepperoni slices, black olives, cheese, and tomato sauce. The pizza is on a standard-sized pizza box with a corrugated paper base, which helps estimate its diameter to be around 28-30 cm, a typical medium Swiss pizza size. The crust is moderately thick with some charring, and the cheese layer looks evenly spread but not overly thick. Pepperoni slices and olives are dense ingredients adding weight, and there are roughly 20 pepperoni slices and about 13 olives scattered evenly. Given a medium pizza in Switzerland commonly weighs between 300-400 grams, and considering the visible thickness and topping density, this pizza likely weighs around the middle to upper end of this range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the whole pizza to be approximately 370 grams."

The image shows a small hand holding a piece of pain aux fruits secs (dried fruit bread). The bread is round, slightly irregular, and clearly visible with dried fruit pieces embedded in it. Comparing the bread to the fingers provides a good scale: its diameter is roughly the size of the width of three fingers, approximately 7-8 cm across. The bread appears dense and compact with visible dried fruits inside, suggesting moderate density typical of dense bread enriched with fruits. The thickness from visual cues is about 3-4 cm. A similar-sized bread typically weighs between 80 to 120 grams, depending on density and moisture. Considering the Swiss portion context and size relative to the hand, I estimate this portion to be medium-sized, closer to 90 grams rather than maximum size. Therefore, the best estimate for the weight of this pain aux fruits secs is approximately 90 grams."

The image shows a small bowl containing a white creamy substance, which is the 'yaourt nature', partially covered by a significant amount of 'muesli nature'. The yogurt portion is distinct from the muesli by texture and color, occupying roughly half of the bowl's visible inner space, mostly underneath the muesli. Typical Swiss individual yogurt servings are around 100 to 125 grams, especially when served in a small bowl as shown. The yogurt appears to be enough to cover the base of the bowl to a moderate depth, roughly about 2-3 cm thick given the bowl size relative to the granola clusters. Considering the density of plain yogurt and the fact that it fills the bowl bottom with moderate depth despite muesli coverage, I estimate the volume corresponds to a medium portion of about 110 grams."

The muesli consists of clusters and loose pieces spread across about half the surface of the bowl, slightly heaped. The bowl appears to be medium-sized, similar to a typical cereal bowl, with a diameter likely around 12-14 cm. The muesli layer is uneven but appears roughly 2-3 cm thick on average. Considering muesli is relatively light and porous, with a density around 0.3 to 0.4 g/cm³, and the visible volume approximates to roughly 100 to 120 cm³, the weight of the muesli is likely around 30 to 40 grams. Given a medium portion typical in Swiss servings, I estimate about 35 grams for the muesli nature."

The image shows a white plate containing white asparagus ('asperges') accompanied by a dollop of mayonnaise, but only the asparagus weight should be estimated. I count 9 pieces of white asparagus, each roughly cut to about 7-9 cm in length. These pieces are thick and dense, typical of cooked white asparagus, with a diameter around 2.5-3 cm. Asparagus is dense and moist, so each piece likely weighs between 15 to 20 grams. Multiplying an average 17 grams by 9 pieces yields approximately 153 grams. Considering possible moisture content and small size variation, a final estimate around 150 grams is reasonable for this portion."

The target food item is 'mayonnaise thomy,' which is located in the top left corner of the plate, appearing as a small dollop of creamy white sauce. Comparing it to the white asparagus spears beside it, which are roughly 10-12 cm long and about 2-3 cm in diameter, the mayonnaise portion occupies a much smaller volume. Given the plate size and the mayonnaise's height and width, the mayonnaise portion appears to be approximately 1 tablespoon in volume, which usually weighs between 14-15 grams. Considering the Swiss portion context where mayonnaise servings tend to be modest, I estimate the mayonnaise thomy portion to be about 15 grams."

There are exactly three large pieces of beef visible, each about 3-4 cm in width and length, and approximately 2-3 cm thick based on comparison with the bread slice and penne pasta nearby. Given that beef is dense and the chunks appear well-cooked, each piece likely weighs around 40-50 grams. Multiplying by three yields between 120 and 150 grams. Considering medium portion size and some moisture loss in cooking, I estimate the 'brochette de boeuf' weighs about 135 grams."

The target food item is 'mergez,' which is the sausage located at the bottom of the plate. Step 1: Visual identification shows one whole mergez sausage on the plate, distinct in shape and size. Step 2: Dimension analysis reveals the mergez is about 12-14 cm long and roughly 2.5 cm in diameter, based on comparison to the bread piece and the skewer length. Step 3: Considering density, mergez is a dense, cooked sausage, so it appears smaller than its actual weight. Step 4: Portion size calibration: a typical Swiss portion of mergez sausage is around 80-120 grams. Given the size and thickness, it appears to be a medium portion close to standard serving size. Step 5: Cross-validation shows no parts missing, and the sausage is fully visible and cooked. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'mergez' to be approximately 95 grams."

The sauce andalouse is visible on the plate as a dollop of creamy orange sauce beside the bread and brochette. It appears to be a single serving portion typical for a dipping sauce, roughly equivalent to about 1.5 tablespoons. Given that sauces generally have a density close to water but slightly heavier due to fats and ingredients, a tablespoon of sauce usually weighs about 15 grams. Therefore, 1.5 tablespoons would be approximately 22 to 23 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes tend to be slightly smaller, I estimate the weight of the sauce andalouse to be about 20 grams."

The image shows a white plate with a piece of 'pain' (bread) located centrally between the 'brochette de boeuf' and the 'sauce andalouse'. The bread piece appears to be a typical small crusty baguette piece, about 8cm in length and around 4-5cm in width. Its depth is apparent from the visible cross-section, indicating a standard airy but dense crumb structure typical of French bread. Given the size and density, and considering Swiss portion sizes are generally smaller than US, this piece of bread fits the description of a small serving. A portion of this size generally weighs between 40 to 60 grams. I estimate this piece to be about 50 grams, balancing the visible volume and density."

The image shows a white plate with a portion of penne pasta salad ('salade de pâtes') on the left side. The salad consists of penne pasta mixed with small pieces of vegetables and possibly ham. Visually, the portion covers about one-fifth of the plate's surface. The pasta pieces are cooked but not overly dense, mixed with light ingredients, so the overall density is moderate. Comparing the salad portion to the bread slice nearby (which is about 30g), the pasta salad is roughly twice the volume of the slice of bread but mixed with lighter ingredients. Given typical Swiss portion sizes and the moderate density of cooked pasta salad with vegetables, the expected weight range is between 100 and 140 grams. Considering the depth and slight piling of the pasta and ingredients, I estimate a medium portion around 125 grams for the pasta salad."

The target food item is quinoa, which is visibly occupying about half of the bowl. The bowl is a standard medium-sized kitchen bowl, and the quinoa is cooked, making it denser and more compact. The quinoa covers a base layer and some volume is visible, but it doesn't fill the bowl deeply compared to the asparagus and salmon. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes, a medium portion of cooked quinoa would be between 100 and 150 grams. Given the quinoa layer's spread and depth visually, I estimate the quinoa portion here as medium-sized and weigh about 130 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing cooked quinoa, green asparagus spears, and a piece of cooked salmon. Focusing only on the salmon, it is one piece, centrally placed, approximately 8 cm long, 4-5 cm wide, and about 2 cm thick. The salmon is cooked, and cooked salmon typically has a density around 1 g/cm^3. Estimating the volume roughly as a rectangular block: 8 cm x 4.5 cm x 2 cm = 72 cm^3, which translates to about 70-75 grams. Given that the piece is not perfectly rectangular and might have some irregular thickness, and considering typical portion sizes in a Swiss context (usually smaller), I estimate the salmon piece to be at medium to small portion size within this range. Thus, I estimate the cooked salmon weight to be approximately 70 grams."

First, I locate the asparagus ('asperges') in the image; there are multiple pieces spread across the right half of the bowl. By counting, I see about 10 distinct asparagus pieces, varying in thickness and length. Each piece is about 8-10 cm long, and thickness seems typical for cooked green asparagus, roughly 1.5-2 cm diameter. Examining the depth, the asparagus seem to be stacked about two layers deep, indicating some hidden volume beneath the visible pieces. Considering the density of cooked asparagus, which is denser than raw but still retains some lightness, a medium portion thickness of around 2 cm per piece with 10 pieces suggests a significant weight. Typical cooked asparagus weighs about 20 grams per spear on average; however, these lack tips on some pieces and the overall portion looks moderate. Given the Swiss portion sizes tending to be smaller, I estimate the asparagus weight to be around 160 grams accounting for partial pieces and hidden volume under the quinoa. This estimate avoids overcounting by considering variability in piece size and density."

The image shows a McFlurry ice cream in its branded cup, held in one hand. The McFlurry is a soft serve vanilla ice cream mixed with chopped candy pieces visible on top, typical of this dessert. The cup is a paper container roughly sized for a single serving, about 250-300 ml in volume. Soft serve ice cream density is close to 0.55-0.6 g/ml, so estimating by volume, the total ice cream content inside is about 140-180 grams. Taking into account the mix-ins (candies contributing slightly higher density) and the Swiss portion context (generally smaller than US), the weight is likely on the lower end of typical serving sizes. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the McFlurry (without container) to be approximately 160 grams."

Comparing the apple to the bowl handle and the wooden table surface, the apple's diameter looks close to 7-8 cm, typical of a medium apple. The apple's density includes its skin; apples average around 0.8 g/cm3 in density. Medium apples usually weigh between 130-180 grams depending on size and variety. This apple does not appear unusually small or large, so estimating a medium apple weight around the middle of this range is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the apple to be approximately 160 grams."

Visually, the bowl size is roughly comparable to the size of the nearby apple, which is a typical small-to-medium apple, about 7-8 cm in diameter. The muesli fills about half of the bowl's depth with loose clusters. Considering that dry muesli is relatively light but compact in clusters, and the bowl size is medium-small, the volume of muesli shown is approximately 150-180 ml. With muesli density around 0.4-0.5 g/ml, this suggests a weight range of about 60-90 grams. Being conservative and realistic for a single serving with visible clusters, a medium portion weight near the middle of this range is appropriate. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'muesli nature' portion in the image to be approximately 75 grams."

First, visually identify the slice: it is a triangular piece, about the size of a typical small dessert slice. The width appears to be around 7-8 cm at the widest point, the length around 12-13 cm, and the thickness about 2-3 cm. The cake appears dense due to ground almonds and sugar, with a compact texture. Given its dense nut content, the piece will be heavier than a sponge cake of similar size. Considering the dimensions and density, a slice of this size in Swiss portion context would reasonably weigh between 80 and 110 grams. Since the slice is moderate in thickness and does not appear overly large, I estimate approximately 95 grams for this slice of gâteau aux amandes."

Its diameter is roughly 25-28 cm based on common pizza box sizes. The pizza has a medium-thick crust and is topped with cheese, olives, roasted peppers, onions, and some meat slices. Given the toppings, it's denser than a plain cheese pizza. A pizza of this size and topping density typically weighs between 320 and 450 grams in Swiss portion context, which tends to have slightly smaller portions than the US. The pizza is whole and visually complete, with no pieces missing. Estimating towards a medium portion weight, I place the weight around 380 grams. The 'piment' is a single whole chili pepper on the side and is excluded as per instructions."
m4egh2,salade verte,15.0,35.0,20.0,21.02678571428571,0.007397908857762872,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/40709ed3-1ed0-49ed-89e9-67c7e3184f7f,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is ""salade verte"" (green salad). In the image, the salade verte appears as iceberg or similar lettuce leaves placed inside two baguette sandwiches along with chicken and sauce. The visible amount inside each sandwich is a few layers of crisp lettuce leaves, not densely packed, roughly covering the inner bottom side of the baguette. Considering the size of the baguette pieces (around 15 cm long each) and the relative space the salad takes, I estimate about 15-20 grams of lettuce per sandwich. Summing for both sandwiches, the total salade verte weight visually is about 30-40 grams. Given Swiss portions tend to be smaller and the lettuce is light and non-dense, the estimate leans toward the lower side. Therefore, I estimate the total salade verte weight shown to be approximately 35 grams."
m4egh2,poulet,79.0,100.0,21.0,21.02678571428571,0.04091043598342868,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/40709ed3-1ed0-49ed-89e9-67c7e3184f7f,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two sandwiches on a plate, each containing a piece of cooked chicken ('poulet'). Both chicken pieces are skinless, grilled, and appear fairly thin but cover most of the length of each small baguette. The baguette length suggests each chicken piece is about 12-15 cm long and around 3-4 cm wide, with an estimated thickness of about 1 cm. Considering the density of cooked chicken breast, which is fairly dense, each piece weighs approximately 100 grams. Since there are two pieces of chicken visible, but the question asks for the weight of 'poulet' which here likely refers to one piece (per the input prompt), I estimate the weight of one piece of chicken to be about 100 grams. This matches a medium portion size in a Swiss context where portions tend to be moderate."
m4egh2,sauce curry avec mayonnaise,18.0,40.0,22.0,21.02678571428571,0.00976523969224699,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/40709ed3-1ed0-49ed-89e9-67c7e3184f7f,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'sauce curry avec mayonnaise.' In the image, there are two sandwiches on a plate; both contain visible grilled chicken slices, lettuce, and a yellow sauce spread inside the baguettes, which is the curry mayonnaise sauce. Visually, the sauce is spread thinly but covers most of the inner side of the baguette bread, likely around 1 to 2 tablespoons (15-30 ml) per sandwich given the typical spread thickness and surface area. Curry mayonnaise has a density similar to mayonnaise, approximately 0.9 g/ml, so 15-30 ml corresponds to about 13-27 grams per sandwich. Since two sandwiches are present, the combined weight of the sauce would roughly be between 26 and 54 grams if counting both, but only one portion should be estimated unless specified otherwise. Assuming the target is the combined visible amount on the plate (both sandwiches), the weight should be near 40 grams as a medium estimate. This excludes the chicken and lettuce weights and does not include the bread. Therefore, my estimation for 'sauce curry avec mayonnaise' on the two sandwiches is approximately 40 grams."
2ahgvr,chou romanesco,74.0,170.0,96.0,20.716707021791766,0.17518248175182483,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/5540e99f-84bd-4971-a7b2-caab6b4282bb,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The chou romanesco is located at the top right section of the plate. It appears as multiple small florets of roughly 3-4 cm each, typical for a cooked portion of this vegetable. There are approximately 8-10 florets, some partially hidden under other items, so I estimate the total volume to correspond to about 150-200 grams of cooked romanesco. Considering the compactness and density of cooked cruciferous vegetables, and accounting for some weight loss due to cooking, this portion size on a Swiss plate is medium. I therefore estimate the weight of the chou romanesco to be approximately 170 grams."
2ahgvr,steak végétarien et sauce aux oignons,153.0,150.0,3.0,20.716707021791766,0.011318800552377195,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/5540e99f-84bd-4971-a7b2-caab6b4282bb,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'steak végétarien et sauce aux oignons.' In the image, this item is the round, dark red patty positioned centrally on the plate, topped with a brownish sauce containing visible bits, presumably onions. The patty size is roughly the size of a medium palm, around 10 cm in diameter and about 1.5 cm thick. Given it is a vegetarian steak, likely made from vegetables or legumes, its density should be moderate but somewhat denser than pure vegetables. The sauce adds some extra weight but is mostly spread thin. Estimating the patty volume as roughly 10 cm diameter × 1.5 cm thickness gives an approximate volume of about 120 cm³. Given an estimated density near 1 g/cm³ (typical for cooked plant-based patties with moisture), the steak itself could weigh about 120g. The onion sauce appears to be about 2-3 tablespoons (30-45g), but since the instruction is to estimate only the steak with sauce, both together are combined. Adding the sauce weight, the total estimate is about 150g. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes and visual thickness, this is a medium portion. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the steak végétarien et sauce aux oignons to be approximately 150 grams."
2ahgvr,parmesan,,13.0,,20.716707021791766,,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/5540e99f-84bd-4971-a7b2-caab6b4282bb,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate containing several food items including pennine pasta, a vegetarian steak topped with onion sauce, gratin of Swiss chard (côtes de bettes), Romanesco broccoli, and a notable quantity of grated Parmesan sprinkled across the entire plate and on top of the steak. The Parmesan appears finely grated and generously spread, visible as a light white dusting over the steak, pasta, and some of the other food. Considering the distribution and density typical for grated Parmesan, it looks like roughly 2-3 tablespoons of cheese. One tablespoon of grated Parmesan cheese typically weighs about 5 grams. Given the generous coverage but not a thick layer, I estimate a total Parmesan weight of around 12 to 15 grams. Choosing a value in the middle to be conservative and accurate for a Swiss portion size, the best estimate is approximately 13 grams."

The target food item is 'gratin de côtes de bettes'. On the plate it appears as the cooked leafy portion with a browned cheese crust on the right side of the plate. It occupies a roughly oval area approximately 7 cm by 5 cm, and has some thickness, around 2.5 cm estimated from the visible volume and comparison with the knife to the right. Given it is a gratin (a baked vegetable dish with cheese and cream), it will be relatively dense but also contain some creamy and vegetable volume, so density is moderate to high. Considering the Swiss portion sizes which tend to be smaller than US, and visual volume, I estimate the volume as approximately 65-85 grams. Medium density vegetable gratin dishes like this usually weigh around 1.3-1.5 grams per cubic centimeter. Multiplying volume and density, the gratin weighs approximately 79 grams. Hence, I estimate the 'gratin de côtes de bettes' portion to be around 80 grams."

The target food item is 'pâtes' (pasta), which is located on the left side of the plate under the steak végétarien and surrounding some of the other foods. Visually, the pasta consists of penne cooked and lightly covered with grated parmesan. The portion seems to be a moderate serving, covering roughly one quarter of a standard dinner plate, with some partially covered by other items. The pasta pieces are mostly whole and layered to some extent, giving a little depth. Considering penne pasta density after cooking is fairly compact and dense, a typical serving in Switzerland would be slightly smaller than US portions, suggesting a medium portion. Given the area covered, depth estimation, and density, I estimate the portion weight in the range of 100 to 130 grams. Choosing the middle value close to 115 grams as a reasonable estimate for this pasta serving."

The target food item is 'pain tartiné au pesto'. The image shows three small toasted bread slices each topped with a visible layer of green pesto spread. Each toasted slice is roughly 5cm in diameter and about 1cm thick. The pesto layer appears moderately thick, about 3-4mm. Considering Swiss portion sizes, small canapé-style toasted bread slices usually weigh around 10-12 grams each without spread. Adding pesto, which is dense due to nuts and oil, adds approximately 3-4 grams per slice. Therefore, each slice with pesto likely weighs around 14-16 grams. Since there are three slices, the total weight should be about 42-48 grams. To be conservative and grounded visually, I estimate the total weight of 'pain tartiné au pesto' to be approximately 45 grams."

The target food item is 'tomates cerises' (cherry tomatoes). First, I locate them on the plate: there are 11 whole cherry tomatoes visible, arranged in a small cluster. Each cherry tomato is roughly spherical, about 2.5 to 3 cm in diameter, which is typical for cherry tomatoes. Compared to the plate (standard small plate around 20 cm diameter) and the slices of bread with pesto, the size and count are reliable. Cherry tomatoes have a density close to water due to their high water content, with approximate weight per tomato around 15 to 20 grams for a medium cherry tomato. Considering Swiss portion sizes tend to be smaller, I estimate each tomato weighs about 15 grams. Multiplying 11 tomatoes by 15 grams gives a total estimated weight of around 165 grams. This accounts for some variation in size and firmness but is a reasonable weight estimation based on the visual evidence."

The target food is 'chocolat noir aux amandes'. In the image, this item is a dark chocolate bar with visible pieces of almonds embedded on the surface. The chocolate piece is rectangular, approximately the size of a small hand palm. Comparing to the brioche next to it, which is approximately the size of a small bread roll (roughly 7-8 cm diameter), the chocolate piece is about 8 cm long, 4 cm wide, and roughly 0.7 cm thick. Dark chocolate with almonds is dense, and the nuts add some volume but also more weight. A typical density for dark chocolate is about 1.3 g/cm3, accounting for air gaps around the almonds the effective density might be slightly less but still close to 1.2-1.3 g/cm3. The volume estimate is length × width × thickness = 8 × 4 × 0.7 = 22.4 cm3. Multiplying by density (approx. 1.25 g/cm3) gives about 28 grams. Considering the visible size and density, and that this is a moderate portion size, I estimate the weight of the 'chocolat noir aux amandes' to be approximately 28 grams."

The target food item is 'brioche au chocolat'. In the image, there is a single small round brioche which appears to be slightly larger than a golf ball but smaller than a typical bread roll seen in US portions, consistent with Swiss smaller portions. The brioche looks dense but light, with a golden-brown crust and a fluffy texture underneath, typical of brioche. The size can be approximated using the chocolate bar pieces next to it as reference; the brioche is roughly 7-8 cm in diameter and about 3-4 cm thick. Considering Swiss portion sizes and the typical density of brioche, a single small brioche au chocolat of this size generally weighs between 60 and 80 grams. Given its visible density and size, a medium estimate around 70 grams is appropriate."

The image shows a single tartine covered with Nutella placed on a white plate. The tartine slice appears to be a small to medium piece of bread, roughly half the size of a standard slice of sliced bread, and relatively thin. A typical small slice of bread weighs about 20 grams. The Nutella spread is applied evenly but not thickly on top, estimating about 10 grams of Nutella based on typical portioning and coverage. Bread is dense but light compared to Nutella which is denser. Combining the bread and Nutella layers, the total estimated weight of the tartine Nutela is about 30 grams."

The image shows a small white plate with a decorative red and green border, holding three small triangular pieces of gruyère cheese. Each piece appears to be about 2-3 cm in length, roughly 2 cm wide at the base, and about 0.7-1 cm thick. Gruyère is a dense, firm cheese, so the weight per volume is relatively high. Estimating the total volume of the three pieces combined, and considering their density, I would approximate each piece to weigh around 8-10 grams. Three pieces combined would therefore weigh about 24-30 grams. Given the visual size and Swiss portion norms, I estimate the weight of the gruyère on the plate to be about 27 grams."

The image shows a plate containing various foods, including the 'brioche au chocolat' at the top of the plate. The brioche is a single round bun with chocolate pieces embedded in the dough. It is roughly the size of a small bread roll, comparable in size to the other small bread item (pain aux noix) on the plate but slightly larger. Using the fork for scale, the brioche measures approximately 7-8 cm in diameter and is moderately thick, indicating a fairly light but dense bread structure with chocolate inclusions. Typical Swiss portion sizes for such a brioche are smaller than in the US, usually around 60-80 grams. Considering the size, visual density, and chocolate content, the brioche au chocolat likely weighs close to 70 grams, which I estimate as a medium portion size for this item."

The target food item is 'cottage cheese aux herbes,' which is visible near the bottom center of the plate as a small pile of white curds flecked with herbs. Visually, it covers an area roughly 4 cm wide and is about 1-1.5 cm deep, corresponding to a modest serving size. Cottage cheese is a low-density fresh cheese with considerable moisture content. Given the size and typical density of cottage cheese, this portion looks to be between 80 to 110 grams. The plate and surrounding items (egg, strawberries, bread rolls) provide scale, confirming this is a small to medium portion typical for Swiss breakfast-sized servings. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the cottage cheese aux herbes to be approximately 95 grams."

The pain aux noix is the darker round bread roll to the right of the plate, smaller than the light brioche roll next to it. Visually, it is a small whole round roll approximately 6-7 cm in diameter and looks fairly dense, with visible pieces of walnuts. Compared to the brioche roll and considering Swiss portions which tend to be smaller than US portions, this small whole grain walnut bread piece would weigh around 50-60 grams. Factoring in walnut density and bread density, and the roll size, I estimate this to be a medium small to medium portion, so approximately 55 grams."

The target food item is 'tomates rôties' which are the small roasted tomatoes visible near the center of the plate. I count 11 whole grape or cherry tomatoes, all intact and closely packed together. These tomatoes appear slightly wrinkled and soft, consistent with roasting, which reduces water content and slightly decreases volume but increases density. Each roasted grape tomato typically weighs between 10 and 15 grams in a Swiss portion context. Considering 11 tomatoes at roughly 12 grams each (middle range), this gives about 132 grams total. Given the plate and portion size, this seems a medium portion, so I will lean towards the middle of the range. There are no hidden tomatoes, and the volume and density align with a total estimate in the range of 120-140 grams. Therefore, I estimate the roasted tomatoes to weigh approximately 130 grams."

The image shows 7 whole strawberries and 1 half strawberry placed on a white plate. They vary slightly in size but appear medium to small, typical of Swiss portion sizes. Using visual comparison to the other items on the plate such as the tomatoes and the cheese slice, each whole strawberry likely weighs around 12-15 grams. The half strawberry would be about 6-7 grams. Summing the pieces, the total strawberry count is 7.5 in effective whole size. Using an average weight of ~13 grams per whole strawberry, the total weight for the strawberries is roughly 7.5 × 13 = 97.5 grams. Adjusting slightly for visual density and moisture, I estimate the fraises weight to be approximately 95 grams."

The target food item is 'oeuf au plat' (fried egg), located on the right side of the plate. The egg white is fully spread with a visible yolk, seasoned with spices. The size can be compared with the nearby walnut bread roll and small brioche, as well as the fork, which gives context to the plate size. A standard Swiss fried egg from one large egg typically weighs around 50 grams (including cooking moisture loss but considering the egg is whole and well cooked). The egg appears standard in size, not particularly small or large, and fully visible without parts missing. Therefore, a reasonable estimation is about 50 grams for the oeuf au plat."

The image shows a white plate with several food items. The target food item, 'hummous,' is located at the bottom left corner of the plate. It appears as a creamy, slightly textured beige spread or scoop. Comparing the hummous portion to nearby items like the green olives and the dollop of cottage cheese, it appears to be a small to medium serving. Given the Swiss portion context, where servings tend to be smaller than in the US, and considering the approximate volume based on its spread and height (roughly 3-4 cm in diameter with moderate thickness), the hummous is likely about 60 grams in weight, as hummous is dense but slightly airy. This estimation fits well within the visual size and density cues visible on the plate."

The st-félicien is located at the top left part of the plate as a triangular creamy cheese wedge. It appears to be a typical portion size of a soft cheese wedge, around one sixth to one eighth of a small round cheese. Given the visible thickness and density of this cheese, it is denser than typical spreads but softer than hard cheeses. The wedge is about 4 cm wide at the base and 3.5 cm in height with a depth similar to its width, suggesting a volume that corresponds to approximately 40-50 grams typically for this size of soft cheese portion. Considering Swiss portion sizes which tend to be moderate rather than large, and based on the visual comparison to other elements on the plate like strawberries and rolls, I estimate the weight of the st-félicien wedge on this plate to be 45 grams."

The target food is 'tomates', which are located at the top of the plate as five half-slices of fresh tomato. Each tomato slice appears to be medium thickness, roughly 0.5 cm thick, with a diameter typical of a standard tomato slice around 5 cm. Tomatoes are dense with water content but are not very heavy per volume. Considering the size of the plate, which is a standard small plate with about 22 cm diameter, the tomato slices occupy a small segment of the plate. Each half-slice of tomato likely weighs about 15 grams on average, so five half slices would total approximately 75 grams. Given that the tomatoes look fresh, juicy, and not dried out, the estimate should be fairly accurate. Therefore, the estimated weight for the tomatoes here is approximately 75 grams."

The target food item is 'morbier', which is a semi-soft cow's milk cheese recognizable by the thin line of ash running through each slice. The morbier slices occupy about 1/6th of the plate's diameter in width and are about 1 cm thick each. Based on the typical density and thickness of morbier, and the size of the slices relative to the plate (which is a standard small dinner plate of ~22 cm diameter), each slice is roughly 30 grams. Since there are two slices, a total weight estimate is approximately 60 grams. Given the Swiss portion context that tends to be smaller than US portions, and the fact that the slices are not very thick or large, a conservative estimate of 55 grams is reasonable."

The image shows a plate with three different foods: sliced tomatoes, two slices of morbier cheese, and a serving of taboulé. The taboulé is the portion on the left, which is a mix of couscous grains with diced vegetables like bell peppers and parsley. Visually, the taboulé mound is about the same height as the cheese slices and slightly bigger in surface area, roughly about 10 cm in diameter and about 2.5 cm thick on average. Using the plate and tomato slices for scale, this appears to be a small to medium Swiss portion of taboulé. Considering taboulé is not very dense due to the fluffy couscous and vegetable mix, the density is moderate. A typical small-medium portion of couscous taboulé would weigh between 100 and 150 grams. Given the volume and spread visible, I estimate this portion at about 130 grams."

The image shows a small green bowl with three whole strawberries, all with leaves attached. Based on the bowl size relative to the strawberries, which seem quite large and plump, we can estimate each strawberry to weigh around 50-60 grams because typical Swiss strawberries are smaller, and these appear to be a larger variety. The three strawberries together therefore likely weigh between 150 and 180 grams. Considering the density of strawberries, which are mostly water and fairly dense, and the visible volume they occupy in the bowl, I estimate the total weight of these strawberries to be approximately 165 grams."

The image shows one single pear (poire) placed on a wooden surface, fully visible with its stem intact. Comparing the pear to the wood plank texture and assuming standard plank dimensions, this pear is medium-sized, typical of European pears. The shape is standard, and the fruit appears dense and solid with skin included. Generally, medium pears weigh between 150 and 200 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes tend to be smaller, I estimate this pear to be around the mid-range of a medium pear weight at approximately 170 grams."

The image shows two halves of a kiwi fruit, one half is cut cleanly and the other half is partially eaten. Both halves together represent about one whole kiwi, with a typical small to medium size consistent with Swiss fruit portions. Visually, the kiwi appears smaller than large commercial sizes and without the container or skin weight beyond what is visible. The density of kiwi is moderate, juicy but firm flesh. A typical medium kiwi weighs approximately 70 grams whole. Given the partial consumption and the visible volume, the remaining kiwi in the image corresponds roughly to half to slightly more than half of a kiwi, roughly between 30 and 40 grams. To estimate the weight of the entire kiwi fruit from these halves in the picture, it is reasonable to approximate a total weight of 75 grams for one whole kiwi fruit including the skin visible in the halves. Since the target food item is 'kiwi' (including skin), the weight estimate is 75 grams."

The image shows a single whole banana placed on a table next to a laptop keyboard. By comparing the banana's length to the standard width of a laptop keyboard key (approximately 1.5 cm), the banana appears to be around 18-20 cm long. The thickness and curvature are typical for a medium-sized banana. Considering the fruit density and visual size, and knowing Swiss portions are usually slightly smaller than US averages, this banana fits the profile of a medium banana weighing approximately 120 to 140 grams. Given its healthy size and no visible signs of dehydration or over-ripeness, I estimate the weight of this banana to be about 130 grams."

The target food item, 'yaourt nature', is the white creamy base at the bottom of the bowl. It is partially visible under the layer of blueberries, pineapple chunks, and pecan nuts. The container seems to be a small to medium-sized bowl, with the yogurt covering the entire bottom and rising a little up the sides, indicating a solid portion. Comparing the size of the blueberries (about 1.5-2 cm in diameter) and pecan halves (about 3-4 cm each), the depth of the yogurt is roughly 2-3 cm deep. Typically, in Swiss portion context, a yogurt serving in a bowl like this would be around 125-150 grams. Given the visible depth and spread, and accounting for the yogurt density (approx. 1 g/cm3), I estimate this natural yogurt portion weighs approximately 140 grams."

The target food item is 'ananas' (pineapple) visible in a bowl containing yaourt nature, myrtilles, and noix de pécan. Visually, the pineapple is cut into small chunks, scattered mostly centrally on top of the yogurt. I count approximately 7 visible pineapple chunks. Each chunk appears approximately 2-3 cm long, 1.5-2 cm wide with an estimated thickness of around 1.5 cm. Pineapple is a dense fruit but with high water content, so its density is moderate. Each chunk roughly corresponds to about 10-12 grams based on size and density. Multiplying 7 pieces by an average of 11 grams results in about 77 grams. Adjusting slightly for some hidden pineapple beneath the visible surface but limited depth and portion size, I estimate the pineapple weight to be around 75 grams as a reasonable medium portion within the Swiss portion size context."

Each pecan half typically weighs between 2.5 and 3 grams. Visually, these pecans appear to be medium-sized and whole. Multiplying 11 pieces by an average weight of about 2.8 grams per pecan half gives approximately 30.8 grams total. Considering slight size variations and visual confirmation that all pieces are quite intact and there are no hidden additional nuts, the estimated weight range is roughly 28-33 grams. I will choose a value in the middle of this range for a conservative but accurate estimation, which is 31 grams."

The image shows a bowl containing a mixture of yaourt nature (plain yogurt), pineapple chunks, blueberries (myrtilles), and pecan nuts. The target food is 'myrtilles'. I count roughly 25 visible blueberries of varying sizes. Blueberries are fairly dense for their size, and each blueberry weighs approximately 1 to 1.5 grams on average in Swiss portion context. Considering the bowl and visible volume, some blueberries are partially hidden or buried in the yogurt but since the image shows almost all visible blueberries on top, I will estimate around 25 blueberries total. Multiplying the count (25) by an average weight of 1.3 grams gives an estimated weight of about 32.5 grams. Rounded conservatively and accounting for slight overlap and density, the estimate for the total weight of the blueberries is 32 grams."

Its length seems about 15-18 cm, which is typical for a medium banana. The banana is ripe with some brown spots, which does not affect the weight significantly. Standard medium bananas weigh roughly between 100 and 130 grams. Considering this portion size falls comfortably into a medium range (not particularly small or large), I estimate the weight of the banana to be around 120 grams."

The slice is placed on a standard white plate, allowing comparison for size. The bread slice appears to be a petite tartine, roughly the size of the palm of a hand or slightly smaller, estimated around 8 cm in length and 4-5 cm in width. The bread slice likely weighs about 15 grams given the thinness and size typical of Swiss portions. The butter spread looks thin and uneven, approximately 3-4 grams. The chestnut cream appears to cover most of the bread surface with a thin to medium layer, likely about 10 grams, considering its density is similar to a thick jam. Summing up, the total weight of the tartine including bread, butter, and chestnut cream is about 28-30 grams. Given the target food is ""tartine avec crème de marrons et beurre"", which refers to the whole open-faced portion, I estimate the total combined weight to be 29 grams."

The image shows two muffins placed on a white plate, one shaped as a heart and the other round. Both appear to be rhubarb muffins as indicated. The muffins have a golden-brown top with visible chunks of rhubarb. Considering typical muffin size relative to the plate, each muffin is about 7 cm in diameter (or similar length for the heart-shaped one) and roughly 3-4 cm in height. Muffins are moderately dense baked goods with some moisture content from fruit chunks. Given Swiss portion sizes tend to be smaller than US, a regular-sized muffin typically weighs around 90-110 grams. The heart-shaped muffin is slightly smaller and appears a bit denser due to caramelization on edges, estimating about 90 grams. The round muffin looks slightly larger and fluffier, closer to 110 grams. Since the prompt does not specify which muffin to weigh, I assume the average for one muffin around 100 grams. Hence, the estimated weight for one 'muffin à la rhubarbe' based on visible size, density, and typical portion in Switzerland is approximately 100 grams."

The target food item is 'asperge' (asparagus). In the image, there are three asparagus spears placed on a white plate alongside two pieces of corn on the cob and a steak haché. For identification, all three asparagus spears are fully visible and lie flat on the plate with their typical slender size. In terms of size, asparagus spears in Swiss portions are usually thinner and shorter than in US portions, averaging around 12-15 cm in length and around 0.8-1 cm in diameter. Visually comparing the asparagus spears to the corn pieces and the steak haché, these asparagus appear medium-thick and medium-length. Considering the density and moisture content of cooked asparagus, which is dense but lightweight compared to other vegetables, a single medium-sized spear weighs approximately 15-20 grams. Given there are three spears, the total weight range is about 45-60 grams. The portions here look moderate, so I estimate the total asparagus weight to be around the midpoint at 53 grams."

The steak haché is clearly visible on the plate and appears to have a typical thickness of about 1.5-2 cm, with a diameter around 9 cm based on the relative size compared to the corn pieces and asparagus. Ground beef patties like this generally weigh between 100-150 grams for this size in a Swiss portion context, which tends to be slightly smaller than US portions. The visible texture indicates it is cooked and compact but not overly thick or large. Considering these factors, I estimate the steak haché weighs about 130 grams, which is a medium portion for this item."

The target food to estimate is 'maïs', which visually consists of 2 pieces of corn cob roughly cut. Each piece is about 8-10 cm in length and has a diameter consistent with a typical small corn cob segment. The two pieces together fill a moderate portion of the plate, slightly smaller than half a whole corn cob. Corn cob pieces are dense with kernels, and the kernels' weight contributes significantly to the total. A typical medium-sized corn on the cob weighs about 150-200 grams when full. Given these are smaller cut pieces, and the portion is two such segments, I estimate the total weight roughly around 120 to 140 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes tend to be smaller, and some kernel loss due to cooking may reduce weight slightly, I select a medium range estimate of 130 grams."

The sauce aux champignons appears as a creamy mushroom sauce coating the mushrooms and some pasta in a medium-sized bowl. Visually, the sauce is thick and creamy, adhering well to the mushrooms which appear to be cooked and softened. There are 7 visible pieces of cooked mushroom slices coated in the sauce, with additional sauce visible around them. Given the creamy texture and the typical density of such a mushroom cream sauce (crème + garlic + mushrooms), the sauce portion is moderate but not large. Considering Swiss portion context, the sauce likely weighs less than the pasta and vegetables combined, with a thickness that adds volume but moderate weight. Estimating a portion where sauce is mostly coating mushrooms and pasta rather than in excess, a reasonable weight for the sauce is between 80 to 110 grams, with a medium portion estimate around 95 grams. Therefore, the estimated weight of the sauce aux champignons is approximately 95 grams."

The target food is 'courgettes gratinée' visible on the left side of the bowl. There are about 6 visible slices of courgette that appear cooked and gratinated, showing a browned top layer which suggests some added cheese or sauce. Each slice looks about 5-6 cm in diameter and roughly 1-1.5 cm thick. Considering the density of cooked courgettes with gratin (which is moderately dense due to moisture loss but includes cheese/cream), each slice would weigh approximately 20-25 grams. Multiplying by 6 slices gives a range of roughly 120-150 grams. Given the portion looks medium-sized, I estimate the courgettes gratinée weight to be approximately 135 grams."

The target food item is 'pâtes' (pasta), which is clearly visible in the bowl filling roughly two-thirds of the volume. The pasta are wide flat noodles, cooked with cream and mushrooms sauce, and they appear well cooked but not overly compacted. Comparing to the bowl size, which is a small to medium size bowl (Swiss portion context), the pasta layer seems about 3-4 cm deep with some overlapping layers. Cooked pasta is dense and compact, so the weight can be higher than it looks superficially. Estimating the visible volume and density, a typical portion of cooked pasta in this bowl context ranges between 130-180 grams. Given the visual portion size and the sauce integration, the pasta portion is medium-sized, so I select a middle estimate around 155 grams."

The target food item is 'chocolat.' The image shows a small piece of bread and a milk chocolate wafer stick placed next to it on a wooden surface. The chocolate stick is approximately the length of the bread's radius and has a visible thickness and texture typical of coated wafer sticks. Standard milk chocolate wafer sticks weigh around 10 to 15 grams depending on size, and this one looks to be medium-sized, roughly 12-13 cm long and about 1.5 cm thick. Considering typical portion sizes and Swiss context, it is likely a small snack-sized portion. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this chocolate stick to be approximately 13 grams."

Comparing the bread size to the chocolate stick beside it (approximately 10-12 cm long), the bread piece seems about 8-9 cm long, 6-7 cm wide, and around 4-5 cm in thickness. Bread has a moderate density, typically around 250-300 grams per 1000 cm3. Estimating the volume at about 250 cm3, the bread piece would weigh approximately 65-75 grams.

The image shows one pita bread ('pain pita') placed on a white plate with some visible lettuce inside and a bit outside. The pita appears to be a medium-small size typical of Swiss portions, approximately 12-14 cm in diameter and about 2-3 cm thick when considering its pocket volume. Pita bread is relatively dense but lighter than dense breads like rye, with an estimated density around 0.25-0.3 g/cm³. Given the observed size and thickness, the total volume of the pita bread is roughly a flattened sphere or pocket at about 150-180 cm³. Applying the density and the typical weight ranges for Swiss pita bread of this size, the weight estimate lies between 70 and 95 grams.

The target food item is 'jambon' (ham). In the image, the sandwich is made with pita bread, visible lettuce, and the ham is hidden inside but slightly visible through the pita opening. Since the pita is a standard small Swiss portion (about 100g), the filling appears minimal. The ham slices are thinly folded and do not appear bulky; typically, a serving inside a small sandwich like this ranges between 30 to 50 grams. Given the visual evidence of a thin ham layer with some volume but not excessive layering, I estimate the ham weight closer to the lower-middle of this range. Therefore, I estimate the ham weight to be approximately 40 grams."

The target food item is 'moutarde' (mustard). Looking carefully at the image, the mustard is not visibly separate or in a container; it appears to be spread thinly inside the pita sandwich. Mustard is a condiment, usually applied in small amounts; a typical serving size inside such a sandwich is roughly 5-10 grams. Given the modest size of the sandwich and the thin spread visible through the lettuce and pita bread, the mustard portion is likely on the lower side of this range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the mustard to be approximately 6 grams."

The apple is medium-small, typical in Swiss contexts where fruit portions tend to be on the smaller side compared to US standards. The size relative to the fingers suggests a diameter of about 6-7 cm. Judging from the rounded shape and solid density of apples, and knowing a medium-sized apple typically weighs around 150-180 grams, this one appears slightly smaller than the medium size. Therefore, estimating the weight closer to about 130-140 grams is reasonable. Taking all these factors into account, the weight estimate for this apple is 135 grams."

Considering the density of strawberries, which are relatively light but compact, and the fact these pieces include skin, the total weight estimate for 15 pieces falls between 120 and 180 grams. Taking a middle ground considering average piece size and portion density, a reasonable total weight estimation of the strawberries is 150 grams."

The image shows a white square plate with a portion of strawberries ('fraises') and a piece of chocolate cake ('gâteau au chocolat'). The target is the gâteau au chocolat. The cake piece is rectangular and roughly 5 cm in length, 5 cm in width, and about 3.5 to 4 cm in height, based on comparison to the strawberry pieces and the plate size. Chocolate cake is dense but porous, so density can be approximated at about 0.4 to 0.5 grams per cubic centimeter. Calculating the volume as roughly 5 x 5 x 3.8 = 95 cubic centimeters, and using the density midpoint approximately 0.45 g/cm³, results in roughly 42.75 grams. Given it is homemade type cake and knowing Swiss portions tend to be smaller than US ones, rounding to about 45 grams seems reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the gâteau au chocolat weighs approximately 45 grams."

The image shows a rectangular plastic container filled with 'salade grecque.' The salad consists of a mix of diced vegetables like cucumber, tomato, pepper, rings of onion, olives, and cubes of feta cheese, all coated with a visible amount of homemade salad dressing ('sauce à salade maison'). Since the target food item to estimate is 'sauce à salade maison,' I must estimate only the weight of the dressing coating the salad and visible on the container sides. The dressing appears to be an oily vinaigrette, creating a thin but visible glaze over the ingredients as well as some residue along the container’s walls. Considering the container size, the salad fills roughly 2/3 of it; the dressing layers the entire volume but only very thinly. Typically, vinaigrettes weigh less per volume than water due to oil content, and here the visible dressing layer likely represents between 15 to 25 ml, which corresponds roughly to 13-22 grams given the oil-vinegar density mix. Given this is a homemade salad with moderate visible dressing coverage and some pooling, I estimate the weight of the 'sauce à salade maison' to be about 18 grams, a medium portion size for this amount of salad in Swiss context."

The image shows a rectangular plastic container filled with salade grecque, which includes diced cucumbers, yellow and red peppers, onions, olives, and small pieces of feta cheese. The salad fills roughly half to two-thirds of the container's visible height, and the container seems to be about the size of a standard small storage box, approximately 12 cm long, 8 cm wide, and 6 cm deep. The salad is diced finely, suggesting a compact volume with minimal air gaps. Considering the density of the salad ingredients—vegetables and cheese—not being very light but not very dense either, I estimate a density around 0.7 to 0.8 g/cm3. Estimating the salad volume at roughly 400 cm3, multiplying by the density gives a weight range of 280 to 320 grams. Given the portion size appears moderate for Swiss portions but still substantial, I assess the final weight closer to the middle of this range. Therefore, I estimate the salade grecque in the container weighs approximately 300 grams."

The image shows one peeled banana placed on a flat surface. The banana appears to be relatively small in length, roughly about 10-12 cm based on typical surface texture size and common countertop dimensions. Peeled bananas are dense but lighter than the unpeeled equivalent by a small margin due to the peel weight. A typical medium banana weighs around 120-140 grams unpeeled; peeled bananas typically lose around 30-40 grams from peel removal. Given the banana's smaller size than average and that it is peeled, I estimate the weight to be in the range of 70 to 90 grams. This banana leans towards a smaller size, so I select an estimate at the lower-middle end, approximately 80 grams."

The image shows a single peeled banana segment on a dark surface. This piece looks to be roughly half the length of a standard banana, which typically ranges from 15 to 20 cm in total length. Given the visible size compared to the texture of the surface, this segment is around 8 to 9 cm long. Bananas are dense fruits, with an average density near 0.95 g/cm3. A whole medium banana in Swiss portion sizes weighs around 120 to 130 grams. Since this portion is about half a banana both in length and volume, and considering a slight tapering at ends, the weight should be roughly half of a medium banana's weight. This leads to an estimated weight of about 60 to 65 grams for this peeled banana segment."

The apple appears to be medium-sized, roughly fitting in the palm with the fingers wrapped comfortably around it. Typically, a medium apple in Switzerland weighs between 140 and 180 grams. Considering the apple looks firm and dense, with no visible cuts or missing parts, and accounting for the skin weight, I estimate this apple's weight to be towards the middle range. Therefore, the estimated weight of this pomme is approximately 160 grams."

The target food is the 'amandes grillées' (roasted almonds). Visually, there are about 19 individual almonds visible on top of the vegetable mixture and rice noodles. Each almond appears to be medium-sized and roasted, which slightly reduces their water content but not weight significantly. A typical roasted almond weighs about 1.1 grams (weight varies between 1-1.3g). Multiplying 19 almonds by 1.1 grams per almond gives approximately 20.9 grams. The almonds are all fully visible and roughly uniform in size, so no adjustment for hidden pieces or size variation is needed. The portion size fits the Swiss typical accompagnement, thus this estimation is reasonable and accurate. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the roasted almonds to be approximately 21 grams."

The target food item is 'nouilles de riz' (rice noodles) in the image. Visually, the rice noodles occupy the left side of the plate. The portion size appears moderate and is arranged loosely. Using the white plate as a reference, the noodles extend over roughly 1/3 of the plate's surface area, with visible strands about 5-7 mm thick and loosely bunched, showing some depth but not densely packed. Rice noodles are dense and relatively heavy when hydrated and cooked. Given the Swiss portion context (smaller than typical US portions) and the visual appearance, the estimated weight range for this quantity of rice noodles is between 90 and 130 grams. Considering the amount visible and loose piling, the estimate leans towards the middle of this range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'nouilles de riz' to be approximately 110 grams."

The piece is rectangular, roughly about 6 cm in length, 4 cm in width, and about 1.5 cm thick, judging by the texture of the wooden surface and the typical size of turrón pieces. Turrón is quite dense due to the nuts and sugar, so it weighs more than its volume might suggest. Given the size and density, a piece of this volume would typically weigh between 35 and 50 grams. The piece shown is partially eaten but mostly whole; I estimate this piece to be approximately 42 grams considering the visual size and density."

The image shows a white plate with a colorful geometric pattern filled with chips labeled as 'vaya beans.' The chips appear thin and made primarily from beans, which suggests a density similar to other bean-based chips, slightly lighter than traditional corn chips. Visually, the pile covers about half the surface area of a medium-sized plate (approximately 20-22 cm in diameter). The chips are stacked but not densely packed and have uneven thickness but remain generally thin and light. Considering the size of individual chips averaging about 5-7 cm each, and that the pile contains roughly 20-25 chips, the total weight is likely in the range of 40-60 grams, leaning slightly towards the lower-middle because the chips are thin and porous. Balancing visual volume and the typical density of bean chips, the most reasonable estimate is about 50 grams for the chips on the plate."

The piece of bread appears to be roughly 8 cm long and 4 cm wide with an average thickness of about 2 cm, but the chestnut cream is spread thinly on the surface, covering most of the face of the bread without much height. The chestnut cream has a glossy, sticky texture which suggests moderate density but spread thinly, so the volume is relatively low. Given that Swiss portions tend to be smaller, and the spread is moderate, I estimate the total weight of the chestnut cream on this piece to be around 25-30 grams, with a precise estimate near 28 grams."

The image shows a piece of bread ('pain') with a spread of chestnut cream ('crème de marrons') on top. The target food item is 'pain'. First, I identify the bread portion as being about a small torn piece, roughly triangular in shape, with an estimated length of about 8 cm and width around 4 cm at the widest part. The bread is about 2 cm thick on average, typical for a slice of rustic bread. The density of bread is moderate, usually around 250-300 grams per 1000 cm3. Calculating the approximate volume: length 8 cm × width 4 cm × thickness 2 cm = 64 cm3. Using average density of 0.27 g/cm3 (270 g/l), the weight is approximately 17 grams. The crust appears light and the piece is relatively small, confirming a small portion size appropriate for a Swiss context. There is no visible bread underneath the torn piece and no hidden volume, so no adjustment needed. Therefore, the estimated weight of the bread piece is around 17 grams."

The thickness of each piece appears to be around 0.7 cm. Milk chocolate is quite dense, with an average density around 1.3 g/cm³. Calculating the volume for two pieces combined: volume = length × width × thickness × number of pieces = 5 cm × 2.5 cm × 0.7 cm × 2 ≈ 17.5 cm³. Multiplying by density: 17.5 cm³ × 1.3 g/cm³ = approximately 22.75 grams. Considering normal Swiss portion sizes and small margin of error in thickness and size, I estimate the total weight of the two chocolate pieces to be about 23 grams."

Visually, the thickness is moderate, around 1 to 1.5 cm, indicating a standard density cookie – not overly thick or thin. The cookie contains visible chocolate chunks, which add some density to the total weight. Considering typical portions in Switzerland where cookie sizes are slightly smaller than in the US, and comparing to known weights of similar chocolate chip cookies ranging from 30g (small) to 60g (large), this cookie fits into a medium portion. Accounting for depth, visible chocolate density, and typical composition, I estimate the cookie weighs approximately 45 grams."

The image shows a single slice of pizza on a white plate. The slice is triangular with a thin crust that is slightly charred at the edges, typical of a Neapolitan-style pizza. The visible toppings include melted cheese, tomato sauce, some strips of cured meat (possibly salami or pepperoni), and a small piece of basil. The plate appears to be a standard small to medium-sized dessert or salad plate (about 20-22 cm diameter), and the slice covers roughly one-third of the plate surface. The slice's thickness is thin to medium with moderate cheese coverage and a few pieces of meat, not heavily loaded. A typical thin-crust pizza slice of this size and topping density in a Swiss portion context usually weighs around 90 to 130 grams. Considering the thin crust, moderate toppings, and visible size, this slice is closer to a small-to-medium portion, so an estimate around the mid to lower end of that range is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the pizza slice to be approximately 100 grams."

Visually, it appears to be about 10-12 cm long and approximately 2 cm wide, with a dense chocolate coating that adds some weight due to the texture and clustered pieces on the surface. Considering Swiss portion sizes, which tend to be smaller than US portions, and the dense chocolate confectionery density, a typical stick of this type weighs between 30 and 50 grams. Given that this stick is not excessively thick but well coated, it is reasonable to estimate the weight in the middle of that range.

There are exactly 3 gressins visible, all fully exposed and separate. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each breadstick appears thin (about 1-1.5 cm diameter) and long (roughly 15-18 cm) based on typical wooden plank width and texture as comparison. The breadsticks have a cylindrical shape and an even thickness along their length. Step 3: Density Considerations - Gressins are quite dense baked goods but also light given their hollow and crispy nature. Sesame seeds add a small weight but not significant in total. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Standard sesame gressins typically weigh between 8 and 12 grams each depending on thickness and length. Given these look slightly slender but standard length, I estimate about 9 grams per piece. Step 5: Cross-validation - With 3 sticks at approximately 9 grams each, the total weight would be about 27 grams. Since only one target item weight is requested, I provide the weight for a single gressin sésame (the unit piece). Therefore, the estimated weight of one sesame breadstick is 9 grams."

Each egg is approximately half the height of the cup and slightly oval in shape, suggesting a size of about 3-4 cm in length and about 2-3 cm in diameter. Typical small foil-wrapped Easter chocolate eggs of this size usually weigh between 10 and 15 grams each due to their solid or hollow chocolate density. Given that both eggs look similar in size, estimating an average weight of 12 grams per egg is reasonable. There are two eggs visible, so the combined weight is approximately 24 grams. Since the task is to estimate the weight of 'œufs en chocolat' collectively, the total weight is about 24 grams."

The target food item is 'poulet rôti,' which is located on the top left of the plate. It consists of several slices/pieces of roasted chicken meat, including both white meat and some skin. There are about 4 to 5 pieces visible, layered slightly but mostly separate. The pieces are moderately thick, considering the visible depth and volume, approximately 1.5 to 2.5 cm thick each collectively. Comparing the size to the plate dimensions, the total chicken portion appears to be roughly 10 cm by 8 cm in area and about 2 cm thick on average. Roasted chicken is dense, so the volume translates to a substantial weight. Estimating volume roughly as 10 cm x 8 cm x 2 cm = 160 cm³, with roasted chicken density around 1 gram per cm³, gives approximately 160 grams. Considering slight overestimation and possible portion loss from bones not shown, a medium portion estimate is best. Thus, the estimated weight of the poulet rôti is about 150 grams."

The target food item is 'salade de carotte', which is located at the top right of the plate. It consists of shredded carrot piled into a small mound. By comparing the portion size to the slice of poulet rôti and the plate dimensions, the shredded carrots likely occupy a volume equivalent to about a small handful. The carrots appear loosely packed, which aligns with the typical density of grated raw carrot—somewhat light but compact. Estimating the dimensions roughly as 7 cm long, 5 cm wide, and 2.5 cm thick, this gives a volume on the order of 87 cubic centimeters. Since raw grated carrots have a density close to 0.8 g/cm³, the estimated weight falls around 70 grams. This portion size fits within a typical Swiss medium serving for shredded carrot salad. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the salade de carotte to be approximately 70 grams."

Compared to the other portions on this Swiss-sized plate (about 22 cm wide), the celery salad occupies roughly a volume similar to a small fist. Its density is medium, as celery root is fairly dense, but the grated texture and dressing reduce compactness. Visually, I estimate the volume to be approximately 70-90 ml. Given the density of grated celery root salad is roughly 0.8 grams per ml, the total weight would range between 56 and 72 grams. Considering this is a moderate portion size in Swiss context, I select an approximate value around 65 grams for the salade de céleri."

By comparing the size of the potato slices to the chicken piece (a known reference of typical portion size) and the carrot salad, the potato slices appear to be about 6 to 7 slices. Each slice looks roughly 5-6 cm in diameter and about 0.5 cm thick. Potato is dense, and the sauce adds some weight too. Considering this, a standard small-medium portion of potato salad in a Swiss context commonly weighs around 110 to 140 grams.

The image shows two slices of whole wheat toast coated with fromage frais on a white plate. The target food item is 'toast'. Step 1: Visual Identification - There are two slices of toast fully visible. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each slice is typical sandwich bread size, approximately 10 cm x 10 cm, with an estimated thickness of about 1.5 cm. Step 3: Density Considerations - Toasted bread is less dense than fresh bread but still substantial; typical density is about 0.3 g/cm3. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - A single slice of standard whole wheat bread weighs around 30-35 g before toasting; toasting reduces water content but weight remains close. So, each slice likely weighs around 30 g. Two slices combined are about 60 g. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The slices appear moderately thick and are not overly toasted or dried out, so around 30 g per slice is reasonable. In conclusion, the total weight of the two toast slices is approximately 60 grams."
2ahgvr,fromage frais,19.0,48.0,29.0,11.162162162162161,0.013587492602091142,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/feb15752-d5e3-4f73-8eeb-9fb560cc6f6b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'fromage frais' which is the creamy spread applied on the toast slices. Step 1: The image shows two slices of toast with a layer of fromage frais evenly spread on them. Step 2: Each toast slice is about the size of regular sandwich bread, roughly 10x10 cm and about 1.5 cm thick for the bread itself. Step 3: The fromage frais is spread in a thin to medium layer with some patches slightly thicker. It appears to be around 2-3 mm thick on most of the surface. Step 4: Fromage frais is soft and has a density similar to cream cheese, roughly 1 g/cm3. For each slice, the fromage frais layer covers approximately 100 cm2 area x 0.25 cm thickness = 25 cm3 = 25 grams approximately. Step 5: Since there are two slices, multiply by 2 for a total of about 50 grams. Step 6: Given slight irregularities and some thinner spread near edges, a conservative estimate is roughly 45-50 grams total of fromage frais on the two toasts. Step 7: Considering Swiss portion size norms, this amount aligns well with a modest spread portion. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of fromage frais in the image to be 48 grams."

The image shows a white cup containing bircher muesli, which is a mixture of soaked oats, yogurt or milk, and soft fruit pieces such as strawberries and perhaps other berries. The quantity in the cup fills approximately half to two-thirds of a standard-sized coffee mug, roughly 200 ml in volume if filled completely, so the visible quantity is about 100-130 ml. Bircher muesli has a relatively dense, moist consistency due to the soaked oats and creamy base, making its density higher than plain fruits or vegetables but lower than solid dense foods. Considering the visible volume and accounting for factors such as air spaces and the moisture content, I estimate the weight is roughly 110 to 140 grams. Given the portion appears standard but not full to the brim, I place the estimate toward the middle of this range at approximately 125 grams."

The image shows a single whole red apple (pomme) placed on a wooden surface. The apple appears to be of small to medium size, typical for Swiss portions which tend to be smaller than US-sized fruits. Considering the apple's visible dimensions — roughly fitting in the palm of a hand — and noting the stem size and curvature, it is likely around 6-7 cm in diameter. Apples generally have a density close to water, making weight estimation directly proportional to volume. A small to medium apple in Switzerland typically weighs between 120-160 grams. Given the apple's compact, round shape and no visible signs of being unusually large or small, I estimate the apple weighs around 140 grams."

The target food item is 'purée d'amande,' which is the almond puree visible as a small dollop on the side of the porridge in the bowl. First, the bowl is relatively small and the almond puree occupies a small area on one side of the container. It appears to be a thick paste, with visible height and volume comparable to about one tablespoon. Typically, a tablespoon of almond puree weighs around 15-20 grams. Considering the visual size of the dollop compared to the bowl and the porridge, it looks closer to about 1 tablespoon, so the likely weight would be near the lower-middle of that range. The density of almond puree is thick and dense, so it contributes significantly to the weight at that volume. Therefore, I estimate the purée d'amande portion to be approximately 17 grams."

The image shows a single chocolate bar held by hand, partially unwrapped. It is a 'branche de chocolat' which is typically a small chocolate stick covered with nuts or crisped bits. Visually, the bar appears to be about 8-10 cm in length and roughly 2-3 cm in width and thickness combined, consistent with small single-serving chocolate sticks in Swiss contexts. Considering the density of chocolate and embedded nuts, the weight is likely around 30-40 grams. The portion size looks medium, not particularly thick or thin. Thus, estimating conservatively and visually, the weight of the branche de chocolat is approximately 35 grams."

The image shows a small shot glass held by a hand, filled nearly to the brim with hydromel (mead). Step 1: The target food item is hydromel, a liquid inside a shot glass. Step 2: Using the hand and fingers as a reference, a standard shot glass typically holds about 30 ml. The glass here appears to be standard-sized or slightly smaller, but not by much. Step 3: Considering the density of hydromel is close to that of water (approximately 1 g/ml), the weight in grams roughly equals the volume in milliliters. Step 4: The hydromel volume appears to be filled almost to the top, so approximately 30 ml. Step 5: Since this is a small portion, and there's no visible spillage or empty space, the weight estimate is close to 30 grams. Therefore, based on visual evidence and standard portion sizes, I estimate the hydromel in this glass weighs about 30 grams."

The image shows a standard-sized single-serving plastic container of natural yogurt ('yaourt nature'), which is common in Swiss and European markets. Such containers typically have a volume of about 125 grams of yogurt. The yogurt appears to be mostly full, with only a small amount missing along the edge, so the remaining yogurt is close to the full portion. Considering the smooth, creamy texture and the known density of natural yogurt (approximately 1 g/cm³), the weight should closely match the volume. Therefore, the estimated weight of the natural yogurt visible in the container is about 120 grams."

The target food item is 'asperges' (asparagus). In the image, two whole asparagus stalks are visible on the left side of the plate. Each stalk appears fresh-cooked and has a typical diameter of about 1.5 to 2 cm with a length of about 12-15 cm visible. Considering these are medium-sized asparagus stalks and appear fully intact, the weight per stalk is roughly 25-35 grams, based on common Swiss portion sizes and asparagus density, which is quite light because asparagus is mostly water. Two stalks together would be about 50-70 grams. Given the visual size and the leverage for smaller Swiss portions, I estimate the total weight of the two asparagus stalks to be approximately 60 grams."

In the image, the fenouil (fennel) appears as a cooked, chopped portion placed adjacent to the other foods on the plate. Visually, it occupies a compact mound roughly 5 cm wide and 3 cm deep, with a slight height due to the chopped layering, suggesting a volume roughly equivalent to a small side portion. The texture looks soft and cooked, which keeps the density relatively intact but reduces volume compared to raw fennel. The fennel pieces are well mixed and not spread thin. Comparing the fenouil to the asparagus spears and rice on the plate (standard-sized plate and fork present as reference), the fenouil portion is moderate, not overly large. Considering fennel's density (similar to a cooked vegetable, approximately 0.7-0.8 g/cm3) and the visible size, the weight is likely in the range of 80-110 grams. Given the conservative Swiss portion size, I estimate the fenouil weight to be around 95 grams."

The target food is 'viande de porc avec sauce aux champignon'. Visually, it is located in the center-left part of the plate, adjacent to the fennel and rice. The pork pieces are sliced thinly and mixed with a creamy mushroom sauce that adds volume but little weight compared to the meat. The portion appears to cover an area about the size of a palm, roughly 8x6 cm, and with an estimated depth/thickness of about 1.5 cm, considering the sauce and meat layers. Cooked pork is dense and combined with sauce, the overall density suggests the volume-to-weight ratio is close to 1:1 (about 1g/cm3). Estimating the volume as approximately 8x6x1.5 = 72 cm3, the weight is about 70-75 grams. Given the serving size and typical Swiss portion context, this aligns with a moderate meat serving. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'viande de porc avec sauce aux champignon' to be around 72 grams."

The target food item is 'riz' (rice). On the plate, the rice portion is to the right side, appearing as cooked mixed rice with some visible pieces of vegetables such as carrots and possibly wild rice mixed in. The rice occupies roughly a quarter of the plate's surface area. Considering a standard Swiss portion size on a medium plate, cooked rice typically weighs around 130-180 grams for a full serving portion. Visually, this portion looks medium-sized, not heaping but a solid serving, and somewhat dense given the cooked state and visible volume. The depth is moderate and the rice is compact. Therefore, I estimate the rice to weigh approximately 150 grams. This estimate avoids overestimation by considering the controlled portion size and the visual clues of volume and density."

The image shows three slices of multigrain bread with visible butter and a layer of strawberry jam ('confiture fraise') spread unevenly on top. The target food item is the strawberry jam only. Each slice has an estimated jam coverage of about 1 to 1.5 tablespoons, with some areas thicker due to visible chunks of fruit. Considering the plate and knife for scale, and knowing Swiss portion sizes tend to be modest, the total amount of jam on the three slices can be estimated by volume. One tablespoon of strawberry jam weighs approximately 20 grams. Each slice seems to have about 1 to 1.5 tablespoons, so the total jam weight ranges from 60 to 90 grams. Taking a cautious estimate closer to 75 grams accounts for the spread thickness and total volume visible, without overestimating. Butter and bread weight are excluded as per instructions."

The image shows three slices of multigrain bread with visible spreadings of butter and strawberry jam on each slice. The target food item is 'beurre' (butter). Visually, the butter is spread thinly and unevenly over the bread slices rather than in thick pats. Each slice appears to have roughly 3 to 5 grams of butter based on the thin layer covering about a third to half of the surface. Since there are three slices, the total butter amount is about 9-15 grams. Considering Swiss portion context and the thin spread, I estimate the total butter amount to be around 12 grams, as a medium spread typical for a breakfast toast."

The image shows three slices of brown bread (pain) on a plate. Each slice appears to be of medium thickness, typical of sliced artisanal or whole grain bread. Compared to the plate and the butter knife on the side, the slices are relatively small, consistent with Swiss portion sizes which tend to be smaller than US portions. Each slice of bread looks around 10 cm by 8 cm with a visible thickness of about 1.2 cm. Considering the density of whole grain bread, which is moderately dense but not very heavy, an average slice of this size weighs approximately 40 grams. There are three separate slices visible, so multiplying, the total weight of the bread (pain) is roughly 120 grams. Since this is just the bread without butter or jam, no additional weight adjustments are necessary. Therefore, the estimated weight of the pain is 120 grams."

The image shows a single apple ('pomme') placed on a wooden table, with no other food items visible for comparison. The apple appears to be of medium size, roughly spherical with a slightly flattened shape, and the stem is intact. Based on the typical size of apples in Switzerland, which are generally smaller than US apples, and the visual size relative to the texture of the wood grain, I estimate the apple's diameter to be around 7-8 cm. Considering the typical density and weight of a medium-sized apple, which includes the skin, the average weight ranges between 120 to 180 grams. Given this apple is not particularly large or small, I assign it to the middle of that range, estimating the weight to be approximately 150 grams."

The Ragusa bar appears to be about the same length as the cup's diameter, roughly 8-9 cm long, about 1.5-2 cm thick and approximately 1.5 cm wide. Ragusa chocolate bars typically contain a filling of gianduja and hazelnuts, making it denser than plain chocolate. Based on the portion size relative to the espresso cup and typical product sizes in Switzerland (smaller than US portions), the estimation for such a single bar would fall between 40 and 50 grams. Considering it is a regular sized bar and not a mini one, I estimate the weight of the Ragusa to be about 45 grams."

The image shows a single standard-sized plastic yogurt container filled almost to the top with plain yogurt ('yaourt nature'). The container is a common type found in Swiss grocery stores, typically around 125 grams net weight for this type of yogurt. The smooth surface and consistency suggest it is not a thick Greek-style yogurt but rather a regular plain yogurt with average density. Visual comparison with the surrounding objects, such as the wooden table and the laptop, confirms this is a small individual portion typical for a single serving. Considering all this, the estimated weight of the 'yaourt nature' is approximately 125 grams."

The image shows a skewer with grilled chicken pieces (poulet) on a plate. There are four distinct chunks of chicken on the skewer, each roughly cubical and about 3 cm in each dimension. Comparing the chicken pieces to the plate and the small amount of rice and pasta visible on the plate, the pieces seem to be of moderate thickness and size typical of a Swiss portion. Chicken breast meat is dense, roughly 1 gram per cubic centimeter, so estimating each piece as about 3x3x3 cm equals approximately 27 grams per chunk. Multiplying by four pieces, the total raw weight would be around 108 grams. Grilling causes a slight water loss, so the cooked weight might be slightly less but the visible amount corresponds roughly to this. Considering this is a usual portion skewered on one stick, I estimate the total weight of the grilled chicken pieces to be about 110 grams, rounded slightly for typical portion size variance."

The yogurt is nearly full, showing a smooth and creamy texture consistent with typical flavored yogurt. The container matches standard Swiss yogurt portion sizes, which are commonly between 125 and 150 grams per serving. Given the visual evidence of the nearly full cup and hand size for scale, I estimate this container holds about 140 grams of yogurt with figs. This is consistent with typical Swiss yogurt packaging and portion control."

It appears to be a standard-sized snack bar, rectangular and roughly 10 cm in length, 3 cm wide, and about 1.5 cm thick. Balisto bars are known to be compact, dense snack bars made from cereals and chocolate chips, so their density is relatively high. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes and the standard weight of Balisto bars which usually range between 25 and 30 grams, this bar looks like an individual portion and matches those known weights. The chocolate chips embedded do not add significant additional weight beyond the bar itself. There are no broken pieces or missing parts, so the full bar is visible. Therefore, based on the visual size, density, and typical packaging data, I estimate the weight of the Balisto bar with chocolate chips to be approximately 28 grams."

The target food item is 'semoule' (couscous). Visually, the semoule is a visible mound occupying roughly one quarter of a standard-sized dinner plate. Comparing it to the fried eggs and the broccoli on the plate provides a size reference. The couscous is loose, with the grains clumped lightly, suggesting it is cooked and fluffy but dense enough to have weight. Typical cooked semoule density and portion sizes in Switzerland are smaller than US portions, and a medium serving is around 120-150 grams. Given the mound size and density visible, I estimate this to be a medium portion closer to 130 grams. There is enough depth and volume, consistent with a serving to accompany eggs and vegetables. Therefore, the estimated weight for the semoule on this plate is 130 grams."

Each egg appears to be a standard size, with yolks that are mostly intact and spread of egg white typical for large eggs cooked in a small amount of oil or butter. Using the plate size (standard dinner plate ~24 cm diameter) for scale, each egg occupies a typical size area consistent with large eggs. A single large egg typically weighs around 50 grams before cooking, and cooking often reduces some water weight but not significantly for fried eggs. So the weight of two œufs au plat together should be approximately 100 grams. Since no additional toppings or significant loss is apparent, I estimate the total weight of the two œufs au plat to be about 100 grams."

The target food item is 'brocoli,' which is located on the right side of the white plate. The broccoli consists of several medium-sized florets with visible density, typical for cooked broccoli. Compared to the eggs and semoule on the plate, the broccoli pieces are compact and layered in a small mound but not piled excessively. The plate size and visible food portions suggest a modest portion, common in Swiss servings. Considering the size of each floret (about 4-5 cm in length) and typical density of cooked broccoli (about 0.34 g/cm³), the total volume seems to correspond to roughly 100-130 grams. Given the broccoli's volume and the visual fullness of the pieces, I estimate the weight of the broccoli to be about 120 grams, which is a medium portion."

The image shows two whole tomatoes and six olives on top of a black container lid, which provides a useful size reference. The olives are relatively large, marinated, and have a glossy surface. Each olive is about 3-4 cm in length, consistent with large green olives. Considering their average density and size, each olive typically weighs around 4-5 grams. Counting all six olives yields a total weight range of 24 to 30 grams. Given the visible size and marinated state (which adds some weight but not much), I estimate a medium portion, so approximately 27 grams is reasonable for the six olives shown."

The image shows two whole tomatoes placed side by side on a wooden surface. Each tomato appears medium-sized compared to the container lid below them, which serves as a reference object. A typical medium tomato in Swiss portion sizes weighs around 120-150 grams. Both tomatoes look firm, round, and of average size, typical for fresh market tomatoes. Therefore, the combined weight of the two tomatoes likely falls between 240 and 300 grams. Taking a balanced estimate based on their visual size and density, I assign an approximate weight of 270 grams for both tomatoes combined."

The image shows a bowl filled with potato chips. I count roughly 35-45 chips visibly layered in the bowl with some overlap and stacking, suggesting about a medium portion. The bowl is a small to medium size, roughly comparable to a standard cereal bowl of about 15 cm diameter. Potato chips are a light, crisp snack made mostly from thinly sliced potatoes fried to a low density. A typical chip weighs around 1 to 1.5 grams depending on size and thickness. Given the visual volume, stacking, and typical chip weight, the total weight seems to fall in the range of roughly 40 to 65 grams. Considering the chips fill about half to two-thirds of a standard bowl, I estimate the weight conservatively at around 55 grams of chips."

The image shows a glass jar with a mixture containing visible chia seeds, oats, and a creamy white substance likely the beaten egg white or yogurt base. The target food item is 'miel' (honey), which is visible as a pale drizzle or small quantity on the inner rim of the jar near the top. The honey is not the dominant component and appears as a thin layer or streak rather than a large quantity pooled at the bottom or mixed thoroughly. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes and the visible amount covering a small surface area inside the jar, this corresponds roughly to a teaspoon or less of honey. A teaspoon of honey weighs approximately 7 grams. Given the visual evidence of just a light coating and small drips, I estimate the honey in the jar to weigh around 5 grams, reflecting a small serving of honey used mainly as a sweetener rather than a large volume."

The target food item is 'blanc battu', a type of cultured buttermilk or whipped fermented milk typical in Switzerland, which has a creamy but somewhat fluid texture. In the image, the blanc battu is the white creamy substance filling the jar almost to the top, mixed with visible chia seeds and oats. The jar is a small glass container, roughly the size of a 200 ml jar. Given the density of blanc battu, close to that of milk/yogurt (around 1 g/ml), and the jar volume filled approximately 3/4, I estimate roughly 150 ml of blanc battu present. This leads to an estimated weight of about 150 grams, as liquids and similar dairy products are close to 1 g/ml. Considering slight integrations with chia seeds and oats that are heavier but low volume, the blanc battu weight alone is not significantly affected. Therefore, I estimate the blanc battu weight to be around 150 grams, accounting for Swiss portion sizes and the jar size visible."

The image shows a small glass jar filled with a mixed preparation containing visible chia seeds suspended in a creamy mixture, which also includes flocons d'avoine (oat flakes). The oat flakes are not visible as separate flakes but rather appear to be hydrated and mixed into the semi-liquid mass, indicating they have absorbed some liquid and swollen. The jar is a small size, roughly similar to a small yogurt jar (about 150-200 ml volume). Given the visual density and hydration state, the oat flakes likely contribute a smaller solid mass within the total mix. Considering Swiss portion sizes, a typical serving of oats in such a jar for a single portion would be around 30-40 grams dry weight, which swells significantly when hydrated. Given the volume occupied by the oats and their density (dense but expanded by hydration), I estimate the oat flakes weight here to be about 35 grams."

The target food item is ""graines de chia"" (chia seeds) mixed visibly in a creamy white base inside a small glass jar. The seeds are dispersed throughout the mixture, but we need to isolate their weight. The jar size is about 250 ml, often used for small portions. The chia seeds absorb liquid and swell, but their actual weight remains relatively small compared to the volume. Visually, the chia seeds occupy roughly 20-25% of the volume of the content inside the jar. Considering dry chia seed density is about 0.7 g/ml, but here they are hydrated and mixed, so effective weight per volume is less. We estimate the total weight of seeds visible to be about 25-30 grams for this portion size in Swiss context, as the rest of the volume is mostly liquid and whipped egg white. Given moderate portion size and partial swelling of seeds, I conservatively estimate 27 grams of hydrated chia seeds in this jar."

The image shows a small jar filled with a homogenous creamy mixture that includes visible chia seeds suspended in a creamy base, likely made of the listed ingredients. The target food item is 'purée d'amande' (almond butter), which is likely the thicker, creamy off-white substance visible near the surface and smeared slightly along the inside of the jar. Given the jar's size (small glass jar approximately 7-8 cm tall, 6-7 cm diameter), the total content in the jar seems to be around 150-200 grams including all ingredients mixed. Considering the almond butter is mixed in moderate quantity rather than filling the jar, and typical recipes for such mixtures often apply roughly one spoonful (about 15-25 g) for flavor and creaminess, the estimated weight for the purée d'amande in this jar would be closer to 20 grams. This accounts for almond butter's density and the visible smears around the jar, suggesting a moderate amount without overfilling. Therefore, the weight is estimated at approximately 20 grams."

The image shows a single serving of natural yogurt in a small plastic container. Its size and shape are consistent with typical Swiss yogurt portions, which usually range from 100 to 125 grams. The container appears to be mostly full with a smooth, homogeneous surface typical of natural yogurt. Given the density of yogurt is close to that of water, the weight in grams closely matches the volume in milliliters. Considering these aspects, the estimate leans towards a standard single serving of 125 grams, which is common in Swiss packaging for natural yogurt."

The target food item is 'framboises' (raspberries) in a bowl alongside bircher maison. The raspberries are clearly visible on the left half of the bowl, piled with some juice pooling underneath. By counting, there are approximately 18-20 whole raspberries or equivalent pieces. Each raspberry typically weighs around 3-4 grams when fresh, and they appear fresh and whole with natural volume and some juice, which adds a bit of weight. The raspberries are piled but not deeply stacked, suggesting a moderate portion volume fitting half the bowl, which is a small to medium Swiss serving bowl. Considering the density of raspberries (light, with hollow structure), the weight likely ranges between 55-75 grams. Given the visible amount and plateau, a confident estimate is near the midpoint - about 65 grams total raspberries, without including the bowl or other ingredients."

The apple is not cut or altered and includes the skin. Visually, the apple’s diameter seems around 7-8 cm, typical for a medium apple. Applying typical density for apples, which are water-rich but with some firmness, a medium apple usually weighs about 150-180 grams. Given that Swiss portions tend to be slightly smaller than US standards, I will estimate toward the lower-middle range of that typical weight. Therefore, the estimated weight of this pomme is approximately 160 grams."

The image shows a stack of four rectangular crackers identified as 'blévita graines de courges'. These crackers are thin and lightly textured with visible pumpkin seeds integrated into them. Each cracker appears roughly 7 cm by 5 cm in surface area and about 2-3 mm in thickness. Considering the density typical of crispbread with seeds, each cracker should weigh approximately 10-12 grams. With four crackers stacked, the total weight would be about 40-48 grams. The visible stack is compact without gaps, and no parts are hidden or broken. Given Swiss portion sizes tend to be moderate, a weight estimation closer to the middle of this range is sensible. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of these four blévita graines de courges crackers to be 44 grams."

The glass appears to be a small drinking glass, roughly 7-9 cm tall and about 5-6 cm in diameter at the rim, based on the visible size and shape, common for such glassware. The dressing fills approximately 1/5 to 1/6 of the glass height, forming a relatively thin layer at the bottom. Given the density of salad dressings, which are typically liquid with oil and vinegar base and some herb particulates, the density is close to water but slightly less or more depending on oil content, but for estimation, assume near 1g/mL. Estimating the volume visually: if the glass capacity is about 150 mL, 1/6 of that is about 25 mL. The weight of 25 mL dressing is close to 23-27 grams. Considering minor volume estimation uncertainties and that the liquid is visible and not aerated, I estimate the weight at around 25 grams."

The target food item is 'yaourt nature', which is visible in a small plastic container next to an apple. The container appears to be a standard single-serving yogurt pot common in Swiss and European contexts, typically around 125 grams. The yogurt fills the container nearly to the top, so the entire content can be counted. Given the size comparison to the apple (which looks like a small to medium apple), the pot's size and shape confirm the yogurt portion is standard and not unusually large or small. Therefore, the weight of the 'yaourt nature' is estimated to be approximately 125 grams."

These types of bars typically consist of puffed grains and small dried fruit pieces, giving them a moderate density. Visually, the bar is approximately the size of a finger segment, roughly about 8 cm long, 2.5 cm wide, and about 1 cm thick, judging by the texture and typical dimension of such bars. Given the puffed grains reduce overall density, but dried fruit adds some weight, a typical energy bar of this size would weigh between 20 and 30 grams.

Typical density is about 0.7-0.9 grams per cubic centimeter. For a chunk volume around 15-20 cubic centimeters, each chunk should weigh roughly 12-18 grams. Multiplying by 13 pieces gives a total weight range of 156-234 grams. Considering the pieces vary slightly in size, I select a medium portion estimate at around 190 grams. This value accounts for visible volume, density, and typical portion size in a Swiss context."

The target food item is 'muesli nature,' which is the granola-like clusters in the small brown bowl on the right. Step 1: Visual Identification - The muesli consists of multiple clumps of oats and grains compacted together filling the bowl. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The bowl is small, roughly the size of a small dessert bowl, likely about 8-9 cm in diameter and 4-5 cm deep. The muesli fills it almost to the top but loosely packed, so the volume is moderate. Step 3: Density Considerations - Muesli clusters are light but denser than loose cereals because they are clumped; typical density for muesli is around 0.3 to 0.4 g/cm3. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The amount visually appears to be a small to medium Swiss-sized portion. Estimating the bowl volume roughly as a cylinder: π * (4.5 cm radius)^2 * 4.5 cm height ≈ 285 cm3. Considering the irregularities and less-than-full packing, volume of muesli is about 200 cm3. At 0.35 g/cm3 density, this gives about 70 grams. Step 5: Cross Validation - Typical small muesli servings range from 40 to 80 grams, so 70 grams is plausible. Therefore, the estimated weight of the muesli nature is about 70 grams."

The target food item is 'yaourt nature' which is in the square white bowl on the left side of the image. The bowl has handles on both sides and is about the size of a small dessert bowl, roughly 10 cm wide. The yogurt appears to fill approximately half of the bowl's depth, with a smooth, thick texture typical of natural yogurt. Given the dimensions and typical serving sizes in Switzerland, a small bowl like this would hold around 120-150 grams of yogurt when half-filled. Considering its density and the visible volume, this portion corresponds to a medium-sized serving of natural yogurt. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'yaourt nature' to be approximately 140 grams."

The target food item is a 'balisto : choco chips,' which visually appears as a granola or cereal bar with a topping of chocolate chips. In the image, there is a single rectangular bar placed on a wooden surface. The bar is about the size of a typical snack bar, roughly estimated as around 10 cm in length and approximately 3-4 cm in width and about 1-1.5 cm thick. Given that Balisto bars are processed snack items with nuts, grains, and chocolate chips, their density is relatively high, but still less dense than pure chocolate because of the mixed ingredients. Standard Balisto bars of this size typically weigh between 25 and 30 grams. The presence of chocolate chips on top also adds minor weight. Since the bar appears intact and matches the typical processed bar size, I estimate its weight closer to the middle of this range, around 28 grams."
p96w4a,pizza,100.0,100.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/fe1a8601-1302-4ab5-b294-a76780f6643b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single slice of pizza on a white plate. The plate appears to be a small to medium size plate, which helps estimate the size of the slice. The pizza slice is thin-crust with visible tomato sauce, melted cheese, and a couple of basil leaves. The crust is lightly browned and thin, suggesting a typical Neapolitan-style pizza slice. Given the visual size—roughly covering about one quarter or slightly less of the plate diameter—the slice likely weighs less than a typical thick or heavily topped slice. Considering the thin crust, moderate cheese and sauce coverage, and Swiss portion norms which tend to be smaller, this slice would be estimated at about 90 to 110 grams. Taking the middle of this range, I estimate the weight of this pizza slice to be approximately 100 grams."

The image shows a single piece of dark chocolate from the brand Villars. The size of the chocolate piece can be visually compared to the texture and width of the wooden table planks, suggesting it is roughly the size of a typical standard chocolate bar segment. Such segments usually weigh between 10 and 15 grams depending on thickness. This piece appears to have a standard thickness and is not broken down further, so it's safe to consider a medium portion estimate within that range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this single piece of Villars chocolate to be approximately 12 grams."
2ahgvr,redbull,250.0,250.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/b5bf1a7f-a9d6-4fd9-a151-9658e738cc0a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a person holding a can of Red Bull energy drink. The can is clearly visible and appears to be the standard size, based on the hand holding it. In Switzerland and most European countries, the common standard size for a Red Bull can is 250 ml. Since Red Bull is a liquid with roughly the same density as water, the weight in grams approximately equals the volume in milliliters. Therefore, the weight of the Red Bull in the can is about 250 grams. The container weight (aluminum can) is excluded as per the instructions, so the estimation focuses solely on the liquid content, which is 250 grams."
