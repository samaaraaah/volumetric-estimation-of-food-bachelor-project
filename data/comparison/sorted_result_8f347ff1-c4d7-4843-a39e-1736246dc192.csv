The image shows five grilled chicken drumsticks (pillons de poulet) situated on the left side of the plate. Each drumstick appears medium-sized, typical of a homemade portion. A single cooked chicken drumstick generally weighs between 80 and 110 grams including bone, but edible meat is less. Considering the five drumsticks visible, a plausible range for total weight is about 400 to 550 grams. Given the size and visible quantity, it is reasonable to estimate the total weight near the middle of this range, around 475 grams. This estimate accounts for some variance in drumstick size and cooking water loss but is grounded in the visible portion size and typical French/Swiss meal portions."

The specified food item includes 'pizza champignons, olives, courgettes,' which is visible on the plate as 5 slices of pizza, slightly burnt on the edges. The slice size and thickness appear typical for a home-style or restaurant pizza with a thin to standard-crust base. Each slice shows toppings of mushrooms, black olives, and zucchini slices along with cheese and sauce. Given the size of the plate (standard large dinner plate approx. 27 cm diameter) and the pizza slices taking up roughly two-thirds of the plate, each slice is estimated to be about 80 to 100 grams, considering the vegetables and cheese toppings. Multiplying by the 5 slices gives roughly a total pizza weight of 400-500 grams. Since the question specifies the whole pizza with all toppings, I estimate the total weight at the midpoint, around 450 grams."

The image shows a small cardboard tray filled with about 20 cherry tomatoes, some still attached to a green vine. Cherry tomatoes are small and dense with an average weight of about 15 grams each. The tomatoes appear fresh and firm, fitting tightly in the container. Considering the number of tomatoes (approximately 20) and the typical weight per tomato, the total weight likely ranges from 280 grams (if slightly smaller at 14 g each) up to 320 grams (assuming 16 g each). Choosing a midpoint estimate near 300 grams is reasonable and consistent with the visual size and quantity of the tomatoes shown."
2ahgvr,colrave crue,118.0,315.0,197.0,2.8129235237173282,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/3718d88c-ba98-4da1-84dc-7d5ad0a4df92,"Let's work this out in a step-by-step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows peeled and sliced raw kohlrabi (colrave crue) placed on a white plastic container lid. Each piece is roughly triangular and about 3 to 5 cm in length. Kohlrabi has a dense, crunchy texture similar to that of a firm turnip or apple. The total volume of the pieces is moderate, taking up about two-thirds of the lid surface, which is roughly 20 cm by 12 cm in size. Assuming a thickness of about 1.5 to 2 cm on average, the total volume is approximately 360 to 480 cm³. Considering kohlrabi's density is around 0.7 to 0.8 g/cm³ for raw, peeled vegetable, the weight range would be roughly 250 to 380 grams. Taking the midpoint for a balanced estimate, I choose about 315 grams. This estimate fits the visual size and typical density of raw kohlrabi."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,235.0,182.0,9.183688286544047,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step-by-step way to be sure we have the right answer. The salad consists mostly of tomato slices arranged on a medium-sized plate about 22-24 cm in diameter. The tomatoes are cut into wedges and slices that cover the plate surface generously but not piled high. Each tomato wedge appears medium-sized, typical of a medium tomato weighing about 150-170 grams whole. Visually, this looks like approximately 1.5 medium tomatoes worth of tomato slices, given how the plate is mostly covered but not stacked. This suggests a plausible weight range of about 200-270 grams. Considering the density of fresh tomatoes and visible quantity, I estimate the weight of the tomato salad to be approximately 235 grams."

The 'viande' (meat) portion is located on the left side of the plate. It appears as a single cooked ground meat patty, roughly rectangular and about the size of a large palm. Given the dimensions relative to the knife and the laptop keyboard behind, the meat piece is approximately 10 cm long and 5 cm wide, with a thickness around 1.5 cm. Ground cooked meat density typically ranges around 250-280 g per 100 cm3. Estimating the volume as length × width × height (10 × 5 × 1.5 = 75 cm3), the weight range would be approximately 188g (250×0.75) to 210g (280×0.75). Considering some moisture loss and irregular shape, I estimate the weight at the midpoint of this range, around 200 grams. This estimate seems plausible given the portion size and density of cooked ground meat."

The specified food is 'légumes sautés (carottes, poireaux)', which are sautéed carrots and leeks. Visually, they occupy about a quarter of the plate. The plate appears to be a standard medium-sized dinner plate, approximately 23 cm in diameter. The sautéed vegetables form an uneven pile roughly 8 cm by 6 cm in area and about 1.5–2 cm in average height, taking into account some flattening. The volume is approximately 72 cm³ (8x6x1.5). Sautéed vegetables like these are relatively low density, roughly 0.5–0.7 g/cm³ considering water content and cooking method. This gives a weight range roughly between 36 g (0.5x72) and 50 g (0.7x72). Given the visible portion and judging the compactness of the vegetables, a sensible estimate for the weight is near the midpoint at about 43 grams. This estimate fits well with a moderate sautéed vegetable side portion and visually matches the amount on this plate."

The image shows a metal container with cooked fusilli pasta on the right side, covered with a generous amount of grated parmesan. The pasta portion fills roughly half of the container's length and about the full width, with a depth appearing to be around 2 to 3 cm given the container's overall size and the visible volume beneath the parmesan. Using the visible container size (comparable to a standard lunchbox tray, approximately 20 cm by 12 cm), the pasta occupies about half the tray area, roughly 120 cm², and with a 2.5 cm depth this corresponds to approximately 300 ml volume. Cooked pasta has a density close to 0.9 g/ml, so the weight range is roughly 250 to 350 grams. Given the visible portion and slight space between pasta pieces, I estimate the pasta weight at about 300 grams. The range of 250-350 grams helps factor in some uncertainty in depth and density from sauce absorption."

The image shows a small bowl filled with fresh blueberries (myrtilles). The blueberries appear plump and uniformly sized, filling the bowl near its rim. Considering the bowl is held in a hand, it is likely a small dessert or cereal bowl, approximately 10 cm in diameter and about 4-5 cm deep. Blueberries typically weigh around 0.8-1 gram each. Based on the visible volume and blueberries per layer, I estimate the bowl contains approximately 50 to 60 grams of blueberries. Therefore, a reasonable weight range is 50-60 grams, and I choose a midpoint estimate of 55 grams as the best approximation for the weight of the blueberries in this bowl."

The courgette and onions occupy roughly half of a standard rectangular glass container, alongside five millet, black bean, and corn patties. Visually, the courgette pieces are sliced into small chunks mixed with onion, lightly cooked. Given the container appears to be about 15 cm x 15 cm, and the courgette-onion mixture fills roughly half its volume at a shallow depth (~3-4 cm), the volume is approximately 180-250 ml. Considering the low density of cooked courgette and onions, which have a density slightly less than water due to water loss but presence of fibrous content, I estimate a density around 0.8-1 g/ml. Thus, the weight range is approximately 140-210 grams. Choosing a midpoint, the estimate is 175 grams. This fits the visual volume and typical cooked vegetable density without overestimation."

The plate shows sliced carrots and a quinoa-bulgur mix. The carrots are cut into thick round slices, and there are about 14 visible pieces. Each slice looks about 2 cm thick and about 3.5-4 cm in diameter. Carrots are dense and heavy for their size. Given that a medium carrot weighs roughly 60-70 grams and that the amount of carrot here corresponds roughly to half a medium carrot, I estimate the carrot weight range around 50 to 70 grams. The midpoint estimate is therefore about 60 grams. This is plausible considering the volume and known density of cooked carrots on a plate of this size."

The image shows a rectangular container divided into three sections with tomato slices, mozzarella pieces, and millet. The tomatoes are sliced fairly thin and fill about one-third of the container. Based on the container size (roughly the size of a typical meal prep container around 15cm by 10cm) and the layer thickness (about 1-1.5 cm), the tomato portion volume is approximately 150-180 ml. Considering the density of tomato (about 0.95 g/ml), the plausible weight range is around 140-170 grams. Midpoint about 155 grams is reasonable. The tomato slices visually appear fresh and dense, matching this estimation. This weight fits well with visual size comparison to mozzarella chunks above, and millet below, making it plausible overall."

The raviolis à la courge are the main item on the plate, identifiable as square pasta filled with pumpkin. There are about 7 raviolis visible, covering a portion of the plate. Considering their size relative to the cherry tomatoes and shredded iceberg lettuce nearby, each ravioli is roughly 4-5 cm wide. Cooked filled pasta is dense and moist, with an average weight of about 30-40 grams each, depending on filling. For 7 raviolis, a plausible total weight range is 210 to 280 grams. The raviolis appear moderately sized and not overly thick or dense, so a midpoint estimate of about 245 grams seems reasonable. I have not overestimated thickness or assumed hidden raviolis, only counting visible pieces. This estimate aligns well with typical Swiss portion sizes for filled pasta dishes."

The croissants au jambon are two small to medium-sized croissants filled with ham, situated on the left side of the plate. Each croissant appears typical in size, about the size of a palm, and looks dense due to the pastry and ham inside. A plain small croissant typically weighs around 50-60 grams, and adding ham filling could increase that by about 10-20 grams per croissant. Therefore, estimating each croissant au jambon to be around 60-70 grams is reasonable. For two croissants, this gives a range of approximately 120-140 grams. Choosing a midpoint, I estimate the total weight of the two croissants au jambon to be 130 grams."

The salade de pâtes is visible as a small leftover portion on a white plate. The pasta pieces are penne, and there are some visible corn kernels and small bits of tomato and herbs mixed in. A full serving of pasta salad typically weighs around 200-250g. Considering the size of the plate and the small amount remaining, I estimate this leftover portion to be roughly 8-12% of a standard serving. This suggests a plausible weight range of approximately 16 to 30 grams. Given the visible volume and density of cooked pasta, I choose an estimated weight near the midpoint, about 23 grams. This estimate balances the visible size with typical pasta salad density and volume."

The container is roughly the size of a typical meal prep box, about 15 cm wide, 10 cm long, and around 5 cm deep, partially filled to approximately three-quarters. Greek salad ingredients like cucumber, tomato, bell peppers, onion, olives, and feta are moderately dense but contain water and air space. Estimating the volume at roughly 500 ml, and considering that a Greek salad typically weighs around 0.8 grams per ml due to moisture and cheese content, the total weight range is approximately 350–450 grams. Choosing near the middle of this range, I estimate the Greek salad weight to be about 400 grams. This aligns with the portion size visible and the container fill level, making it a plausible estimation."

The blueberries are whole, medium-sized and dispersed throughout; approximately 15-20 blueberries are visibly identifiable. A typical fresh blueberry weighs about 1-1.5 grams. Given the visible count and estimate for some possibly hidden blueberries under the yogurt mixture, I estimate the total weight range of the blueberries to be from 15 grams (minimum visible count) to about 30 grams (if some are hidden). Taking a midpoint estimate, I select approximately 23 grams as a plausible weight for the blueberries in this bowl, which fits the volume and density observed without overestimation."

The vegetables occupy about one-third of a standard dinner plate, alongside rice and a fried egg. The courgette slices are medium-sized and slightly translucent from cooking, mixed with visible onion slices that are similarly sautéed. Given the volume and the density of the vegetables after cooking (which reduces water content somewhat), a plausible minimum weight is about 90 grams (a modest sauté portion) and a maximum around 130 grams (a fuller sautéed serving). The midpoint of this range is approximately 110 grams. Considering the visible quantity and cooking shrinkage, I estimate the vegetable portion here to be about 110 grams."

The specified item is 'pomme' (apple), which is clearly visible in the image next to a croissant on a wooden table. The apple appears to be a small to medium-sized variety based on its comparison to the croissant. Typical small to medium apples weigh between 120 and 180 grams. Given the density and size, the volume is consistent with this range. The apple's visible size and shape suggest it is not an unusually large or small apple, so a midpoint estimate within this range is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the apple weighs approximately 150 grams."

The poulet (chicken) is the cooked piece of meat on the front right side of the plate. It appears to be a boneless chicken breast with some sauce or gravy. By comparing its size with the adjacent French fries and salad, it is roughly the size of a standard chicken breast portion. The chicken breast seems thick and dense, contributing to a moderate weight. A typical cooked chicken breast piece of this size usually weighs between 140 and 180 grams. Given the visible volume, density, and appearance, I estimate a range of about 140-180 grams, choosing a midpoint value of approximately 160 grams. This estimate is plausible considering typical serving portions and visible size relative to the plate and fries."

The image shows a small green bowl containing three large strawberries ('fraises'). Each strawberry is substantial in size, roughly about 6-8 cm in length, which suggests they are larger than average strawberries. A typical large strawberry weighs between 20 and 30 grams. Considering that these strawberries appear quite large and dense, a plausible weight range per strawberry is 25-35 grams. For the three strawberries combined, the total weight range would be approximately 75-105 grams. Choosing a value near the midpoint of this range, I estimate the total weight of these strawberries to be about 90 grams."

The image shows roughly six pieces of pear (poire) inside a transparent rectangular plastic container. The container is partially filled, and the visible pieces vary in size but appear to be fairly thick chunks from one average-sized pear. Given the size of each piece relative to the container (which is a small meal container, around 0.5 liter capacity), the total volume of pear is moderate. Pears are mostly water and have medium density; a medium pear typically weighs around 150-200 grams. These cut pieces likely represent about half to two-thirds of a pear, given their collective volume and cut shape. Therefore, estimating a weight range of 100-140 grams seems reasonable. Taking the midpoint, the estimated weight is 120 grams. This estimate fits the visible portion size and typical pear density without over- or underestimating."

Each patty is roughly 6-7 cm long and about 2 cm thick, with a dense texture. Given their composition (grains and legumes), their density is moderate to high. A typical millet bean patty of this size would weigh between 30 and 40 grams each. Estimating a range of 30-40 grams per patty, and with six patties visible, the total weight range is approximately 180 to 240 grams. Choosing a value near the midpoint, I estimate the total weight of the galettes to be about 210 grams. This is plausible given the size, density, and number of patties in the container."

Cooked asparagus spears usually weigh around 15-20 grams each. Given this, the total weight range would be approximately 7 x 15 = 105 grams to 7 x 20 = 140 grams. Considering some variability in thickness and moisture loss during cooking, I estimate the weight near the midpoint of this range. Therefore, the weight of the asparagus is about 122 grams.

The specified item 'chips vaya beans' are clearly visible and are a type of thin, crisp chip made mainly from beans, with visible green and purple bean fragments. The chips are placed on a standard-sized dessert or small dinner plate, approximately 20-22 cm in diameter. The pile of chips fills roughly the central round low area of the plate, appearing to be a moderate portion. Given the light and airy texture of bean chips, they tend to weigh less than typical corn chips, around 0.5-0.7 grams per chip on average. Visually estimating, the pile contains around 20 to 30 chips of varying sizes. Assuming an average chip weight of about 0.6 grams, the total weight range plausibly lies between 12 grams (20 chips) and 21 grams (35 chips). Considering the pile size and thickness, a midpoint estimate near 16 grams is reasonable. This aligns with typical snack portion sizes for such light chips. Therefore, the estimated weight for the 'chips vaya beans' in the image is approximately 16 grams."

Each slice is thin, and the total volume is moderate compared to the other ingredients. Considering the typical density and moisture content of cooked or sautéed bell pepper, the weight range can be estimated. The total visible amount looks to be roughly the equivalent of half a medium bell pepper, which usually weighs around 100-150 g when raw. Since it appears cooked and thus slightly reduced in water content but still fairly dense, a weight estimate range of 70-110 grams is plausible. Taking the midpoint, a reasonable estimate is about 90 grams."

Using common size references for apples and relative to the texture and shadows on the surface, its diameter is roughly 6-7 cm. Typical small to medium apples in Switzerland weigh between 120 and 160 grams. Considering the size and visual cues, a plausible weight range is 120-160 grams. Selecting a value near the midpoint, I estimate the apple weighs about 140 grams. This estimate is reasonable and consistent with the visible size and typical weight range of similar apples."

The spaghetti is visible on a plate, with a moderate portion appearing well spread but without being heaped. The plate size relative to a lighter object (visible lighter) indicates a standard dinner plate circa 25cm diameter. The spaghetti portion covers a good central area but is not piled deeply. Considering cooked spaghetti density (roughly 1.2g/ml) and typical serving visual size, the visible spaghetti portion is estimated in a range of about 150 to 200 grams. A midpoint estimate of 175 grams is reasonable given the volume and density visible."

The image shows a bowl with four millet patties on the right side and a tomato and onion salad on the left. The millet patties contain visible black beans (haricots noirs) and corn (maïs), likely mixed into the patties themselves. Each patty is roughly 7-8 cm in diameter and about 1-1.5 cm thick. Millet patties made with beans and corn have a medium density, somewhat comparable to dense vegetable patties. Based on their size and thickness, each patty likely weighs between 50 and 70 grams. With four patties present, the total weight range would be approximately 200 to 280 grams. Selecting a value near the midpoint accounting for slight charring (which may indicate some moisture loss), I estimate the total weight of the four millet, black bean, and corn patties at about 240 grams."

The image shows a plate with three main food items: brown rice (riz complet) on the left, grilled salmon pieces on the right upper side, and a grated carrot and corn salad on the bottom. The brown rice portion takes up about one quarter of the plate and is presented as a dense mound approximately 10 cm wide and 2.5 cm high. Given the size of the plate (typical dinner plate of about 24-26 cm diameter) and relative volume of the rice compared to other items, this looks like a standard serving of cooked brown rice. Cooked brown rice density is about 130-140 g per cup (cooked volume approx. 150-160 ml per 100 g). This portion appears to be roughly 150-180 ml in volume. Thus, the plausible weight range is approximately 110 to 130 grams. Estimating near the midpoint, I place the brown rice weight at about 120 grams. This aligns with a moderate portion size common in Swiss meals and reconciles with visual volume and density considerations."

The item to estimate is the 'gaufre' (waffle) visible in the image on a plate with a colorful fish pattern. The waffle is rectangular, approximately 10 cm long and 7 cm wide, with a typical thickness of around 1.5 cm. Considering its visible volume and the usual density of waffles, which is moderately dense due to the batter composition, a typical portion size for this thickness and dimension ranges between 75 and 100 grams. Given the clear visible size and standard waffle density, an estimate near the midpoint is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the waffle to be about 85 grams."

The specified food to estimate is 'pâtes'. The pasta portion takes up roughly one-third of the plate surface and is a medium thickness spiral pasta. Considering that cooked pasta is dense and the portion covers a roughly 10 cm diameter area with moderate height (about 2-3 cm thick layer), I estimate a volume that corresponds to approximately 140 to 180 grams. Given that cooked pasta is dense and the visible portion is not heaped but rather moderately piled, I choose a value near the midpoint, about 160 grams. This aligns with typical Swiss portion sizes for a pasta serving of this visual volume on a dinner plate."

The salade de pâtes (pasta salad) is clearly visible at the bottom left of the plate. It consists of spiral pasta with visible pieces of vegetables like corn, cucumber, and tomato mixed in. The portion of pasta salad covers a moderate area on the plate and is about 2-3 cm thick. Considering that cooked pasta is dense and the visible portion roughly corresponds to a handful or small serving, a typical cooked pasta density of about 1.3 g/ml is plausible. The visible quantity likely ranges between 90 and 130 grams. Choosing a midpoint value while accounting for some vegetable volume that reduces pasta weight slightly, I estimate the weight of the salade de pâtes to be approximately 110 grams."

The maréchal cheese pieces are cut into small cubes located centrally on the plate among the salad. Each cube is roughly about 2 cm in size, and there are 5 visible cubes. A typical cheese cube of this size weighs about 10-12 grams. Considering slight size variation and density, the total weight range for these 5 cubes would be approximately 45-60 grams. The midpoint and plausible estimate based on visual volume and density of semihard cheese types like maréchal is about 52 grams. This estimation fits the visible size and typical density of the cheese."

The container is approximately 20 cm square, and the épautre occupies about a third of the container's base area and is filled to a moderate depth. Cooked spelled grains are dense, similar in density to cooked wheat, roughly 0.85-1.1 g/ml. Given the visible fill level and the grain size, a plausible volume is about 180-250 ml. This translates to approximately 160-230 grams. Choosing a midpoint near 195 grams seems reasonable. This estimate maintains a plausible mass for the volume observed and aligns with typical cooked grain portions for meals in Switzerland."

The salade verte is located on the bottom right quadrant of the plate, consisting of leafy lettuce coated lightly with dressing. The lettuce leaves appear fresh and not densely packed, with some visible space around them. Lettuce is a low-density food, and the portion is modest. Comparing the size of the salad portion to the fork width (~2 cm per tine) and the plate rim size, the salad covers roughly a 7 cm by 6 cm area with some thickness of around 2-3 cm. Given that lettuce density is around 100-150 g per liter and accounting for dressing, a plausible weight range would be 40-70 grams. Choosing a midpoint near 55 grams makes sense to represent this visually moderate portion of salade verte on the plate."

The image shows a single slice of a strawberry tart (tarte aux fraises) on a standard sized dessert plate. The slice is about one-eighth of a typical round tart judging by the curve and remnants on the plate. The tart slice has a pastry crust base which is visible as thin and flaky, a creamy filling, and several strawberry halves along with some red currants. The strawberries appear fresh and medium-sized; typical weight for the visible strawberries on the slice is around 70-90 grams since they cover the surface densely. The cream filling and crust combined likely add another 40-60 grams given the thickness and density visible. Putting this together, a reasonable weight range is approximately 110 to 150 grams. Choosing a midpoint estimate and considering visual density, I estimate the weight of this tart slice to be about 130 grams."

The image shows a stack of four Blevita crackers, which are a known processed food item in Switzerland. Blevita crackers generally weigh about 12-13 grams per piece. Since there are four crackers stacked together, the combined weight should be around 48-52 grams. Considering the typical average weight per cracker and the visible quantity, I estimate the weight of the Blevita crackers in the image to be approximately 50 grams."

The sauce bolognese is clearly visible in the image as the reddish-brown meat and tomato sauce spread on top of the pasta. The portion covers a central area approximately 8-10 cm in length and 5-6 cm in width, with a moderate thickness of about 1.5 cm. Given that cooked bolognese sauce has a density close to 1 g/ml and considering the volume visually (roughly 90-120 ml), the sauce's weight would likely lie between 85 and 125 grams. Considering the visual cues and typical serving sizes in Swiss meals, a reasonable estimate is near the midpoint, about 105 grams. This final value aligns with the physical size, coverage, and expected sauce density, making it a plausible and grounded estimation."

The image shows two rolled galettes (thin flatbreads) that are placed inside a metal container. The galettes appear to be of standard size, similar to wraps or flatbreads typically used in Switzerland. Each galette is thin and dense, and collectively, they fill roughly half of the container's length and width. Considering that a typical galette wrap usually weighs between 50 and 70 grams, and there appear to be about two full wraps (rolled), I estimate the total weight of these galettes to be in the range of about 100 to 140 grams. Choosing a midpoint closer to 120 grams is reasonable given the size and volume of the visible bread portion. I am confident this estimation excludes the filling as it relates strictly to the pain/galette weight itself."

The bread appears to be of a medium density, typical of artisanal whole grain or multigrain bread, and each slice looks roughly 10 cm long and about 5-6 cm wide, with an average thickness of about 1.5 to 2 cm. A customary slice of this type of bread would weigh between 30 and 45 grams. Since these slices are somewhat thick and hearty, I estimate each slice to be around 40 grams. Given the three slices, the total weight range is roughly 90 to 135 grams. Near the midpoint, I estimate the weight of the three slices of bread (pain) combined to be about 110 grams in total. But since the task is to estimate the weight of the specified 'pain' item as a whole (all slices present), 110 grams is a reasonable final estimate."

The scrambled eggs (oeufs brouillés) occupy the top left portion of the plate. They appear fluffy but dense, typical for cooked scrambled eggs. Using the gnocchi and cauliflower florets as size references, the scrambled eggs pile is roughly about 10 cm by 6 cm in area and about 2–3 cm thick. This corresponds to a volume of approximately 120–180 ml. Considering the density of scrambled eggs is about 0.8 g/ml, the weight is likely between 95 and 145 grams.

The mozzarella is the white dollop on top of the pasta. Its volume corresponds roughly to a small scoop about 5 cm long, 3 cm wide, and 2 cm thick at the thickest part. Mozzarella is a fresh cheese with a high moisture content, with density roughly around 0.9 g/cm3. Estimating the volume around 30 cm3 to 40 cm3, this translates to a weight range roughly from 27 grams to 36 grams. Taking a midpoint estimate to reflect the apparent density and volume, I estimate the mozzarella weight to be approximately 31 grams. This is plausible given the size compared to the pasta and beans, and the fact that it is a single, small serving dollop."

The specified item is the tartine with mélasse + beurre, which is the lower slice of bread on the plate. The bread slice appears to be a medium-sized rustic slice, roughly 12 cm long and about 5 cm wide, typical of a sliced baguette or country bread. The bread itself likely weighs around 40-50 grams considering its density and thickness. The butter spread is visibly thin but covers most of the slice, which I estimate at around 8-10 grams. The mélasse (molasses) layer is a thin, shiny coating spread evenly, with a small visible volume; molasses is dense but the volume is small, so I estimate around 6-8 grams for the spread. Combining these, the total weight range would be approximately 55-68 grams. I select a midpoint estimate of 62 grams for the tartine mélasse + beurre. This fits plausibly with the size and visible quantity of toppings without overestimation."

The specified item is 'pousses de graines' (sprouted seeds), which are visible as a light tangle of mostly mung bean and similar sprouts on the left-center part of the bowl. The sprouts look like a small mound, loosely packed over fresh spinach leaves. Based on the size of the bowl (standard medium salad bowl) and comparing the sprouts to the nearby cherry tomatoes (about 2-3 cm in length) and the fallafels (approximately 3-4 cm diameter), the quantity of sprouts seems to be around 40-60 grams. Sprouts are very low density and fluffy, so the visual volume corresponds to a relatively small weight. A range of about 35-65 grams seems plausible. Choosing a midpoint estimate gives around 50 grams. This is consistent with a modest portion of sprouts placed atop a salad as seen here."

Avocado flesh density is roughly 1 g/cm³. Estimating the volume of each slice as roughly 5 cm x 2 cm x 1 cm (considering the slice is about 1 cm thick on average), each slice would weigh about 10 grams. Two slices together would range between 15-20 grams depending on thickness.

The slice appears to be roughly triangular, about 12 cm at its longest edge and approximately 6-7 cm wide at the thickest part. The tart has a relatively thin pastry base and a layer of rhubarb pieces embedded in a custard-like filling. Rhubarb has a moderate density and the filling adds some weight but is not very thick. Typical rhubarb tart slices weigh between 100 to 150 grams depending on thickness. Given the visible size and thickness of this slice, I estimate a plausible weight range of about 110 to 140 grams.

Each galette appears roughly the size of a small palm, approximately 6-7 cm in diameter and about 1.5-2 cm thick. Considering the texture – a grain and bean mixture – it is moderately dense but porous, meaning the density is less than meat but more than a leafy salad. A typical galette of this size could weigh between 80 and 120 grams together for the two patties. Given this range, a midpoint estimate near 100 grams seems reasonable.

The pain bis consists of two slices of dense whole grain bread. Each slice appears to be of standard sandwich size, roughly 12-13 cm long and about 7-8 cm wide. Whole grain bread has a typical density around 250-270 g per 1000 cm³. Each slice looks to be around 1.2 cm thick. Based on these dimensions, one slice likely weighs between 50-60 grams. Since the estimation is for 'pain bis' which likely refers to one slice only, and considering slight variations in bread density and moisture, a reasonable weight range is 50-60 grams. Choosing a value near the midpoint, the estimated weight is 55 grams."

The image shows a single small slice of pizza on a standard-sized plate. The slice has visible toppings that appear to be mushrooms. Considering the size of the plate edge and the fork/knife nearby, the pizza slice is roughly about 10 cm long and 5-6 cm wide at its widest part. The crust thickness is moderate, indicating a typical home-style or thin to medium crust pizza. Pizza tends to be dense due to dough, sauce, cheese, and toppings. A typical thin to medium crust small pizza slice of this size weighs between approximately 60 to 90 grams. Given the relatively small size and visible toppings density, I estimate the weight to be about the midpoint of this range, around 75 grams. This estimate is plausible given the slice size relative to the plate and typical pizza slice weights in Swiss portions."

The mélasse (molasses) is spread on one slice of bread on the top of the plate. The bread slice is a typical size of about 15 cm long and 7 cm wide. The mélasse layer is thin and patchy, not covering the whole slice evenly. Given the thin coating, the amount of mélasse visually looks to be about 1–2 tablespoons spread thin. Since molasses density is about 1.4 g/ml, and 1 tablespoon is approximately 15 ml, a thin cover would weigh between 15 to 30 grams. Considering the visible spread and thickness, an estimate near the midpoint around 22 grams seems plausible. This is consistent with the physical size and volume appearance of the molasses on the slice."

The carrots are visible as thin slices and small pieces mixed mainly with the aubergines and pasta in the white bowl. Compared to the other components, the carrot pieces are thin and sparse, mostly on one side of the bowl. The bowl appears to be about 15-17 cm in diameter, based on typical table and chair references. Given the visible volume of carrot, spread thinly in slices, the total carrot mass is limited. Considering carrot density and volume, a plausible weight range is about 15-30 grams. Near the midpoint, the estimate is about 22 grams. This aligns with the modest visible amount without overestimating hidden volume."

The salad portion appears to be about the size of a small handful, approximately 6-7 cm in length and 4-5 cm in width, with a thin layer and some overlapping leaves. Considering the density of lettuce and similar salad ingredients, which are mostly water and light, the weight is likely low. A typical handful of fresh salad weighs around 20-40 grams. The visible amount here seems closer to the lower middle part of this range. Therefore, a plausible weight range would be 25-35 grams, with a midpoint estimate around 30 grams. This seems reasonable given the portion size and visual density."

The item to estimate is 'salade'. The salad portion occupies roughly one third of a standard-sized plate. The leaves appear fresh and lightly dressed, slightly dense but mostly leafy volume with some sunflower seeds sprinkled on top. A fresh leaf salad of this visible size in Switzerland usually weighs less than dense vegetables due to water content and air gaps. Considering the plate diameter approximately 25 cm and the volume the salad occupies, a plausible weight range is 35-55 grams. The texture and compactness suggest a mid-range estimate of about 45 grams is reasonable. This avoids an overestimation given the airy nature of the leaves and limited depth visible."

A typical tablespoon of mayonnaise weighs about 14-15 grams, and the portion here appears slightly less than a full tablespoon but more than a teaspoon. Considering this, a plausible range for this visible portion is approximately 10-16 grams. Selecting a midpoint within this range, I estimate the mayonnaise weight to be 13 grams."

The specified food item 'séré maigre' is visible as the primary creamy base mixed with chia seeds and hazelnut purée in the bowl. The bowl looks medium-sized, roughly 12-14 cm in diameter, and the creamy mixture fills most of the bowl, but not fully to the top. Given the texture and density of low-fat cultured cheese (séré maigre), it is quite dense and thick, similar to yogurt but slightly denser. The mixture appears to contain about 150-200 ml volume. Considering the addition of chia seeds and purée, the density increases somewhat, but the base weight estimation is primarily for the séré. The plausible weight range for séré maigre in this volume is approximately 140-180 grams, given typical density around 1 g/ml for this type of product. Thus, estimating near the midpoint, the weight is around 160 grams."

Considering this and the number of slices, a plausible weight range is about 25 to 35 grams. Choosing the midpoint for accuracy, I estimate the salami weight to be 30 grams. This estimate fits well with the visual volume and density, and is consistent with typical sliced salami portion sizes seen in Switzerland."

Given their composition of millet, black beans, and corn, they are relatively dense but not as heavy as pure meat. Typical density for such grain-bean patties is about 0.8-1.0 g/ml. Visually, the three patties collectively occupy roughly the equivalent volume of a small to medium bowl scoop, estimated around 150-220 grams. Considering size, volume, and density, a plausible weight range is 160-210 grams. Positioning near the midpoint, I estimate approximately 185 grams for the three galettes combined."

The 'salade de céleri' is the shredded white salad item located at the bottom right corner of the plate. Comparing its size relative to the plate and the nearby items, especially the carrot salad (top right) and the potato salad (bottom left), the celery salad portion is a moderate small heap. The plate appears to be a standard size (around 25 cm wide). The celery salad portion looks dense and compact but not overly piled up, roughly covering an area of about 8x6 cm with a thickness around 2 cm. Given that shredded celery has a moderately dense texture, I estimate a density close to 0.6-0.7 g/cm3. Volume estimation: 8 cm * 6 cm * 2 cm = 96 cm3. Weight range estimated between 55 g and 70 g considering some lightness and air gaps. Choosing a midpoint value near 63 grams is plausible.

The chia seeds are spread relatively evenly and embedded in the mixture, not piled separately. Typically, chia seeds used in such a serving would weigh between 15 and 25 grams depending on the amount for nutritional purposes. Visually, they occupy a modest volume but are dense. Given the total jar content volume estimation and typical proportions in such a recipe, the plausible weight range for the chia seeds is around 18 to 22 grams.

Considering the porous texture of bread and the size of each slice, a typical slice of this kind weighs approximately between 45 and 65 grams. The two slices look similar in size and thickness, confirming this range is reasonable. Since 'pain' refers to bread here, and the question is about one slice, I estimate one slice weighs about 55 grams, near the midpoint of the range. This aligns with realistic portion sizes for artisanal bread slices in Switzerland and looks appropriate relative to the plate and spread."
8japfq,hummous,42.0,36.0,6.0,0.03049370764762827,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/0bd218b2-a4c6-4605-8737-2055d3040f25,"Let's work this out carefully to estimate the weight of the hummous. The hummous is the beige spread located on the bottom left side of the plate. It occupies a modest area about 4-5 cm wide and around 2-3 cm thick, with a typical dense consistency. Using the size of other food items as reference—a dozen cherry tomatoes of about 2-3 cm length each, olives around 2-3 cm each, and two small bread rolls for scale—the hummous portion appears to be a dollop roughly equivalent to a heaping tablespoon. Typical density of hummous is about 0.9 g/ml. Estimating the hummous volume visually as approximately 30-50 ml, the weight would range between 27 g and 45 g. Taking the midpoint near 36 g seems plausible given the optical volume and density. This estimate fits the plate composition and visible portion size well."

The size is consistent with a standard medium-sized egg, about 5-6 cm in length and typical thickness. Eggs usually weigh between 50-60 grams whole. Since the two halves are shown, and no part seems missing, the total weight of the œuf dur is likely in that standard range. Accounting for slight water loss from boiling, the weight range could be roughly 52-58 grams. A midpoint estimate near 55 grams is reasonable and plausible given the visual evidence and standard egg weights in Switzerland."

The plate contains a mixed salad with rice, cherry tomatoes, peach pieces, corn, asparagus, tuna, red kidney beans, and a halved boiled egg (oeuf). The egg is clearly visible on the upper right side of the plate. It appears to be a medium-boiled egg cut in half, with the yolk solid but slightly moist. A typical medium chicken egg weighs around 50 grams whole. Since only half of the egg is visible, its weight should be approximately half of that, around 25 grams. Considering possible slight moisture loss from boiling but no visible damage or missing parts, the reasonable weight range would be 23–27 grams. I estimate the egg portion in the image to weigh near the midpoint, about 25 grams."

The specified item is 'beurre' (butter), which is spread thinly underneath a layer of apricot jam on a single slice of tresse (braided bread). The slice size appears standard, approximately 10 cm long and 7 cm wide, with a typical thickness of around 1.5 cm. Considering the butter spread, it covers less than half the surface and is quite thin, approximately 1 to 2 mm thick. Butter has a density around 0.9 g/ml, so a thin layer on a slice of this size is generally lightweight. Estimating spread volume roughly as 10 cm x 5 cm (area covered) x 0.15 cm (average thickness) gives 7.5 cm3, equivalent to about 6.75 grams. Adjusting for uneven spread and visible density, a plausible range is 5 to 9 grams. Choosing a value near the midpoint gives about 7 grams. This seems plausible given the visible amount and typical butter spread on bread."

There are about seven raspberries, each of which appears fairly fresh and plump with typical size around 2-3 cm. Individual raspberries generally weigh between 4 and 6 grams depending on size and density. Given their average size and appearance here, a reasonable weight range for one raspberry is 4-6 grams. Multiplying 7 raspberries by this range gives a total of 28 to 42 grams. The raspberries appear fully intact and not crushed, so no adjustment for damage is needed. I therefore estimate the total weight of the framboises to be about 35 grams, which is near the midpoint of the plausible range and coherent with their visible size and count."

The biscuit is visible on the top of the glass cup, broken into pieces and used as a topping. Given the size relative to the ice cream scoops and the iconic tall glass, the biscuit fragments represent roughly one small thin biscuit, similar to a wafer or light cookie. Such biscuits commonly weigh between 8 and 15 grams as a whole. Given the thinness and size visible here, the plausible weight range would be 9-13 grams, with the final estimate near the midpoint. Therefore, the biscuit's estimated weight is approximately 11 grams."

The épinards frais (fresh spinach) are clearly visible as the base of the salad in the white square bowl. The spinach leaves appear fresh, dense, and medium-sized, filling roughly three-quarters of the bowl's bottom. Given the bowl size relative to the tomatoes and falafels, it is approximately 18 cm wide, and the spinach layer depth is about 1-2 cm on average but not a compact pile due to leaf structure and volume. Considering spinach is a low-density leafy vegetable but the volume here is moderate, a reasonable weight range is 40-70 grams. The midpoint estimate, accounting for leaf size and volume visible, is about 55 grams. This is plausible and consistent with a fresh spinach salad base for a meal portion in Switzerland."

The specified item is 'pain' (bread). The image shows a single slice of brown bread on a plate beside two pieces of omelette aux tomates. The bread slice covers a significant portion of the plate and appears to be a typical sliced piece of rustic or whole wheat bread. A standard slice of this type of bread in Switzerland typically weighs between 40 and 60 grams depending on thickness and density. The visible slice is about average thickness with normal density. Therefore, the plausible weight range is 40-60 grams, with a reasonable midpoint estimate of 50 grams. This fits well with the visible size and thickness relative to the plate's dimensions."

The specified item is 'pain' (bread), visible as one slice placed on a white plate. The slice appears to be a typical small to medium slice of white or country bread, roughly 10 cm by 8 cm in size with moderate thickness. Bread density typically ranges from about 250 to 300 grams per 1000 cubic centimeters. Given the thickness and the size, the slice visually approximates to about 30 to 40 grams. Considering the size and typical weight of a slice of this bread type in Switzerland, a plausible range is 30-40 grams, and choosing near the midpoint, I estimate the bread slice weighs about 35 grams."

The specified item is 'beurre' (butter) on slices of bread. The image shows two slices of artisanal bread, each with a spread: one with jam and butter, and the other with Nutella and butter. The butter layer is visible as a thin, translucent layer primarily under the jam and Nutella, covering part of the bread surface. Given that these are thin spreads typical of breakfast servings, the amount of butter per slice appears thin but fairly even. Considering typical Swiss breakfast portions and the appearance, the butter amount on each slice is likely between 5 and 10 grams, with a midpoint around 7 grams per slice. Since the question is about 'beurre' in general (probably per slice), a reasonable estimate is 7 grams of butter on one slice. This aligns with typical application amounts in a breakfast context and fits plausibly with the visible layer thickness and coverage without overestimating."

The item to estimate is 'beurre' (butter), which is located at the top right of the plate. The butter portion is a small rectangular pat, about the size of a large thumbnail or slightly bigger. Comparing to the slice of baguette and the size of the cheeses on the plate, the butter portion looks to be roughly 3 cm long, 1.5 cm wide, and 0.8 cm thick roughly. Butter has a density around 0.9 g/cm3, so the volume estimate (3 x 1.5 x 0.8 = 3.6 cm3) corresponds to roughly 3.2-4 grams. To allow for some visual uncertainty (the butter might be slightly thicker or thinner), I consider a plausible weight range of 3-6 grams, with a midpoint near 4.5 grams. This makes sense as a typical portion size for butter served with a small bread and cheese plate. Therefore, the estimated weight of the beurre is 5 grams."

The specific item to estimate is 'demi croissant.' The image shows a small piece of a croissant, clearly buttered and topped with apricot jam. A standard whole croissant weighs around 50-60 grams, so a half croissant would be approximately 25-30 grams in a full portion. However, this is only a small portion of half a croissant, roughly about a quarter of a full croissant or even slightly less, visibly around 1/4 of a whole. Based on the visible size relative to the plate and butter and jam thickness, I estimate this portion to weigh between 12-18 grams for the croissant itself including the butter and jam spread. Choosing a midpoint, my estimate is 15 grams."

The right side contains the flocon d'avoines (oat flakes). Visually, the oat flakes occupy a small to medium pile, approximately half the bowl's base area with a thin layer. Considering the size of the bowl relative to the oat flakes, the volume is roughly 30-40 ml. Dried oat flakes have a density approximately 0.35-0.45 g/ml. Thus, the weight range is estimated between 10 grams (lower volume or less dense) and 18 grams (higher volume or denser). Choosing a midpoint for accuracy, I estimate the oat flakes weight at about 14 grams."

The 'huile de lin' (linseed oil) is not directly visible as a separate liquid portion in the bowl. There is no visible oil pool or distinct oily shine on the food surfaces. Since linseed oil is typically served in small amounts as a drizzle or dressing, and no container or bottle is visible, it is most likely that only a small quantity is present, absorbed or mixed with the other ingredients. Given the surrounding foods and typical portion sizes for linseed oil as a dressing, the amount is plausibly between 5–10 grams. Choosing a midpoint to reflect a moderate amount added in a meal, I estimate approximately 7 grams of linseed oil on this plate."

The tomme fleurette is visually identified as the cheese piece near the bottom center-right of the plate, with a creamy pale interior and a thin white rind. Compared to the other cheese pieces and the slice of baguette, it appears as a small triangular portion roughly 4 cm long, 2.5 cm wide at the base, and about 1.5 cm thick. Tomme fleurette is moderately dense cheese, similar in texture to soft to semi-soft cheeses. Estimating its volume gives roughly 15 cm³. With a typical density of soft cheeses around 0.9-1.1 g/cm³, the weight range is approximately 13.5 to 16.5 grams. Midpoint near 15 grams is reasonable. This estimate matches the size relative to the baguette slice and the other cheese pieces on the plate."
