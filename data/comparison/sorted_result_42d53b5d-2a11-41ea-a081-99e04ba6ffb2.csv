The image shows a tomato salad with sliced tomatoes, sprinkled with flax seeds and chopped fresh herbs. The tomatoes appear fresh and are cut into wedges or slices, covering a medium-sized plate. Given the visual volume and typical portion sizes for a tomato salad served as a side dish, I estimate the total tomato portion weighs around 200 grams. The flax seeds sprinkled on top seem to be about 10-15 grams, but since only the tomato weight is requested, I'll focus on that. Considering the overall presentation and the size of the slices, a reasonable estimate for the tomato portion is approximately 200 grams."

The image shows a small bowl with a few strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries. The strawberries are quite large, likely the size of typical larger strawberries, and each appears to weigh around 20-25 grams based on their size and typical Swiss portion. With three strawberries, the total weight is roughly 60-75 grams. The raspberries are smaller, and there are about six of them, each likely weighing around 3-4 grams, totaling approximately 18-24 grams. The blueberries are grouped together; estimating their size, they seem to weigh around 150-180 grams in total for this group, considering they look like a typical small handful. Adding these estimates, we get approximately 60-75g (strawberries) + 18-24g (raspberries) + 150-180g (blueberries). The total weight of all berries together is therefore around 228-279 grams. Since the question specifies only one food item, I will estimate based on the largest group, which is the blueberries, given the visual bulk and typical serving size. The blueberries in this image appear to be roughly 150-200 grams in weight, considering their spread and the visible amount. This aligns well with a small handful of blueberries, a common serving size in Switzerland."

The image shows a container with three different foods: cooked egg scramble ('œufs brouillés'), roasted eggplant ('aubergine au four'), and another cooked food which appears to be a type of cooked grain or pulse ('épautre cuit'). The roasted eggplant consists of two large, charred halves, which are quite sizeable and take up a good portion of the container. Given their size and typical weight for roasted eggplant halves, each half weighs roughly 150-200 grams. Together, they likely total around 300-400 grams. The cooked egg scramble appears to fill a portion of the container, with a relatively loose and fluffy texture. Based on its appearance and typical portion sizes, I estimate the egg scramble weighs roughly 120-150 grams. The 'épautre cuit' (likely a typo or misreading for 'épeautre cuit' or a similar grain) appears as a small portion, enough to fill less than half of the container's capacity. Considering Swiss portion sizes, this small portion is probably around 80-100 grams. Due to the visual fullness of the roasted eggplant and the size of the egg scramble, the eggplant is clearly the heaviest portion on the plate. In summary, the roasted eggplant likely weighs between 300-400 grams. The most plausible estimate, considering the size and common weight, is around 350 grams."

The image shows three slices of bread ('pain') spread with butter and strawberry jam ('confiture fraise'). Each bread slice appears to be a typical medium-sized slice, not overly thick, and the spreads are applied evenly but not overly thick. Considering the typical Swiss portion size for a slice of bread, a standard slice usually weighs around 30-40 grams. Since the slices look average, I estimate each at approximately 35 grams. The spreads, butter and jam, are thin layers; their weights are small compared to the bread. Given the quantity visible, I will focus only on the bread's weight as requested, and not add the condiments explicitly, but acknowledge the total weight including spreads would increase slightly. Therefore, I estimate the weight of one slice of bread to be around 35 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread with some spread on each. The first slice has a small amount of beurre (butter) and possibly melasse (molasses), while the second slice has some confiture (jam). The slices appear to be of typical size, roughly 5-6 cm wide and 2-3 cm thick, which corresponds to a standard bread slice weighing around 30-40 grams. The spreads on each are very thin, just a light coating, so their contribution to weight is minimal. Given the visual size and the typical Swiss portion size for bread slices, I estimate each slice of bread to weigh around 35 grams. The spreads are very thin and amount to only a few grams each, so they do not significantly increase the weight. Therefore, the total estimated weight of the bread slices with their spreads is approximately 70 grams, with a plausible range of 65-75 grams considering slight variations in bread thickness or spread amount."

The plate includes several food components: bread (pains provençales et blanc), chicken drumsticks (pillons de poulet), a salad with lettuce, carrots, and vinaigrette, and a salad with tomato, mozzarella, and cucumber. The bread appears to be two slices of a standard baguette, which typically weigh around 50 grams each, so approximately 100 grams total. The chicken drumsticks look cooked, with visible size and meat quantity consistent with approximately 150-180 grams of meat in total, given the size and typical Swiss portioning. The salads, considering the volume and typical serving sizes, seem to be around 200-250 grams for the leafy and vegetable parts combined, but since they are mostly light and leafy/vegetable matter, the actual weight should be at the lower end of that range; roughly 200 grams. The specific item in question is 'pillons de poulet' (chicken drumsticks). Judging by the visual size, volume, and typical portion sizes for this portion of cooked poultry, I estimate the weight to be about 150 grams. The drumsticks are sizeable but not very large, fitting well within Swiss portions for chicken in a mixed meal. This estimate aligns with common portion sizes and the visual cues of the image."

The image shows a container with several pieces of pear, likely cut from one or two whole pears. The pieces are irregular in size, but overall they appear to be medium to large chunks, roughly consistent with half or more of a full pear. Considering the typical size of a pear and the visible amount, I estimate that the total weight of all the pieces together is approximately 140 grams. Since the pieces could represent about half of a medium-sized pear, and a medium pear generally weighs around 150-180 grams in Switzerland, my estimate falls within a plausible range. Based on this visual assessment, I will estimate the weight of the pear as 150 grams."

The bread appears to be a typical-sized baguette slice, which generally weighs around 40-50 grams. The cheeses are various, with the pieces appearing to be moderate in size—mostly small to medium cuts, which in Swiss portions would typically range from about 20 to 50 grams per piece depending on type and size. The tomme fleurette appears to be a small to medium wedge, likely around 30-50 grams. The other cheese pieces vary but are roughly similar in size, averaging about 20-40 grams each. The smoked salmon is a rolled piece about the size of a small hand, which would be roughly 20-30 grams, considering its size and density. The butter slice looks to be about 10 grams based on visual comparison with the cheese pieces. Given the distribution of the items and typical portion sizes, I estimate: the baguette slice at around 45 grams, the cheeses combined with several smaller pieces totaling roughly 200 grams, the smoked salmon at about 25 grams, and the butter at about 10 grams. My final estimate for the total visible food (excluding the plate and background) is approximately 285 grams, with a plausible range of 250-330 grams, and I will select a midpoint estimate of 290 grams for the total food content visible."

The falafel balls are quite numerous, filling a significant part of the bowl but are known to be dense and weigh around 35-45 grams each on average. Given that there are approximately 10 falafel balls, their total weight is likely around 350-450 grams. The other components (spinach, sprouts, tomatoes) are lighter: spinach and sprouts together probably weigh around 30-50 grams. Tomatoes, being small, may total around 40-50 grams. Taking into account the density and visual size, I estimate the total weight of the falafel to be near the middle of its range, say around 400 grams, which is a reasonable sum for this amount and appearance in a typical meal portion."

Based on the visual size and typical Swiss portion sizes, the rice (which dominates the dish) is likely around 150 grams. The cherry tomatoes, corn, and asparagus are small quantities; the beans and tuna are visible but not piled high. The egg, being half, looks like a medium-sized egg, roughly 50 grams whole. The overall portion suggests the egg contributes about 50 grams. The total weight of the egg itself (whole egg) is around 50-55 grams, so estimating half is about 25 grams. The salad sauce and small vegetables are minor contributors, probably around 15 grams. Combining these, I estimate the weight of the egg (oeuf) to be approximately 50 grams, considering it appears to be a whole medium-sized egg."

The image shows a small piece of a half croissant with some butter and apricot jam. The visible portion of the croissant appears to be about one quarter to one third of a typical croissant, which in full size usually weighs around 50-60 grams. Since it is only half a croissant, and considering Swiss portion sizes, I estimate the entire croissant to weigh approximately 50 grams, making this half about 25 grams. The small piece and minimal visible jam and butter suggest a light spread, so the actual added weight from toppings is negligible. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the half croissant to be around 25 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread with toppings. The top tartine has strawberry jam (confiture fraise) and a small amount of butter, while the bottom tartine has molasses (mélasse) and butter. Each slice appears to be a typical piece of rustic or whole-grain bread, roughly 10-12 cm long, about 1.5-2 cm thick, and with moderate surface coverage of the toppings. Based on visual cues, these slices are consistent with standard Swiss slice sizes, which generally weigh around 40-50 grams for similar bread slices. The spread amounts seem to be about a teaspoon each (roughly 4-5 grams of butter + 10 grams of jam or molasses). Given the bread size and spreads, I estimate each tartine's total weight around 50 grams. Since the question focuses on the tartine with molasses and butter, I will estimate that specific piece, which appears slightly smaller due to the spread density, at approximately 48 grams. This takes into account the visible bread size and the relatively thin spreads, which do not add significant weight beyond the bread itself."

Based on its size, thickness, and typical weight for such a slice, I estimate the bread weighs around 30 grams. This estimate aligns with common Swiss portion sizes for a single slice of bread of this thickness and diameter. The butter and spread seem to be applied in moderate quantities, not enough to significantly increase the weight of the bread, so the total weight remains close to the bread's weight.

Given that the pasta is somewhat piled but not overfilled, I estimate the cooked pasta weight to be around 140 grams. The green beans are in a smaller section, and their volume suggests a light portion, likely around 100 grams, considering their density. The grilled chicken pieces are relatively thin and small, with negligible bone weight visible, and appear to be two small to medium-sized pieces, estimating around 80 grams, which aligns with usual Swiss portion sizes for cooked chicken. The grated Parmesan scattered on top is a small topping, likely under 10 grams, so I will not specifically estimate this separately as it is a minor component.

Visually, the pasta appears to occupy a substantial portion of the plate, with a volume typical of a Swiss portion, roughly around 150-200 grams, considering its volume and density. The green beans are piled but not overly dense, suggesting around 100 grams. The kidney beans look a bit less dense but are generous in quantity, approximately 80 grams. The mozzarella is a dollop, roughly 50 grams based on its appearance and typical serving size. The oil is unlikely to add significant weight but is likely a light drizzle, so it is ignored for weight estimation. The pasta seems to be the main component; the beans and mozzarella are smaller portions. Combining these observations and comparing to typical Swiss portion sizes, I estimate the pasta at about 160 grams, the haricots verts at about 100 grams, the haricots rouges at about 80 grams, and mozzarella at about 50 grams. The target food item is mozzarella. Given its size and appearance relative to the other items, I estimate the mozzarella to weigh approximately 50 grams."
m4egh2,biscuit,8.0,12.0,4.0,0.005938021896455743,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/5350f0cd-e92a-44fc-9770-13b4bcca327e,"Let's work this out in a step-by-step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a tall glass filled with various dessert components: scoops of ice cream, a meringue, slices of kiwi fruit, and a biscuit on top. The ice cream appears to be in the form of three scoops, which in Swiss portions typically weigh around 60-80 grams each, but since these are likely small ice cream scoops in this dessert, I estimate approximately 50 grams per scoop for a total of about 150 grams. The meringue is small and airy, probably around 15-20 grams based on its size and density. The kiwi slices are thin and appear to be from just one kiwi, which would be about 50 grams for the whole fruit, with a portion visible here likely around 20 grams. The biscuit looks like a small cookie, roughly 10-15 grams based on visual size and typical biscuit weight. Given these observations, I will estimate the total weight of the components as follows: ice cream 150g, meringue 20g, kiwi 20g, biscuit 15g. The total is approximately 205 grams. I will express the estimate for the biscuit alone, which appears small but proportionate in size, around 12 grams, slightly below the estimate range but reasonable considering the context."
p96w4a,pain,49.0,45.0,4.0,0.036370384115791424,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/b0979eb7-5126-4d9e-9058-64093ecde7e0,"Let's work this out in a step-by-step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two slices of bread ('pain') with different spreads: one with butter and Nutella, the other with butter, melasse, and additional butter. For the bread itself, assuming it is standard Swiss bread slice, the typical weight is around 30-40 grams per slice, considering they are of normal thickness. Both slices appear to be of average size and thickness. The spreads, based on visual inspection, appear to be moderate in quantity – not thickly piled but enough to cover each slice lightly. For the Nutella, a typical spread on a slice of this size is around 10-15 grams. For the butter and melasse, similarly, about 5-10 grams per slice. The total for each slice, including the bread and spreads, would therefore be approximately 40-55 grams. Given the visible thickness and spreads, I estimate each slice of bread with its toppings to weigh around 45 grams, for a total of roughly 90 grams for both slices."
wrah5h,pain,51.0,55.0,4.0,0.03785488958990536,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/69327bb9-2361-4486-bea2-300691e60d0a,"Let's work this out in a step-by-step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a piece of bread (pain) topped with aubergine caviar (caviar d'aubergines). The bread appears to be a slice from a standard baguette or similar loaf, roughly 10-12 cm long, with a thickness of about 1.5-2 cm. It looks like a typical slice size in a French-style meal. Swiss portions for bread slices like this are usually around 50 grams per slice, especially if it's a standard baguette slice. The topping of aubergine caviar covers the entire surface with some slight thickness but not excessively piled up, suggesting a modest spread. Based on visual judgment, I estimate the bread itself weighs approximately 55 grams, and most of the visual volume is from the bread rather than the topping. Since the spread is thin and spread evenly, the topping's weight is likely around 20 grams. To focus on estimating the weight of the bread (pain), I would assign a value near the typical portion size. Considering all factors, I estimate the slice of bread weighs about 55 grams."
p96w4a,salami,15.0,12.0,3.0,0.00835034329189089,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/ea5f58cc-2c17-4ecc-ad47-54141658e911,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a slice of bread topped with ham, which appears to be a typical Swiss portion size, likely around 50 grams considering the thickness and surface area. The salami on the side appears in small, stacked slices, which typically weigh about 2-3 grams per slice; estimating approximately 5 slices gives around 10-15 grams total. The cherry tomatoes are small, about 20-25 grams each. Given they look full-sized and round, I estimate around 40 grams for both. The other items (butter, onion, crème balsamique, radis) are less relevant for this estimate since only salami is targeted. Based on these visual cues and typical portion sizes, I estimate the salami to be roughly 12 grams, which aligns with a small serving in line with Swiss portion sizes."
2ahgvr,graine de chia,6.0,5.0,1.0,0.001113379105585452,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/cca1db77-eb8e-454d-8ea2-e23840f01b97,"Let's work this out in a step-by-step way to be sure we have the right answer. The item in question is 'graine de chia' within a mixture that includes yogurt, oats, oat bran, honey, and almond puree. The mixture is contained in a jar, filling most of it, which suggests a typical portion size for a breakfast or snack. Given the context and the contents, the visible amount of chia seeds is likely to be about a small sprinkling or a tablespoon at most. Chia seeds are tiny and weigh about 1 gram per teaspoon. Considering the mixture visually, the chia seeds seem evenly dispersed but only constitute a small fraction of the total weight. Since the whole mixture probably weighs around 300-350 grams (to be consistent with typical portions for yogurt bowls with grains and toppings), and chia seeds generally make up a small percentage, I estimate the chia seeds portion to be around 5 grams, which corresponds roughly to 1 to 1.5 teaspoons. This seems plausible given the visual density and typical usage of chia seeds in such preparations."
m4egh2,beurre,4.0,5.0,1.0,0.0007422527370569679,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/1f732396-f9f9-451f-bb51-ade259131e78,"Let's work this out in a step-by-step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with slices of bread topped with jam, along with a handful of raspberries, blueberries, and some blackberries. The slices of bread are roughly triangular with a size indicating they are small to medium-sized; considering Swiss bread slices, they typically weigh around 30-40g each. The jam on each slice appears to cover about half of the surface and is of moderate thickness. I estimate each jam portion to be around 10-15 grams, consistent with typical spread amounts. The fruits are common small berries; the raspberry portion looks like about 10 berries (~60-70g), and the blueberries appear to total approximately 40-50g, based on their size and quantity. The blackberries on the left are about 8-10 berries (~50g). The butter isn't visible separately, but considering typical spreads, a small pat of about 5g might be applied on each bread slice, summing to approximately 20g total, although it is not explicitly visible. Since the question asks specifically for the butter, and no distinct butter portion is visible in the image, the plausible estimate of the butter used here would be around 5 grams, as a small spread on each of the four slices. This size is consistent with typical portion sizes for butter when spreading on bread. Therefore, I estimate the butter involved in this meal to be around 5 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread, each with a spread: one with butter (beurre) and the other with Nutella (pâte à tartiner). The slices appear to be standard-sized, likely from a typical loaf, and are moderately thick. Swiss bread slices typically weigh around 30-40 grams each. The butter spread looks like a thin layer, which would be roughly 5-7 grams per slice, consistent with a light buttering. The Nutella spread appears to cover most of the slice with a relatively thick layer — I estimate about 10-15 grams for that slice, considering an even spread over a standard slice. Since bread slices are approximately 30-40 grams, these spreads are proportionate. Based on visual cues and typical portion sizes, my estimate for the butter (beurre) on the slice is around 6 grams."

The image shows a small portion of rolled oats (flocon d'avoines) in a bowl. Based on visual assessment, the amount appears to be roughly a heaping teaspoon or slightly more. For oats, a common tablespoon (roughly 15 grams) corresponds with about a heaping tablespoon for a normal serving, but since this is a small pile, it looks slightly less than that. Considering the visual volume and typical weight of oats, I estimate this portion to be around 12 grams. Given the small and somewhat heaped appearance, the estimated weight range could be from 10 to 15 grams, with a midpoint estimate around 12 grams."

The image shows a single Kinder chocolate bar, which appears to be the standard Kinder Bueno, given its shape, size, and the characteristic white and brown pattern. Based on known data, a typical Kinder Bueno bar weighs approximately 21.5 grams. The visual size of the bar in relation to the wooden surface suggests it is a full standard-sized chocolate bar, matching the expected dimensions and appearance for this product. Since no other context or additional bars are visible, I estimate the weight of this single Kinder chocolate bar at around 21.5 grams, which aligns with standard packaging and portion sizes."
