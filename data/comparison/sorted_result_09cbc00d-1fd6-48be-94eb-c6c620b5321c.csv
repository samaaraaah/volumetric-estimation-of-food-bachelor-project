The courgette et oignons are located on the left side of the container. The mixture appears to be cooked and consists of chopped courgettes and onions. Based on the size of the container and the visible volume of the courgette et oignons, it seems to occupy about half of the container's depth. Cooked courgettes and onions are relatively low in density. Considering the visible portion and the typical weight of such a mixture, I estimate the weight of the courgette et oignons to be approximately 150 grams."

The image shows a pizza with visible toppings of mushrooms (champignons), olives, and zucchini (courgettes). The pizza is partially eaten, with five slices visible on the plate. The toppings are distributed across the slices, and the pizza crust appears thin. Based on the size of the slices and the visible toppings, I estimate the total weight of the pizza to be approximately 400-450 grams. Since the pizza is partially eaten, I estimate the remaining portion to be about 70% of the original pizza. This means the remaining pizza weighs approximately 280-315 grams. Considering the toppings and the thin crust, I estimate the weight of the specified food item, 'pizza champignons, olives, courgettes,' to be 300 grams."

The specified food item is 'carotte,' which is clearly visible on the left side of the plate. The carrots are sliced into thick rounds, and their bright orange color suggests they are cooked. Based on the size and number of slices, the portion appears to be from one medium-sized carrot. A medium cooked carrot typically weighs around 60-80 grams. Considering the visible volume and density of the slices, I estimate the weight of the carrots to be approximately 70 grams."

The tomatoes are visible in the middle section of the container, cut into medium-sized pieces. They occupy approximately one-third of the container's surface area. Based on the size of the container and the visible volume of the tomatoes, I estimate that the total weight of the tomatoes is around 120 grams. This accounts for the fact that tomatoes are relatively dense and the pieces are not overly thin or small."

The specified food item is 'pillons de poulet' (chicken drumsticks). In the image, there are five small chicken drumsticks visible on the plate. These drumsticks appear to be cooked and seasoned, with some charred areas indicating grilling or roasting. Based on their size, they are relatively small drumsticks, likely from a smaller chicken. Each drumstick is estimated to weigh approximately 30-40 grams after cooking, as cooking reduces the weight due to water loss. Multiplying this by five drumsticks, the total weight is approximately 150-200 grams. To remain precise and conservative, I estimate the total weight of the drumsticks to be 180 grams."

The image shows a jar containing a mixture of ingredients, including visible chia seeds distributed throughout the yogurt-based mixture. Chia seeds are small and dense, and their weight is significant relative to their volume. Based on the distribution of chia seeds in the jar, they appear to make up a small but noticeable proportion of the mixture, likely around 10-15% of the total volume. The jar seems to hold approximately 250-300 grams of the mixture in total. Assuming chia seeds make up about 12% of the mixture, the weight of the chia seeds would be approximately 30-36 grams. Adjusting for the density and visual distribution, I estimate the weight of the chia seeds to be 35 grams."

The specified food item is 'épinards frais' (fresh spinach). In the image, the spinach is spread across the bottom of the bowl and forms the base of the salad. The leaves are fresh, raw, and not tightly packed, which means they have a low density. Based on the visible volume of spinach in the bowl, it appears to be approximately 2-3 handfuls of loose leaves. A typical handful of fresh spinach weighs around 20-30 grams. Given the amount visible, I estimate the total weight of the spinach to be around 60 grams."

The image shows a single waffle (gaufre) on a plate. The waffle appears to be a standard size, approximately 10 cm x 10 cm, and is of typical thickness for a waffle. Waffles are generally light and airy, with a density that suggests a weight of around 50-60 grams for this size. Based on the visual cues and the standard weight of a waffle of this size, I estimate the weight of the gaufre to be 55 grams."

The specified food item is 'tartine mélasse + beurre,' which is the slice of bread with molasses and butter visible in the lower part of the image. The bread appears to be a medium-thick slice of rustic bread, and the molasses and butter are spread thinly across the surface. Based on the size of the slice (approximately 10-12 cm long and 5-6 cm wide) and the density of the bread, I estimate the bread itself to weigh around 40 grams. The butter and molasses together appear to add a thin layer, likely contributing an additional 5 grams. Therefore, the total weight of the 'tartine mélasse + beurre' is approximately 45 grams."

The image shows a bowl containing a creamy mixture with visible chia seeds. The food list includes 'séré maigre' (low-fat quark), 'graines de chia' (chia seeds), and 'purée de noisettes' (hazelnut puree). The dominant component in the bowl appears to be the 'séré maigre,' as it forms the base of the mixture. The chia seeds are dispersed throughout, and the hazelnut puree is likely mixed in, giving the mixture its slightly beige color. Based on the bowl's size and the volume of the mixture, I estimate that the amount of 'séré maigre' used is approximately 150 grams, as it is the primary ingredient and quark is dense but light in weight."
