The image shows a plastic container filled about halfway with a Greek salad (salade grecque) consisting of diced cucumber, tomato, yellow pepper, onion rings, olives, and feta cheese pieces, all mixed with a salad dressing. The salad is evenly diced into small pieces and occupies a moderate volume. Given the container size appears to be approximately 15 cm by 10 cm by about 7-8 cm high, and the filling reaches a little less than half the height, the volume is roughly 500 ml or less, though salad density is low because of air gaps and watery vegetables. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes for mixed vegetable salads are around 150-175 grams, and this looks like a small-to-medium portion in a container, I estimate the salad to weigh between 130 and 160 grams. Choosing a reasonable midpoint, I estimate the weight of the salade grecque here to be approximately 145 grams."

The image shows a plate of tomato salad (salade de tomates) with tomato slices spread across a medium-sized plate. Each slice appears thick and fresh, roughly the size of half a palm. The tomato pieces roughly correspond to the content of about 2 medium tomatoes. A medium tomato typically weighs around 120-150 grams. Considering that this is a Swiss portion and that the tomatoes are cut into thick wedges, the total weight of the tomatoes on the plate is likely between 220 and 280 grams. Taking the midpoint based on the visual volume and typical Swiss portion, the estimate is about 250 grams. This fits the visual fullness of the plate and the collective volume of slices seen, without overestimation."

The image shows a cardboard container filled with cherry tomatoes (tomates cerises), mostly red with some orange ones. There are about 20 tomatoes visible, clustered on stems. Each cherry tomato typically weighs between 15-20 grams according to Swiss portion references. Considering the size and quantity, the total weight would be approximately between 300 grams (20 x 15g) and 400 grams (20 x 20g). The tomatoes look medium-sized and fairly uniform in size, so a good midpoint estimate would be around 350 grams. This estimate aligns well with typical portion sizes and the volume observed in the container."

The courgette et oignons (zucchini and onions) are located on the left side of the glass container. The portion appears to be diced and cooked with some herbs, occupying roughly half of the container's area. The pieces are moderate in size and moderately dense. Comparing the volume to the whole container and to the millet patties on the right, the zucchini and onion mix looks like about one medium-sized serving of cooked vegetables. Following Swiss portion size references, cooked vegetables typically weigh in the range of 150-175 grams per serving. Given the visible density and spread, a reasonable weight estimate falls near the midpoint of this range. I estimate the weight of the courgette et oignons to be about 160 grams."

The image shows a small bowl filled with whole blueberries ('myrtilles'). Blueberries typically weigh about 1-2 grams each. The bowl appears to hold roughly 50 to 60 blueberries based on volume and approximation of the visible count. Considering that, the total weight for this bowl of blueberries would reasonably fall between 50 and 90 grams. Taking a midpoint to be accurate and consistent with Swiss portion sizes for berries, around 70 grams is a plausible estimate for the quantity of blueberries in the bowl."

The salade (salad) is on the left side of the plate and consists mainly of leafy greens with some sunflower seeds sprinkled on top. The portion is moderately sized, not heaped but covering about one third of the plate's surface area. Considering Swiss portion size for cooked vegetables or salad greens typically ranges around 150-175g per serving, and that leafy greens have low density, the visual volume corresponds well with the lower to mid part of that range. Given the salad is fresh and not densely packed, I estimate the weight of this salad portion to be between 120g and 160g. Choosing a value near the midpoint, the estimated weight for this salade is about 140 grams."

The image shows several pieces of pear (poire) placed inside a small plastic container. The pieces vary in size but collectively correspond roughly to about half a medium-sized pear. A typical medium pear weighs around 150-170 grams, so half of that would be approximately 75-85 grams. Considering the size and volume of the pieces visible, and the fact that the pear appears fresh with skin on, the total weight is likely in this range. I estimate a weight range of 70-90 grams for these pear pieces, and I choose a midpoint of about 80 grams as the best estimate."

The image shows a small green bowl containing three medium to large strawberries with their green caps. Based on their size relative to the bowl and the typical weight of a medium-large strawberry in Switzerland (approximately 15-20 grams each), and given there are three strawberries, the total weight likely ranges between 45 and 60 grams. Estimating near the midpoint accounting for some variation in size, I conclude the weight of the strawberries is about 53 grams."

The asparagus ('asperges') is clearly visible on the plate, with about 7 spears arranged next to the ham. The asparagus spears appear to be cooked and are of medium thickness and length, typical for a Swiss serving. A standard Swiss portion of cooked asparagus is around 150-175 grams. Given that these spears are fairly uniform, not overly piled up, and occupy about a quarter of the plate, an estimated weight range of 150-175 grams seems appropriate. Choosing the midpoint for precision, I estimate the asparagus weight as approximately 162 grams, consistent with visual volume and typical Swiss portion sizes."

The image shows a small plate with a modest portion of salad greens ('salade verte'), two boiled eggs ('oeufs'), cucumber slices ('concombre'), and small cubes of maréchal cheese. Maréchal is a semi-hard cheese, dense and relatively heavy for its volume. There are about five small cubes of maréchal cheese visible on the plate. Each cube looks roughly 1.5-2cm per side. A 2cm cube of semi-hard cheese weighs approximately 20-25 grams. Since these cubes are relatively small and there are five pieces, a reasonable weight range is about 80-120 grams. Given the visible size and number of cubes, I estimate the total maréchal cheese portion to be about 100 grams, which aligns well with a typical Swiss cheese portion size served in salads."

The croissants au jambon are two small pastry croissants, visible at the top left of the plate. Each croissant appears to be a smaller Swiss-style portion, typical for breakfast or a light meal. Considering that a standard small croissant weighs around 40-50 grams, and adding the ham inside, each croissant au jambon could weigh slightly more, roughly 55-65 grams. For two croissants, this suggests a weight range of approximately 110-130 grams. Given the size and visible volume, I estimate the total weight of the two croissants au jambon together at about 120 grams. This estimation aligns well with typical Swiss portion sizes for such items and matches the visual appearance on the plate relative to the other food items."
ppf8hc,spaghetti,217.0,135.0,82.0,2.162878327458369,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/7c7d7932-0ffe-47e1-83e9-2289044511e5,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a black bowl with spaghetti topped with some pesto and sprinkled with gruyère. The spaghetti are cooked and form a moderately sized portion, typical for a single Swiss serving. Swiss portion sizes for cooked pasta generally range from 120 to 150 grams. Considering the volume of spaghetti visible, which is not heaped excessively but enough to fill the bowl moderately, it fits well within this typical serving range. There are no unusually large or small portions visible, and the presence of pesto and cheese does not impact the pasta weight itself. Therefore, I estimate the spaghetti weight to be roughly the midpoint of the typical Swiss portion size range, approximately 135 grams."

The image shows a single red apple (pomme) placed on a flat surface. The apple appears to be of medium size, roughly the diameter of a typical apple around 7-8 cm. Considering standard Swiss portion sizes for an apple, and visually comparing the apple to the surface texture and shadows which suggest a typical medium size, the weight is likely to be in the range of 150-200 grams. Since the apple looks neither very small nor large, the midpoint of this range around 175 grams is a reasonable estimate for the weight of this apple."

The tiramisu is the left dessert portion on the plate, characterized by creamy layers and dusted cocoa powder on top. It occupies a moderate volume, similar in size to the portion of forêt noir next to it. Given typical Swiss serving sizes for cream-based desserts like tiramisu, which tend to be smaller than North American portions, and considering the visible depth and density of this slice, a reasonable weight range would be 120-160 grams. The midpoint estimate is about 140 grams, which fits with the portion size visible and typical dessert serving sizes in Switzerland. This estimate also aligns with the portion of forêt noir, which appears slightly denser but similar in size."

The myrtilles (blueberries) are clearly visible mixed into the bowl of cereal and yogurt. There appear to be about 15-20 blueberries scattered throughout the mixture. Blueberries typically weigh around 15-20 grams each, but this Swiss portion size usually aligns closer to the lower end since portions are smaller. Assuming an average of about 16 grams per 10 blueberries, 15-20 blueberries would weigh roughly 24-32 grams total. Considering some may be partially hidden or embedded, a plausible range would be about 20-35 grams. The mixture surrounding the berries is quite voluminous, but the density and visual count guide this estimation. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the blueberries to be approximately 28 grams."

The image shows a small remaining portion of pasta salad ('salade de pâtes') on a plate. The pasta are penne, mixed with a few corn kernels and cherry tomato halves, with some herbs. The remaining portion looks like about a third or less of a usual Swiss serving of pasta salad. Swiss typical pasta serving is about 120-150g cooked. Here, the portion is clearly small, roughly 40-50g based on volume. Considering the density of cooked pasta and added vegetables, a plausible weight range for this leftover portion is 35-55g. The midpoint and most reasonable estimate is about 45g."

The viande (meat) on the plate appears as a single cooked hamburger patty or similar minced meat piece. It is roughly rectangular but with an irregular shape, around the size of a palm, which is common for a typical single Swiss portion of meat. Considering Swiss portion sizes for meat are generally between 100-120 grams, and visually this piece is not very thick but dense, the plausible range is between 95 and 120 grams. Given the visible size and thickness compared to the potatoes and the salad, the estimate near the midpoint would be about 110 grams. This estimate aligns well with Swiss portion norms and the visual size relative to common food items nearby."

The image shows two slices of 'pain bis' (brown bread) with visible texture and typical Swiss bread slice thickness and size. The bread appears to be sliced from a dense whole grain loaf, typical in Switzerland, and the slices are of regular sandwich size, about 10-12 cm long and 6-7 cm wide. Swiss bread slice weights commonly range between 40 to 60 grams per slice depending on thickness and density. Given the visible slice thickness and density of the bread in the image, it's appropriate to estimate each slice around 45-55 grams. Since there are two slices visible (one with cheese and cornichons and one with mayonnaise), but the target item is 'pain bis' which includes both slices, the total weight is around 90-110 grams. Choosing the midpoint for better accuracy, I estimate the total weight of the 'pain bis' as 100 grams."

The image shows five chicken drumettes (pillons de poulet) that appear grilled and are neatly arranged on the plate. Each drumette is about the size typical for a single chicken wing drumette portion, which generally weighs between 30 to 40 grams. For five pieces, this suggests a total weight range of 150 to 200 grams. Considering the moderate size of the drumettes and the typical Swiss portion size for meat (100-120g as a standard serving), this portion seems slightly above average but still plausible for a full meal. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the total weight of the 5 chicken drumettes is around 175 grams, which is the midpoint of the plausible range."

The image shows a galette wrap laid flat on a plate with visible sliced tomatoes as part of the filling. There are three tomato wedges visible, each roughly quarter-sized and moderately thick. Tomatoes of this size typically weigh between 25 to 35 grams each. Given the smaller Swiss portion context and visible size, the total tomato weight for these three pieces is likely within the 75-105 grams range. The middle ground estimate close to the midpoint is about 90 grams, which aligns well with typical Swiss serving sizes and is plausible given the visible tomato volume and thickness in the wrap."

The targeted food is 'pomme' (apple), which is clearly visible in the image next to a croissant for scale. The apple is small to medium-sized, typical of Swiss apples, and appears uncut with the skin on. A typical medium Swiss apple weighs between 150-180 grams. This particular apple looks slightly smaller than average but still quite close to medium size. Considering its size relative to the croissant and the typical weight range, a plausible weight range would be 140-170 grams. Choosing near the midpoint for accuracy, I estimate the apple weighs about 155 grams."

The salade de céleri is visible on the bottom right of the plate. It appears as a shredded, slightly creamy white pile of celery root salad. The portion takes a moderate amount of space on the plate but is not piled very high, indicating a relatively light volume. Considering that celery root salad has moderate density and moisture, the portion shown looks like a typical Swiss side salad portion. The portion is smaller than the carrot salad and potato salad on the plate. Given typical Swiss side salad portions range roughly between 100 and 150 grams, with this appearing slightly less than a full serving, an estimated plausible range would be 90-120 grams. Choosing near the midpoint while tending to the slightly modest volume, I estimate the weight at about 105 grams for the salade de céleri."

The image shows a glass container with two distinct food portions: on the left, cooked diced courgette and onions; on the right, six small galettes made of millet, black beans, and corn. Each galette looks roughly shaped, about 5-6 cm in length and about 2-3 cm thick, with visible grains and beans giving substantial density. Considering their size and the grain/legume base, each galette likely weighs around 30-40 grams. With six galettes present, the total weight would be between 180 and 240 grams. Swiss portions for homemade vegetable patties of this type generally fall in this range. A midpoint estimate at 210 grams is reasonable, given the visual volume and compactness compared to the container size and the adjacent vegetables. This estimate excludes the courgette and onion portion and focuses strictly on the galettes."

The salade verte (green salad) is located on the bottom-right portion of the plate, consisting mostly of iceberg or similar lettuce with some creamy dressing. The leaves are relatively loose and not densely packed, covering a moderate area on the plate but fairly thin in depth. Typical Swiss vegetable portions range from 150 to 175 grams for cooked or mixed salads, but since this salade verte is primarily raw lettuce with dressing and limited volume, the portion is smaller. Visually the lettuce covers roughly a quarter of the plate's visible food area, but with low density. Comparing its size to the slice of roast and rice salad nearby helps gauge volume – it is notably less voluminous. Based on this and accounting for dressing weight, I estimate the salad weighs between 60 and 80 grams. The midpoint weighted estimate is approximately 70 grams, which is consistent with Swiss portion sizes and the visible amount on this plate."

The légumes (courgette and onion) with 1 tablespoon of olive oil are visible on the left side of the plate. The cooked vegetables appear to be sliced zucchini and onion, sautéed, spread in a relatively thin layer covering part of the plate. Considering the typical density and moisture content of cooked zucchini and onions, along with the use of a small amount of olive oil, the volume suggests a modest portion size. Swiss portion references for cooked vegetables are about 150-175 grams per serving; the amount here appears slightly less than a full serving given the plate area and thickness. Therefore, I estimate a plausible weight range of 120-150 grams. Taking the midpoint for final estimation, I assign 135 grams to the légumes portion, consistent with visible size, typical Swiss portions, and the food type."

The scrambled eggs ('oeufs brouillés') are located on the upper left side of the plate. They are loosely piled and occupy roughly one third of the plate surface, appearing fluffy and fully cooked. Considering the size of the plate and the proportion of eggs relative to the other foods (gnocchi and cauliflower), this looks like a single Swiss portion of scrambled eggs. A typical Swiss portion of eggs (cooked) weighs around 100-120 grams. Given this portion is neither very small nor excess, and taking into account moisture loss during cooking but also the fluffiness of scrambled eggs, an estimated weight range is 90-110 grams. Centered in this range, a reasonable estimate would be 100 grams. This fits the visual appearance well and matches portion size references for a cooked egg portion in Switzerland."

Considering the density and typical moisture content of cooked carrots and leeks, the vegetables have moderate volume but are less dense than meat or rice. Swiss typical cooked vegetable portions range between 150 and 175 grams. Given the amount visible, which is a moderate serving but not overly piled or deep, an estimated weight range would be 140 to 170 grams. Placing the estimation near the midpoint considering some loss of volume due to cooking, I estimate the sautéed vegetables weigh approximately 155 grams."

Each slice of bread appears to be from a typical Swiss baguette-style loaf, approximately 1 to 1.5 cm thick, and roughly 10-12 cm long. A typical slice of this type of bread weighs around 40-50 grams in Swiss portion sizes. Given there are two slices visible, each weighing approximately 45 grams on average, the total weight of bread on the plate should be close to 90 grams. The volume and thickness appear consistent with this range and there is no visible indication of unusually thick or thin slices. Thus, the plausible weight range is 80-100 grams, and I estimate the total weight of the bread (pain) to be approximately 90 grams."

The galette millet maïs haricots noirs is shown as two small patties in the lower left part of the container. Each galette appears roughly 5-6 cm in diameter and about 1-1.5 cm thick. Considering the ingredients (millet, corn, black beans), these patties are relatively dense but not too heavy due to the grain component. Given the Swiss portion size and typical weight for a similar millet-based patty, one patty usually weighs around 50-70 grams. With two patties visible, the total weight range is about 100-140 grams. An estimate near the midpoint (around 120 grams) is appropriate. This fits well with the volume and visual proportion compared to other food items, particularly the cheese and salad portions."

The galettes millet haricots noirs maïs are the three round patties visible on the plate, composed of millet, black beans, and corn. Each patty appears to be around 2 cm thick and about 7-8 cm in diameter, typical sizes for homemade grain and legume patties. Considering the ingredients (millet, beans, corn) which are dense but not overly heavy, and the portion size relative to the other foods on the plate, each patty likely weighs between 70 and 90 grams. Three such patties combined would weigh roughly 210 to 270 grams. Choosing a value near the midpoint of this range, I estimate the combined weight of the galettes millet haricots noirs maïs to be approximately 240 grams. This estimate aligns well with Swiss moderate portion sizes for grain-based patties and fits the visual volume considering the plate and surrounding items."

The poivron (red bell pepper) is sliced and displayed on the plate in front of the wrap, next to the pieces of chicken. The slices are about 6-7 pieces, each moderately thin. Bell peppers have a relatively low density and weigh less than denser vegetables. Given the visible quantity and typical thickness, the poivron portion appears to be around 70 to 90 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes for cooked or sliced vegetables which are approximately 150-175 grams per serving, and this being roughly half or a bit less of a full serving, an estimate near the middle of 80 grams is reasonable and fits the visible amount."

The food item to estimate is 'pain' (bread), and there are three visible slices of bread on a plate. The slices appear to be from a rustic, seeded loaf, typical of Swiss bread. Each slice looks thick, about 1.5 to 2 cm, with a crunchy crust and a dense crumb inside. Based on typical Swiss bread slice sizes, each slice weighs approximately 40 to 50 grams. Since three slices are visible (including one smaller piece of end crust), the total weight for the three slices would likely be in the range of 110 to 130 grams. The smaller piece on the top right is roughly half a slice, so including that, a reasonable final estimate would be about 120 grams. This is consistent with common portion sizes and the visual volume on the plate."

The avocado is located on the upper part of the wrap, visible as two medium-sized slices. Each slice appears to be about a quarter to a third of a whole avocado. A typical Swiss portion of avocado for one medium slice could be between 40-60 grams, considering Swiss portion sizes are smaller than North American ones. These two slices together roughly correspond to half an avocado. Given that a whole medium avocado weighs approximately 150g, half would be about 75g. Taking into account the visible portion and the moderate thickness of the slices, a plausible range is 65-85g. I estimate the weight of the avocado in this image to be approximately 75 grams, close to the midpoint of the range."

The slice appears to be a standard serving size from a typical tart of about 24-26 cm diameter. The crust thickness and the rhubarb topping are visible, and the rhubarb pieces are chunky but not densely packed. Swiss portion sizes for a fruit tart slice typically range from 120 to 160 grams depending on thickness and topping density. Considering the moderate amount of rhubarb and the visible crust, a plausible range would be 130-150 grams. Choosing a midpoint reflecting a normal slice weight, the estimate is about 140 grams for this slice of rhubarb tart."

The salade de pâtes (pasta salad) is located at the lower-left part of the plate. The portion appears moderate, with pasta spirals mixed with small visible vegetables like tomato and corn. The amount is roughly the volume of a small handful of pasta, not heaped. Considering Swiss portion sizes, cooked pasta servings are typically around 120-150 grams. Since this portion is slightly below a full serving size (as there is also a significant portion of carrot salad and meat on the same plate), it probably weighs a bit less than a full serving. I estimate a minimum-maximum range of 90-120 grams and a midpoint estimate of around 105 grams. This aligns well with the visible volume and the presence of other dishes on the plate, making it a plausible and balanced portion for a meal."

The image shows a single portion of hazelnut ice cream ('glace noisette') in a small bowl. The scoop appears to be a modest size, not a large ball but a medium-sized scoop shaped unevenly. Given the typical density and volume of ice cream and the visual comparison with the bowl size, the portion looks like it weighs between 70 to 90 grams. Considering Swiss portion sizes for ice cream, which tend to be moderate, and the visual cues, an estimated weight near the midpoint of around 80 grams is reasonable. This range fits the volume of the scoop and the common portion size for a single serving of ice cream in Switzerland."

The tomatoes ('tomate') are sliced and occupy roughly one third of the container, placed in the middle section beneath the pieces of mozzarella. The tomato slices are relatively thin and cover a moderate area with some overlapping. Considering a typical Swiss serving size for sliced tomato as a vegetable is around 150-175 grams for a full portion, but here the quantity is about half or slightly less than a full portion. Visually, I estimate the tomato weight to be in the range of 70-90 grams considering the thickness and surface area. The shape and density of tomatoes are consistent with this estimate. Therefore, a midpoint estimate of about 80 grams is reasonable and plausible in this context."

The image shows a bowl containing a creamy mixture with visible chia seeds. The food item séré maigre corresponds to the dairy base mixed with the chia seeds and the purée de noisettes. The volume of this mixture fills roughly half of a small bowl, and considering the density of séré maigre (a low-fat quark-type cheese with thick creamy texture), along with some added ingredients, the total volume likely corresponds to a portion close to a standard single serving. A typical portion of séré maigre is about 150 grams, but since this includes the weight of potato purée noisettes and chia seeds, it should be adjusted downward. Chia seeds and purée de noisettes are dense but present in smaller quantities and dispersed. Estimating the séré maigre itself to be approximately 100-130 grams is reasonable as it forms the majority of the volume. Given the partial mixing and visible surface area, a midpoint estimate of around 115 grams for the séré maigre portion is plausible and consistent with Swiss portion sizing."

The image shows a slice of strawberry tart (tarte aux fraises) with visible strawberries on top and a creamy filling on a pastry base. The slice appears to be a modest portion, roughly a sixth or an eighth of a standard tart given the plate size and the amount of crumbs. The strawberries on top look like about 6-7 medium strawberries or halves, which aligns with about 90-140 grams of strawberries assuming 15-20g per strawberry. However, since this is a mixed tart portion, the total weight of the slice including the crust, cream, and strawberries is obviously more. Considering the typical slice size of a strawberry tart in Switzerland and the visible volume, a slice this size would weigh around 120-150 grams in total. Focusing only on the tarte aux fraises as the entire portion (since the tart is the only food item), the estimate is near 135 grams given the visible size and density of cream and crust."

The image shows a plate with chips labeled as 'chips vaya beans'. These chips are thin and crispy, likely made from beans which are lighter than traditional fried potato chips. The chips are piled loosely, covering most of a small-to-medium size plate, suggesting a moderate volume but low density. Based on the volume and appearance, and recognizing that bean chips typically weigh less per volume than potato chips, a standard portion of about 30-40 grams seems plausible. Considering the pile size and the thinness of the chips, I estimate the weight to be around 35 grams, with a plausible range between 30 and 40 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing two types of dry flakes or seeds: a lighter beige portion on the right side which corresponds to oat flakes (flocon d'avoine), and a darker pile on the left side that looks like flax seeds. The oat flakes portion occupies roughly half of the bowl with a relatively shallow layer, spread flat rather than heaped. Given the sparse, dry, and loose appearance of oatmeal flakes, typical density is low. The amount appears to correspond to a small to moderate dry portion. Dry oat flakes typically weigh around 35-50 grams for this kind of visual volume in a small bowl. Considering Swiss portioning which tends to be moderate, and the fact that the flakes are not piled very thickly, I estimate the oat flakes weigh approximately 40 grams. The plausible range is around 35-45 grams based on visible volume and container size."

The food item is a galette or flatbread wrap, cut into two pieces and partially opened to show filling. A typical Swiss flatbread wrap or galette is thin and light, with an average weight around 50 to 70 grams per full wrap depending on thickness and size. Judging by the size compared to the metal container, the galette is about 20-25 cm in length and looks standard thickness. Since one wrap is folded and cut into two sections but all parts are present in the image, the full wrap portion weight should be considered. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes and the visual scale, the estimated weight range is 55-75 grams, with a midpoint at approximately 65 grams. This accounts for the wrap without filling, which is what is asked."

The salade (salad) portion is located at the top right of the plate and consists of leafy greens with some small additional mixed ingredients. The portion size is quite small relative to the risotto next to it. Given the relatively low density of leafy salad and the visible amount covering a small area of the plate with a single folded leaf and some mixed contents, the weight is likely less than a full vegetable serving. Swiss portion sizes for cooked vegetables or salads are typically around 150-175g for a full serving, but this is clearly a small side portion. Estimating the salad portion visually, I set a plausible range of about 30-50 grams, leaning towards the midpoint around 40 grams considering its compactness and visible volume. This is consistent with the size of the plate and the relative proportions to the risotto. Therefore, the estimated weight of the salade is about 40 grams."

The waffle is about the size of a standard homemade or store-bought portion, roughly 10 x 7 cm in surface area and about 1.5 to 2 cm thick, which is typical for waffles. Given the dessert-like, relatively light and fluffy texture of waffles, a standard Swiss portion weight for such a waffle is usually around 60-80 grams. Since this waffle doesn't appear overly thick or thin and is a single piece, the estimated weight falls in this range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this gaufre at around 70 grams, balancing between 60 and 80 grams for plausibility."

The carrots ('carotte') are sliced into medium-thick rounds and placed on one side of the plate. There are about 15 visible pieces. Each piece appears to be about 1-1.5 cm thick and 3-4 cm in diameter. Considering the density of cooked carrot, each slice likely weighs around 10-12 grams. Multiplying by the number of slices gives a tentative range of 140-180 grams. Given the visible volume and typical Swiss portion sizes for cooked vegetables (150-175 grams), this estimate seems plausible but slightly on the higher side due to the carrot slice thickness. Thus, a final estimation of approximately 160 grams for the carrots is reasonable."

The salami is presented as several small slices on the plate to the right of the open ham sandwich. The slices appear to be thin and there are about 6 to 7 visible slices, with one partially broken. Each slice looks roughly 3-4 cm in diameter and thinly cut, which is typical for salami slices. A typical Swiss portion of salami for a snack or small side serving is around 30-50 grams. Here, the visible quantity corresponds to a modest snack portion, slightly less than a large deli serving. Estimating per slice at about 5-7 grams (thin, small diameter), the total range would be about 30 to 45 grams. Midpoint estimation gives about 37 grams. This fits typical Swiss portion sizes for a salami snack side and corresponds well with the visual thickness and number of slices. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the salami on the plate to be approximately 37 grams."

The food item 'oeuf' (egg) is located on the right side of the plate. It is a hard-boiled egg cut into roughly two halves, with the yolk clearly visible. The size of the egg halves relative to the tomatoes and asparagus pieces indicates a standard medium-sized egg. A typical hard-boiled egg weighs about 50 grams, considering both white and yolk. Given the egg is cut but otherwise whole, and there are no missing pieces, the entire egg can be estimated to weigh around 50 grams. This fits well within usual portion sizes for a single egg in Switzerland and is plausible in the context of the plate’s overall content and portion sizes."

The sprouts (pousses de graines) are visible in the center-left part of the bowl, surrounded by fresh spinach leaves, cherry tomatoes, and falafels. The quantity appears moderate, with sprouts forming a small pile of thin, lightweight vine-like shoots. Sprouts have a low density and typically weigh very little even in a volume that looks significant. Based on their size relative to the cherry tomatoes (each about 15-20 grams) and the falafels (weighing about 20-25 grams each), the pile of sprouts is estimated at roughly 40-60 grams. Considering the Swiss portion sizes and the visible volume, a midpoint estimate of 50 grams seems appropriate and realistic."

The plate contains two pieces of sliced bread (pain) that appear to be rustic or artisanal style with visible holes and a crust. Each slice looks to be approximately half or slightly more of a typical slice of Swiss bread. Since a full slice of such bread generally weighs about 40-50 grams, each half slice should weigh roughly 20-25 grams. There are two pieces on the plate, so combined they weigh approximately 40-50 grams. Considering the size and density visible in the image, I estimate the total weight of the two pieces of bread to be around 45 grams. The presence of butter, melasse, and confiture on the bread does not affect the bread weight itself."

The beurre (butter) is spread thinly on four pieces of sliced bread. Each piece has a light to moderate coverage of butter. Typical Swiss portion sizes for spreading butter thinly across a piece of bread are around 5-7 grams per slice. Given the moderate amount of butter seen on each slice and the fact that there are four slices, the total butter weight can be estimated. A reasonable range might be 20-28 grams total butter across all four slices. Taking the midpoint gives approximately 24 grams. This estimate accounts for the visual thinness of the layer and the number of slices it covers."

Blevita crackers are known processed foods with standard portion sizes. Typically, a single Blevita cracker weighs around 9 to 10 grams. Since there are four crackers stacked in the image, and they appear to be whole and unbroken, the total weight would be roughly four times that of one cracker. This leads to a weight range of approximately 36 to 40 grams. Taking the midpoint for accuracy, the estimated weight of the Blevita crackers in the image is about 38 grams."

The poulet (chicken) piece is centrally placed on the plate and appears to be a cooked chicken breast portion with some visible sauce. Its size is roughly a typical Swiss serving, neither particularly large nor small when compared to the fries and salad portions beside it. Given that Swiss meat portions are typically 100-120 grams per serving, and judging by the thickness and surface area of this chicken breast, it fits well within this standard range. Considering the visual cues such as the thickness, spread, and comparison with fries, a plausible weight range for the chicken is 110-125 grams. To balance within this range, I estimate the chicken portion at approximately 117 grams."

The tomme fleurette is located on the plate among several other cheeses and food items. It appears as a small wedge-shaped portion with a white rind and a creamy interior. Comparing it to the baguette slice and the piece of trout, the size is relatively small, about 4-5 cm in length and around 2 cm thick. Swiss cheese portions for a variety like tomme fleurette typically range around 30-50 grams per serving, but here the portion is smaller than a typical Swiss portion. Given the visible size and thickness, a range of 25-40 grams seems appropriate. The cheese has a substantial density compared to lighter items. Balancing between the visual small wedge and typical cheese portion sizes, the estimated weight is near the middle, about 33 grams."

Muesli portions are generally around 30 to 50 grams for a single serving, considering the light and airy nature of the clusters. Given the volume and density visible here, I estimate the weight to be in the range of 40 to 50 grams. The midpoint and the reasonable estimate based on appearance is approximately 45 grams."

The target food item is 'salade de carotte, mais, tomates,' which appears as a mixed salad portion on the top center of the plate. Visually, the salad contains grated carrots, yellow corn kernels, halved cherry tomatoes, and some leafy greens. The portion looks to cover an area roughly 7-8 cm in diameter and about 1.5-2 cm thick, with some moisture from dressing making it slightly dense but still light. Given the volume and typical density of mixed vegetable salads, the weight is less than denser items like pizza. The amount is approximately that of a small side salad serving. Swiss portion sizes for vegetables like carrot salad are around 150-175g per standard serving. Considering this salad has corn and tomatoes mixed, and judging from its volume relative to the pizza slices which are typically 120-150g per slice, the salad lessens in mass. I estimate a weight range of approximately 100-130g. The midpoint estimate of 115g reflects the visible, loose texture and volume, so it is consistent with visual and portion size expectations for this mixed salad."
r3bub9,raviolis a la courge,143.0,125.0,18.0,0.3128722499088368,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/r3bub9/dish_media/17c1535c-dc84-4dbb-9668-1d3f9a4a135d,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The food item to estimate is 'raviolis à la courge' (pumpkin ravioli). On the plate, there appear to be about 7 large ravioli pieces arranged with visible filling inside. Each ravioli is roughly the size of about 6-7 cm square in surface area. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes, ravioli are generally pasta filled with vegetable or cheese, and a serving is usually around 120-150 grams in total when cooked. Given the number of raviolis and their size on this plate, the portion seems to be a full Swiss serving but not overly large. Estimating each ravioli weighs about 15-20 grams, the 7 pieces add up to between 105 and 140 grams. Placing the estimate near the midpoint with consideration for some air and lightness inside the pasta, a reasonable weight estimate for these raviolis is 125 grams. This fits well within Swiss portion norms and is visually consistent compared to the other foods on the plate (cherry tomatoes and shredded iceberg lettuce)."

The image shows a pizza divided into several slices on a white plate. The pizza is topped with mushrooms (champignons), black olives (olives), and slices of courgette (zucchini). The target food item is 'pizza champignons, olives, courgettes', which is the entire pizza visible on the plate. The pizza appears to be medium-sized, with visible toppings evenly distributed but not thickly piled. The crust is thin to medium thickness. Based on the size of the plate and the slices, this pizza portion corresponds roughly to a personal-sized pizza about 20-25 cm in diameter. Typical Swiss single serving pizzas of this size weigh about 200-250 grams, including toppings and crust. The mushrooms and courgette are light vegetables, and olives are small and dense but used moderately here. Given the visible toppings and crust thickness, the entire visible pizza likely weighs slightly less than a full small pizza portion because a slice is missing and one slice is smaller. Estimating the weight of the visible pizza altogether, the plausible range is between 180 and 220 grams. Taking the midpoint and adjusting slightly downward for the missing slice, a good estimate is about 200 grams."

The blueberries ('myrtilles') are clearly visible on the left side of the plate. There are about 11 blueberries, each appearing of average size for this fruit type, roughly 1.2 to 1.5 cm in diameter. Blueberries typically weigh about 1 to 2 grams each in Swiss portion sizes. Given that these blueberries are slightly sizable and plump, I estimate approximately 1.5 grams per berry. Multiplying by the count of 11 blueberries, the total weight range is roughly 11 to 17 grams. To align with visual volume and typical Swiss portion size, I place the estimate at the midpoint around 14 grams, which seems plausible given the size and number of berries on the plate."
p8a2w5,sauce bolognese,136.0,120.0,16.0,0.2644949556338884,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/abad1443-f704-4eb9-9657-7a67252ff801,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The sauce bolognese is the reddish meat and tomato sauce visible on top of the spaghetti. It occupies a moderate portion of the plate over the pasta, spread in a layer about 2-3 cm thick. Given Swiss portion norms, a typical cooked sauce portion accompanying pasta falls around 100-140 grams. Visually, this portion is neither excessively thin nor piled very thickly, suggesting a moderate amount. Considering the size of the plate and the proportion of sauce to pasta, an estimated range of 110-130 grams appears plausible. The midpoint would be approximately 120 grams, which aligns well with typical Swiss servings of meat sauce as a single portion. This weight estimate excludes the pasta and cheese and focuses strictly on the bolognese sauce portion visible on the plate."

The target food is 'épautre cuit' (cooked spelt), located on the left side of the container. The visible amount of cooked spelt grains fills approximately one third of the container's bottom area, with the grains appearing well separated but densely packed. Given the container size relative to the eggs and aubergine portions, this looks like a single Swiss portion serving. Cooked spelt has a density somewhat similar to cooked wheat or other grains, and typical Swiss portions for cooked grains like rice or pasta are about 80-150g depending on the type, with spelt being similar to cooked pasta or slightly denser. Considering this portion's volume and density, I estimate a typical portion range of 130-160g. The spelt here is about 1.5 times the typical cooked rice Swiss portion (80-100g) and slightly more than a pasta portion, so a midpoint estimate is reasonable around 145g. This estimate fits the visual volume without under- or overestimating compared to the other components in the dish."

The image shows a small glass jar filled predominantly with a mixture of yogurt and oats, within which the chia seeds (graine de chia) are visibly dispersed. Chia seeds are small and dense, but because they are mixed throughout the container and not piled separately, their total volume is relatively modest. Based on typical mixtures for overnight oats or similar preparations, a usual portion of chia seeds added is about 15-20 grams per serving, enough to saturate the visible portion but not overly dense or layered. The jar size suggests a total serving of the whole preparation around 200-250 grams, with the chia seeds only representing a minor fraction. The plausible range for chia seeds here is 15-25 grams. I estimate the final weight of the chia seeds in this mixture at approximately 20 grams, accounting for visual dispersion and typical portion size used in such dishes."

The target food item is 'tartine mélasse + beurre', which is the slice of bread on the bottom of the plate with butter and molasses spread. The slice is of medium thickness and roughly half of a small rustic bread loaf slice. Typical weight for a slice of such bread is about 40-50 grams. The butter spread looks to be about 5-7 grams considering a thin layer. The molasses is a thinner layer and likely adds around 2-3 grams. Adding these together, a reasonable weight range is about 45-60 grams in total. Placing the estimate near the midpoint, I estimate the total weight of the tartine mélasse + beurre to be approximately 53 grams."

The target food is 'beurre' (butter), which is located at the top right of the plate as a small rectangular slice. It appears to be a modest serving typical for a single meal portion, roughly the size of a small sugar cube or slightly larger. Butter density is high, so even a small volume weighs a fair amount. Comparing it to the slice of baguette and other cheese pieces present on the plate, this serving is approximately 2.5 cm long, 1 cm wide, and about 0.8 cm thick, which corresponds to roughly 15-20 grams of butter in typical portion sizes. Considering that Swiss portion sizes tend to be moderate, and visually this is a small slice, I estimate the weight range between 15 and 20 grams. Final estimate near midpoint is 17 grams."

The salad consists of green lettuce leaves, carrot strips, and pieces of avocado, lightly dressed with olive oil and vinegar. The salad portion appears to cover a sizable part of the plate and looks to be around a typical Swiss serving size for mixed salad with some denser vegetables (avocado and carrot). Leafy greens are light, but the avocado adds some weight. Swiss typical vegetable portions are about 150-175 grams per serving. Considering the visible volume and density of components, an estimated range would be 140-160 grams. Taking a value near the midpoint but slightly lowered for leaf volume, the estimated weight of the salad is approximately 150 grams."

The specified food item is 'demi croissant,' which is visually identifiable as half of a croissant. The croissant piece shown is approximately half of a typical small Swiss croissant. A full croissant usually weighs around 50-60 grams in Switzerland. Given this is a half portion and appears to be a standard size, the weight should be roughly half of that, around 25-30 grams. The presence of butter and apricot jam on top does not add significantly to the croissant's weight, as the question focuses on the 'demi croissant.' Considering the size and typical weights, the plausible range is 25-30 grams. I estimate the weight of the demi croissant to be 27 grams as a midpoint estimate."

The pasta (pâtes) is clearly visible in the bottom half of the plate as cooked spiral pasta piled under a dollop of mozzarella. The portion looks typical for a Swiss meal and occupies about one third of the plate area, with a reasonable depth considering piled pasta. Swiss reference portion sizes for cooked pasta are about 120-150 grams per serving. Given the visible amount here, slightly heaped but not overly large, it fits well within this range. The presence of other foods (green beans with oil, kidney beans, mozzarella) on the plate helps confirm that the pasta portion is moderate and balanced with other components. Therefore, I estimate the cooked pasta weight to be approximately 135 grams, which is near the midpoint of the typical portion range."

The image shows a piece of bread ('pain') topped with a spread of chestnut cream ('crème de marrons'). The piece of bread looks like a small slice torn from a larger loaf. The bread slice itself appears to weigh approximately 20-25g based on its size and typical density. The crème de marrons spread is visibly applied in a thin to moderate layer covering most of the bread's surface. Chestnut cream is a dense, moist spread, but given the thin layer and partial coverage, the quantity should be modest. The visible volume corresponds roughly to about 20-30g of cream. Based on these observations and typical portion sizes, the amount of crème de marrons on this slice of bread is likely in the range of 20-30 grams. Taking a midpoint estimate, I conclude the weight of the crème de marrons is approximately 25 grams."

The mayonnaise is visible as a single dollop on the plate to the left side. It occupies a small area but is thick and creamy. Mayonnaise is dense and typically weighs about 13-15 grams per tablespoon. Visually, the serving looks like roughly one to one and a half tablespoons. Considering the modest portion size typical in Swiss servings alongside the other foods on the plate, a reasonable weight range would be 13-20 grams. Midpoint estimate is about 17 grams, which fits the observed volume, texture, and common portion for mayonnaise on a plate of mixed foods."

The mozzarella is the white creamy portion on top of the pasta on the plate. It appears as a single dollop, about the size of a small scoop or quenelle, typical for a side serving of fresh mozzarella or burrata. Considering typical Swiss portions, mozzarella servings on a plate like this usually range between 50 and 80 grams. The volume looks moderate, not too large or too small, balanced with the pasta and vegetables. Given this, I estimate a weight range of 50-80 grams and choose a midpoint value for accuracy. Therefore, the estimated weight of the mozzarella is approximately 65 grams."

The image shows a single chocolate bar, partially unwrapped and held in a hand. The chocolat bar is slender and covered with bits that appear to be nuts or crisped rice. The size relative to the fingers holding it suggests the bar is about 10 cm long and approximately 2 cm wide and not very thick. These characteristics resemble typical Swiss chocolate snack bars like a 'branche de chocolat.' Standard portion sizes for such bars usually range around 30 to 40 grams. Given the compact size and density of the chocolate, the bar likely weighs near the midpoint of this range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'branche de chocolat' in the image to be approximately 35 grams."

The riz complet (brown rice) is visible on the plate as a loose mound on the left side. It looks like a typical cooked portion of rice but with the slightly coarser texture of brown rice. Given the Swiss portion size for cooked rice is generally around 80-100g and considering the volume shown here, the portion appears moderate but not oversized. The rice mound is roughly comparable in size to a standard small bowl serving. Thus, estimating a range between 85g to 100g seems reasonable. Choosing a midpoint, the estimate is about 92 grams for the riz complet portion. This fits well with the visible quantity and Swiss portion standards."

The fresh spinach (épinards frais) is clearly visible as the leafy green base of the salad, covering most of the bowl's bottom. The spinach leaves appear fresh and roughly in normal portion sizes for a salad base. Given the total volume and typical density of fresh spinach, the portion looks similar to a medium salad serving side portion in Switzerland, which generally ranges between 50-70 grams. Since the spinach leaves are fresh and compacted slightly but not densely packed or piled, a reasonable weight range would be 50-70 grams. I estimate the final weight to be around 60 grams, near the middle of this range."

The butter (beurre) is located at the bottom right of the plate, clearly visible as a small portion separated from other items. It appears to be a typical serving size spread, roughly the size of a small pat or cube. Based on the visual comparison to the two small grilled bread pieces and the slices of turkey above, the butter portion looks like about 10-15 grams. Swiss butter portions in meals like this are typically small, around 10-20 grams, especially when served as a side to bread. Given the size and shape, the reasonable range is 10-15 grams, so I estimate the butter weight to be 13 grams."

The image shows peeled and sliced pieces of raw kohlrabi (colrave crue) arranged in a small disposable plastic container lid, used here as a plate. The pieces are medium-sized chunks, with roughly 15-20 pieces visible. Kohlrabi is a dense, crunchy vegetable with a high water content. Given the size and volume of the pieces relative to the lid, and the compact stacking, the total weight looks to be similar to a medium portion of raw vegetables, somewhat smaller than a typical cooked vegetable portion due to the density and raw state. Considering a typical raw vegetable portion size is around 150g, and this visual portion is a bit smaller, I estimate the range between 90 and 130 grams. The midpoint of this range would be about 110 grams. Therefore, weighing the visual clues and Swiss portion sizing, I estimate the weight of the raw kohlrabi pieces to be approximately 110 grams."

The sauce vinaigrette is visible lightly drizzled on top of several ingredients like the tofu, carrotes râpées, and some scattered on avocado and beetroot pieces. Vinaigrette sauce typically has a low density and is applied as a thin layer or small droplets, resulting in a small total mass despite covering multiple foods. The container is medium-sized and mostly filled with solid foods rather than liquid sauce. Based on visual observation, the amount of vinaigrette looks to be roughly 1 to 2 tablespoons, which commonly weighs between 15 to 25 grams. Considering the Swiss portions and the visible quantity, a range of 15-25 grams is plausible, and a midpoint estimate of about 20 grams is reasonable."

The pasta is fusilli, partially covered with a tomato-based sauce and a generous amount of grated Parmesan. The portion appears to fill roughly one third of the container's base area, and from the visible depth and compactness, it looks like a typical Swiss portion size. Considering cooked pasta typically weighs between 120-150 grams per serving in Switzerland and accounting for the moderate sauce and cheese on top, this portion seems to be near the upper middle of that range. Other items like grilled chicken and green beans in the container provide scale and confirm this is a single meal portion. Therefore, estimating a weight range between 130-150 grams is reasonable, and selecting a midpoint of 140 grams is appropriate for this pasta portion."

The specified food item is 'mélasse,' which is visible on the top slice of bread, spread unevenly over the butter. The portion of molasses appears thinly spread across nearly the entire slice of bread, about the size of a standard slice of rustic or country bread. Given the thin layer and the surface area covered, the quantity of molasses is likely small but enough to provide noticeable coverage. Molasses is quite dense but used sparingly. A thin spread covering a slice of this size generally corresponds to about 10 to 15 grams. Considering the amount visible and typical usage, an estimated weight range of 10 to 15 grams is plausible, with a midpoint estimate around 13 grams. This fits with the visible spread and typical consumption quantities on such bread portions in Switzerland."

The target food item is 'yaourt nature' (plain yogurt), which is clearly visible in the image as an opened small plastic container filled almost to the top. This type of yogurt container is common in Switzerland and typically holds around 125 grams of yogurt. The yogurt appears to be unaltered and full, with no visible spoon marks or quantity removed. Given the standard portion size for single-serve plain yogurt containers, and the visual confirmation of filling, the weight is likely close to this standard. The neighboring apple provides a size and scale reference, confirming the container's typical small size. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'yaourt nature' at about 125 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing a mixture of blanc battu (quark-like dairy), oats, chia seeds, and honey. The chia seeds appear sparsely distributed within the mix, visible as small black dots scattered throughout. Given this, the chia seeds are used as a minor ingredient, likely added by the tablespoon rather than by volume. A standard tablespoon of chia seeds weighs roughly 12-15 grams. Considering the visible quantity relative to the other ingredients and the typical portion size for chia seeds in such mixtures, I estimate the chia seeds weigh between 12 and 18 grams. A midpoint estimate near 15 grams seems reasonable and consistent with the visible amount in this portion size."

The target food item is 'beurre' (butter), which is spread on two slices of bread visible on the plate. The butter is a thin layer beneath either the jam or the Nutella spread. Given the visible area covered and the typical thin spreading of butter on bread slices in Swiss portions, the butter amount is likely small. Typically, a thin butter spread on one slice of bread is around 5-7 grams. Since there are two slices with butter, the total butter weight would be about 10-14 grams. Considering some spots have less coverage, I estimate the total butter weight to be around 12 grams. This estimate aligns with typical portion sizes for spreading butter on bread and matches the visible coverage and context accurately."

The carrots are visible as thin sliced or shaved pieces mixed within the dish, mostly concentrated in small sections along with the aubergines and pasta. There are about 5 to 6 visible carrot slices, each slice being relatively thin and small. Given the appearance and standard cooked vegetable density, the total weight for these carrot slices is likely in the range of 25 to 40 grams. Considering the Swiss portion size for cooked vegetables typically around 150-175g for a full serving and noting that the carrots here are only a part of the mixed meal and occupy roughly a small portion of the bowl, an estimate near the middle of this range at 32 grams seems reasonable. This aligns well with the visual volume and distribution of carrots within the dish."
ppf8hc,parmesan,14.0,8.0,6.0,0.010210283213808192,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/2833b10a-52c7-409b-ad86-f6147c323f9e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The specified food item is 'parmesan', which is a hard cheese typically grated and sprinkled on dishes like risotto. In the image, the risotto aux asperges is present on a plate, and there is a visible light dusting or some melted parmesan integrated within or on top of the risotto. The parmesan is not present in solid chunks or thick layers; it appears to be a small amount used more as a flavoring garnish rather than a substantial portion. Typical cheese garnish portions for a Swiss meal are around 5-15 grams unless there is a clear, visible solid chunk or more substantial amount, which is not the case here. Given the small visible distribution and typical serving habits, I estimate the parmesan weight to be about 8 grams, considering a plausible range of 5-12 grams."
2ahgvr,toast,55.0,60.0,5.0,0.033426522426157776,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/feb15752-d5e3-4f73-8eeb-9fb560cc6f6b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two slices of toast on a plate with some white spread on top which is the fromage frais. The toast slices appear to be standard size, roughly 10x10 cm each, typical for sliced bread. A single slice of standard whole wheat or multigrain bread toast usually weighs around 30 grams. Since there are two slices, the total weight of the toast would be about 60 grams. The fromage frais spread on each slice appears to be light and unevenly spread, covering the surface but thinly applied. Typically, a thin layer of fromage frais on toast can be estimated around 15 grams per slice. For two slices, this totals about 30 grams of fromage frais. Considering Swiss portions tend to be slightly smaller, 12-15 grams per slice of fromage frais on toast is plausible. So the total toasted bread weight is about 60 grams, but since the target is 'toast' only (not the fromage frais), my estimate is 60 grams for the toast (the bread). This fits well with standard bread slice weights and the visible size relative to the plate. The range could reasonably be between 55 to 65 grams, so the midpoint estimate of 60 grams is chosen."

The target food item is 'beurre' (butter), which is spread thinly on a single slice of 'tresse' bread. The slice is about the size of a typical Swiss breakfast bread slice, roughly 10 cm long and 6-7 cm wide. The butter is spread thinly but covers a large part of the slice's surface. Considering that a standard pat or serving of butter used on a slice of bread in Switzerland is approximately 5 to 10 grams, and given the visible thin layer, I estimate the butter to be on the lighter side of this range. Thus, I estimate the butter weight to be between 5 and 8 grams, with a midpoint around 6.5 grams. This fits well with the visual impression of a thin spread of butter without clumps or thick pats."

The image shows a slice of bread (pain) on a colorful patterned plate. The bread is a rustic or country-style whole grain loaf, with a thick crust and a soft, airy interior. The size of the slice is roughly half a small baguette or similar bread roll. Given the typical density of such bread and the visible thickness and volume, the slice likely weighs between 45 and 65 grams. Considering it is a relatively thick slice with some crust, an estimate near the middle of this range is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this bread slice to be approximately 55 grams."

The biscuit is visible on top of the ice cream in the glass. It appears as a relatively thin, crispy wafer with some broken pieces but overall a small volume. Given its thinness and size compared to the glass, it is likely a light, crisp biscuit rather than a dense cookie. Typically, such biscuits weigh around 10-15 grams each. Considering this biscuit is a single small piece with some broken parts, I estimate the total weight to be approximately 12 grams. This fits well with the visible size compared to the ice cream scoops and the kiwi slices inside the glass."

The food item to estimate is 'huile de lin' (linseed oil) which is a liquid and difficult to see in the image as a separate visible portion; it is most likely lightly drizzled or mixed into the dish. Given the plate's visible contents and typical usage of linseed oil as a dressing or finishing oil, a realistic portion would be around 10 to 15 grams (approximately 1 tablespoon). Since the oil does not appear in a separate container or as a visible quantity on the plate and is probably incorporated into the other items, estimating the weight at the midpoint of this range, 12 grams, is reasonable and consistent with typical Swiss portion sizes for oils used in a meal of this type."

The image shows a mostly finished plate with one small, remaining slice of pizza. The slice appears to be about a quarter of a small pizza base typically served in Swiss portions. The pizza slice has visible toppings including mushrooms and tomato sauce. Considering the small size of the slice and typical thin crust pizza, a whole Swiss pizza ranges roughly between 250g to 350g in total weight. A quarter slice would therefore be approximately 60-90g. Given that this slice also appears slightly smaller than a full quarter of a pizza, and factoring in the light toppings and a moderate crust thickness, a plausible weight range is around 50-70g, with a midpoint estimate near 60g. This fits well with Swiss portion expectations and visual cues."

The image shows a dark plate with a slice of whole wheat or brown bread on it. The bread slice appears to be of medium thickness and roughly standard size for Swiss bread slices, which typically weigh between 40 and 55 grams. Given the size relative to the omelette piece and the plate, the bread slice seems neither unusually thick nor thin. Considering typical Swiss portion sizes for bread slices, an estimated weight range of 45-55 grams is reasonable. Choosing a midpoint within this range given the visible thickness and size, I estimate the slice of bread to weigh approximately 50 grams."

The specified food item is 'pain' (bread). The image shows a slice of white bread, approximately half of a typical small Swiss bread roll, as suggested by the crust and porous texture. Given the size relative to the plate, the slice likely weighs about 30-40 grams. Swiss bread portions tend to be smaller than North American ones. Considering this is a partial slice and not a full roll or large slice, the estimated range is about 30-40 grams. Taking the midpoint, I estimate the bread slice to weigh around 35 grams."

The specified food item is 'beurre' (butter). In the image, there are two slices of bread, each spread with different toppings. The top slice has a visibly uneven but moderate layer of butter (beurre) mixed with mélasse, and the bottom slice has a layer of Nutella. The butter is spread mostly thinly across one slice. Considering a typical serving of butter spread on a slice of bread, the weight usually ranges between 5 to 10 grams. Given the thickness and coverage seen here, the butter amount appears closer to the middle-upper end of this range but not overly thick. Therefore, a plausible range would be 6 to 9 grams. Taking the midpoint, the estimated weight of the butter is approximately 7.5 grams."

The œuf dur (hard-boiled egg) is located on the left side of the plate and is cut in half. A whole typical hard-boiled egg weighs about 50 grams, including the shell, but since we consider it peeled here, the edible part is roughly 45-50 grams. The halves appear average in size and fully visible, with no missing parts. Given standard Swiss portion sizes and visual proportion compared to the other foods (boulgour and ratatouille), the estimate should be close to the full edible egg weight. Thus, I estimate the œuf dur weight to be around 48 grams, within a plausible range of 45-50 grams."

The hummous is visible on the bottom left of the plate in a small dollop shape. Comparing its size to nearby items helps gauge the weight: it is roughly the size of a heaped tablespoon or slightly more, which usually weighs around 30-50 grams in Swiss portions. The hummous appears to be a modest serving typical for a breakfast or snack plate, not overly large or spread out. Considering the density of hummous, which is relatively thick and creamy, and the visual volume, a range of 35-45 grams seems reasonable. The midpoint estimate of about 40 grams fits well with the visual evidence and typical portion sizes without overestimating."
