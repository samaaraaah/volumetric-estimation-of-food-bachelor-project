The ratatouille is the colorful vegetable mixture on the right side of the plate. It consists of chopped vegetables like tomatoes, peppers, and zucchini, cooked together. The portion appears to be spread out but is not very thick. Considering the size of the plate and comparing it to the other items (like the bulgur and the eggs), the ratatouille likely weighs less than it visually appears due to its low density. Based on the visible portion, I estimate the weight of the ratatouille to be approximately 150 grams."

The specified food item is 'concombre' (cucumber). In the image, the cucumber is visible as chopped pieces mixed into the couscous salad. The pieces are medium-sized chunks, and they are distributed throughout the dish. Based on the size of the container and the proportion of cucumber relative to the other ingredients, I estimate that the cucumber makes up about 20-25% of the total volume of the dish. The container appears to hold approximately 500-600 grams of food in total. Considering the density of cucumber, which is relatively low compared to couscous or tuna, I estimate the weight of the cucumber to be around 100-120 grams. To remain precise, I will estimate the cucumber weight as 110 grams."

The ratatouille is visible inside the wrap, mixed with other ingredients like grilled chicken and possibly cheese. The ratatouille appears to be a small portion, as it is only part of the filling and not the dominant component. Based on the visible volume of the ratatouille within the wrap, I estimate its weight to be approximately 40 grams. This accounts for its low density and the fact that it is mixed with other ingredients."

The image shows three small red fruits that resemble cherry tomatoes rather than strawberries (fraise). Since the input specifies 'cracotte craquinette fraise,' it seems there is a mismatch between the input and the image. However, based on the visible items, I will estimate the weight of the three cherry tomatoes. Each cherry tomato appears to be of average size, approximately 10-15 grams each. With three tomatoes, the total weight would be around 30-45 grams. I will estimate the weight as 40 grams to account for slight variations."
