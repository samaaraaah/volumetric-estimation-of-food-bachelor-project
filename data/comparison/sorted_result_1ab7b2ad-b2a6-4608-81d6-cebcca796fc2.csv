The image shows a single beer bottle. The specified item is 'biere,' and we are estimating the weight of the liquid beer inside the bottle, excluding the bottle itself. Standard beer bottles typically contain 330 ml of liquid. Since the density of beer is close to water, 330 ml of beer would weigh approximately 330 grams. Assuming the bottle is full, the estimated weight of the beer is 330 grams."

The cherry tomatoes are clearly visible in a cardboard container, still attached to their vines. The container appears to be full, with multiple clusters of cherry tomatoes. Each cherry tomato is small and dense, typically weighing around 15-20 grams. Based on the size of the container and the number of tomatoes visible, I estimate there are approximately 25-30 cherry tomatoes. Assuming an average weight of 18 grams per tomato, the total estimated weight is 500 grams."
