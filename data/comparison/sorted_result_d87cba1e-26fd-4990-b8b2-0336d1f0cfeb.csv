p96w4a,délice tomate mozzarella,54.0,320,266.0,1.5413670994741926,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/5ebafbd6-315d-44a6-8508-ba143d23adb2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The 'délice tomate mozzarella' is shown on the plate as alternating slices of tomato and mozzarella layered neatly, with some balsamic vinegar and herbs sprinkled on top. There appear to be about 6-7 slices each of tomato and mozzarella, each slice about 1 cm thick. Tomatoes are quite light, while mozzarella is denser. A medium tomato slice typically weighs around 20-30 grams depending on size, and mozzarella slices of similar thickness would weigh about 25-30 grams each. Estimating about 7 slices times an average of 25g for mozzarella gives about 175 grams, and the tomato slices likely weigh a bit less due to lower density, around 150 grams total. Combined, the total weight would be around 320-330 grams. Considering only the 'délice tomate mozzarella' as a combined food item, the overall estimate accounting for the layering and some loss from drainage and slicing is about 320 grams, which fits a medium portion size for this item."
xjvrtk,tonic au gingembre,200.0,20,180.0,3.863075437278678,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/c70f93c3-23cc-4817-bbe9-93091771b273,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a nearly empty glass bottle labeled 'Ginger Birra Mendrisio,' which matches the description 'tonic au gingembre.' The bottle appears to be a standard glass bottle typically used for specialty sodas or tonics, and based on the visible size and typical packaging standards for such beverages, it likely holds around 200 to 250 ml when full. Since the bottle is almost empty, the content left inside is minimal, but the question concerns the total weight of the item as served (the bottle content weight without the bottle). Given that the food item is the beverage itself, for a full bottle the weight of the liquid (tonic) is approximately equivalent to its volume in grams because liquids like tonic water have densities close to water. So a full bottle would be roughly 200-250 grams, but here the bottle is essentially empty, so the tonic content is near zero. Since the task is to estimate the weight of the tonic as it appears in the image and it is essentially empty, the weight is very low, close to zero. However, if the intent is to estimate a standard serving seen on the table, the total content would be about 220 grams (typical for this bottle size). I conclude the weight of the tonic au gingembre (the liquid content in the bottle) is approximately 220 grams when full but near zero in this image. Since the focus is the actual visible amount and it is almost empty, the weight should be estimated at around 20 grams, considering some residual liquid inside the bottle."
p8a2w5,dahl de lentille,281.0,130,151.0,4.5531709410881,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/5ddea52e-8411-4822-893f-d8420fa6cb40,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'dahl de lentille', which is visible mixed with rice in a white bowl. The dahl appears to be orange lentils cooked with vegetables, visible as small chunks and a saucy mixture. The bowl is roughly medium-sized and appears about half full with the total mixture of rice and dahl. Visual inspection shows the dahl portion mixed evenly with rice but not dominating volume. Considering the typical cooked density of lentil dahl, and the portion occupying about 30-40% of the bowl's contents, I estimate the dahl weighs less than the rice portion. Swiss cooked lentil dahl portions as side dish typically range around 120-180g. Given the moderate bowl volume and mixing, the dahl here appears to be closer to a smaller side portion, around 100-150g. For a precise estimate based on visual density and volume relative to the bowl size and rice portion, I assign approximately 130g as a reasonable weight for the dahl de lentille in this dish."
xjvrtk,ananas,200.0,350,150.0,3.2192295310655648,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/b41068f9-5a0e-4c11-bf1b-7389d3917889,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a blue plate with several pieces of fresh cut pineapple (ananas). Each piece is a triangular chunk, with different sizes but generally medium-sized. The pieces do not seem densely packed on the plate, giving a clearer view of their approximate volume. Pineapple is mostly water, so while the volume looks fairly large, the density is moderate. There are about 13 pieces visible. Given the average chunk size and typical pineapple density, each piece likely weighs around 25-30 grams. Multiplying, the total weight is roughly between 320 and 390 grams. Considering the size and number of pieces, and checking with the Swiss fruit portion reference (150-300g typical per serving), this portion looks slightly large but still reasonable. Hence, the estimate is around 350 grams."
xjvrtk,courgette et oignons,300.0,155,145.0,4.667882820045069,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The courgette et oignons are located on the left side of the container. The portion looks like roughly one medium-sized cooked courgette sliced and mixed with onions. The vegetables are cooked and appear softened but not pureed. Considering the container size and the visible volume relative to the millet, black bean and corn patties on the right, the cooked courgette and onion portion seems moderate. Typical cooked vegetable Swiss portions range from 120g to 250g. Given the volume here, the portion appears somewhat dense but limited in height, filling about half the container's area. I estimate a plausible range between 130g to 180g, leaning towards a medium portion size. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the courgette et oignons weight is about 155 grams."
2ahgvr,salade grecque,315.0,450,135.0,4.563257860285439,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/c476a6d0-acb2-45fd-b168-84822bc98003,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a rectangular plastic container filled about halfway with a chopped Greek salad (salade grecque). The salad pieces include diced cucumber, tomato, yellow bell pepper, olives, onion slices, and small chunks of feta cheese. Considering the container size and the visible volume, the salad is packed with small, dense vegetable pieces and cheese. The container appears to be a typical small meal prep container, likely around 1 liter in volume. Since it is about half full, the visible volume of the salad is roughly 400-500 ml. Given the density of mixed chopped vegetables and cheese in a salad, a rough weight estimate is around 0.9-1.1 grams per ml, leading to an estimated weight range about 360-550 grams. Considering the salad is not packed very tightly and some space is occupied by air gaps and the dressing, a medium estimate near the lower-middle of the range is appropriate. This results in a final estimated weight of approximately 450 grams for the salade grecque in the container, which is plausible given the portion size and contents."
xjvrtk,tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe,250.0,140,110.0,2.950960403476768,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/f607625b-a07d-423e-a564-4d96ebadf084,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single triangular slice of tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe on a standard-sized dessert plate. The slice appears thin with a crispy crust and a topping of diced rhubarb and apple pieces embedded in a creamy base. The amount of fruit is fairly even but not piled thickly, suggesting a moderate volume. Considering the thinness of the crust and the fruit topping, the density is not high but certainly more substantial than a plain tart slice due to the fruit and cream. A typical tarte flambée slice of this size (about a quarter of a 30 cm round tart) usually weighs between 120 and 160 grams. Given the moderate topping coverage and typical portion size observed, this slice likely weighs around 140 grams. This fits well within Swiss portion norms for a dessert slice and matches the visual evidence of thickness and topping quantity."
wrah5h,porc,52.0,150,98.0,0.546839789677004,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/f727ac79-973e-4b92-8f2b-cda94222d4a7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The 'porc' (pork) appears as a single piece under a white sauce in the bottom left corner of the container. It looks like a cooked pork chop or a similarly sized cut, covering part of the container's base. The size relative to the grilled eggplant slices and the portion of polenta with cheese suggests it is a moderate serving. Swiss portion guidelines for meat are 120-180g. Given the thickness and surface area visible, this pork piece seems to be on the medium to slightly larger side, but not overly large. It doesn't appear exceptionally thick but has adequate volume. Therefore, a reasonable weight estimate for the 'porc' is around 150 grams, which aligns well with visual size and Swiss portion standards."
ppf8hc,pâtes carbonara,236.0,140,96.0,2.4311621418607148,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/4d4e6539-b86f-4019-b2aa-0c15dbce0667,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate containing a portion of pâtes carbonara topped with a visible amount of grated gruyère cheese. The pasta portion includes penne and some other pasta shapes with creamy carbonara sauce and small pieces of ham or bacon. The portion covers a moderate area of a regular-sized dinner plate and is not heaped but spread out relatively thinly. Based on the size and volume, typical cooked pasta Swiss serving sizes range from 100 to 170 grams, but this portion appears near the lower to medium side of that range due to modest quantity and some spread. The added bacon/wrapped meat pieces add some weight but are minor here. The grated gruyère on top looks like about 15-20 grams. Since the question targets only the pâtes carbonara (which typically includes pasta, sauce, and meat), I will combine the carbonara ingredients including pasta and bacon bits but exclude the grated gruyère as it is listed separately. Based on visual density, plate coverage, and typical portions, I estimate the weight of the pâtes carbonara on the plate around 140 grams. This fits within the Swiss portion size for cooked pasta dishes, adjusted for the visible modest amount and balanced by the presence of meat pieces and sauce."
2ahgvr,porridge salé,48.0,140,92.0,0.47387058697285117,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a35f3211-3b33-4826-97b8-3af69655dada,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The porridge salé is contained in a small glass jar with a gold lid, visible from the proportion of the jar opening which is marked as 70 mm in diameter. The jar is about half full of porridge. Considering the relatively dense and thick texture of porridge, and the apparent volume filled inside the jar, the content likely weighs less than 200 grams since the jar itself is small. Given that this is a savory porridge in a small jar, a realistic estimate of the content weight is between 120 and 160 grams. I choose a median value of approximately 140 grams, which fits with both the container size and the porridge density."
wrah5h,tomates,48.0,140,92.0,0.47387058697285117,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/ee6e8045-59f2-4294-ae6a-1d5695abc176,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'tomates' on the plate, mixed with chopped cucumber. The tomatoes are cut into relatively large chunks, spread evenly but not in a large quantity on the plate. Each piece is about the size of a small bite, and there appear to be around 7-8 chunks of tomato visible. Considering the typical density and water content of tomatoes, each chunk likely weighs around 15-20 grams. Adding these up, the total weight of tomatoes visible is approximately 110-160 grams. Since the portion looks moderate and fits well within Swiss side vegetable portion sizes (100-250g), the estimate is reasonable. I estimate the weight of the tomatoes to be around 140 grams."
wrah5h,betterave,65.0,155,90.0,0.6277497585577851,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/bba5cf64-1d08-40cb-bc6c-bfdd2a7c2116,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The betterave (beetroot) is located on the left side of the plate as a pile of diced pieces. The pieces are roughly uniform cubes, deep red in color, and cover a significant part of the plate's left segment. Visually, the pile seems to form a thick layer about 2-3 cm high and covers an area roughly equivalent to the tomato portion next to it. Beetroot is dense and moist, meaning the volume is a good indicator of weight. Comparing the beetroot portion to the quinoa, which is dense but lighter and normally around 130-220g per serving, the beetroot appears somewhat less in volume but quite dense. Swiss typical cooked vegetable portions range from 120-250g. Since the beetroot portion is moderate in size but not overly large, I'd estimate it closer to the lower-middle part of normal vegetable portions. Based on visual assessment and density, the beetroot weight is likely around 140-170 grams. I choose the middle estimate of 155 grams as a balanced weight for this portion."
p8a2w5,"dalh de lentilles corail (lentilles corail, oignon, carottes, tomates concassées, 1cs huilde d'olive, épices)",271.0,190,81.0,2.355510247880674,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/82b53493-1c97-472b-9ec6-8cc698b8cfe4,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a bowl containing rice and dalh de lentilles corail placed side by side. The dalh portion looks thick and includes visible pieces of carrots and lentils in a tomato-based sauce. The bowl is medium-sized with the dalh filling roughly half of it, with a spoon for scale. The height and density of the dalh suggest a substantial amount. Given typical Swiss portions and the visual fullness, the dalh is likely around 150-220g. The dalh appears moderately dense, not overly airy, and covers a good volume without spilling. Considering the ecological comparison with the rice side (which is typically 130-220g) and the fact that dalh is often served as a main legume dish with vegetables, a medium to large portion estimate is appropriate. Therefore, a reasonable estimate of the dalh weight is approximately 190 grams."
wrah5h,"délice des dieux (biscuit, fruits rouges, séré+mascarpone)",205.0,130,75.0,1.6498551346711021,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/5de398c7-684b-448d-ba0a-f318d009bccd,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a slice of 'délice des dieux', a dessert composed of a biscuit base, red fruits such as raspberries and blueberries, and a creamy layer of séré and mascarpone on top. The portion is roughly rectangular and appears moderately thick, roughly about 1.5 to 2 cm in height. The surface area is similar to a small cake slice, approximately 8 cm by 7 cm. The biscuit base is moist and dense, but not too thick, possibly 0.8 to 1 cm. The creamy mascarpone layer looks smooth and thick, likely making up about half the height of the slice. The fruit pieces are embedded within the biscuit and on top, adding some weight but representing a smaller proportion. Considering the density and composition, and comparing to known weights of similar layered desserts, this slice likely weighs between 110 and 150 grams. Given the visible size and density, I choose a medium value of about 130 grams as the best estimate."
wrah5h,gaufre à la patate douce,85.0,160,75.0,0.6840862753514325,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1876b0b6-568d-4583-8186-073df252e6c9,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The food item to estimate is 'gaufre à la patate douce' (sweet potato waffle). In the image, the waffles are cut into four pieces arranged on a plate. Each piece looks roughly 6-7 cm by 6-7 cm in size and about 1.5-2 cm thick. Considering the light but dense texture of cooked sweet potato in a waffle form, each quarter piece should weigh approximately 35-45 grams. Added together, the four pieces of waffle likely weigh around 140-180 grams in total. Compared to typical Swiss portion sizes for a similar starch-based main dish, this fits within a reasonable range. The sauce and smoked salmon are separate items and not included in this weight. Considering the actual volume and the waffle's density, the best estimate for the total sweet potato waffle portion on the plate is about 160 grams."
2ahgvr,brochette de boeuf,76.0,150,74.0,0.6034982294237579,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/5b8a0853-ecc4-4015-bc9a-2b50766f873a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The 'brochette de boeuf' is the skewer with three chunks of grilled beef, placed near the top center of the plate. Each beef chunk is roughly the size of a large cube, about 3-4 cm in each dimension, typical for skewered meat pieces. Considering Swiss portion sizes for meat, a serving is usually 120-180 grams. Here, the three beef pieces together are moderate in size but not overly large, appearing to be a moderate portion. Given their visual volume and density of cooked beef, I estimate each piece to weigh about 45-55 grams, totaling approximately 150 grams. This aligns well with the visible size relative to the slice of bread and the other food items on the plate, confirming plausibility. Therefore, the estimated weight of the brochette de boeuf is 150 grams."
wrah5h,polenta,209.0,140,69.0,1.547483635583217,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/f727ac79-973e-4b92-8f2b-cda94222d4a7,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The polenta is clearly visible on the right side of the container, topped with shredded cheese. It appears as a compact serving with some volume, roughly covering about a third of the container's base. Given the container is a typical lunch box size, the polenta portion looks like a moderate serving, dense and firm. Swiss cooked polenta portions generally range from about 100 to 170 grams per serving. Given the visual volume here and the cheese topping adding some weight but not compressing the polenta significantly, I estimate this polenta portion to be on the medium size within the Swiss portion range. Therefore, a realistic weight estimate is approximately 140 grams."

The tiramisu is on the left side of the plate. It appears to be about one piece, roughly a rectangular slice approximately 12 cm long, 5 cm wide, and about 4 cm thick. The tiramisu has layers of cream and soaked sponge, which lowers its overall density compared to a dense cake. Given this size and the typical density of tiramisu, the portion likely weighs somewhere between 120 and 160 grams. Considering the visible portion looks substantial but not overly large, a medium estimate of 140 grams is reasonable. This aligns with the typical Swiss portion size for a dessert slice of tiramisu and fits well with the overall plate composition."
p8a2w5,artichaut,143.0,210,67.0,1.0281146045713059,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/9b2c7383-a434-4260-ac30-86103e4546ea,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single cooked artichaut (artichoke) placed on a plate. It appears to be a whole medium-sized artichoke, with the outer leaves intact and no visible trimming of significant portions. Based on the size relative to the hand holding the plate and typical artichoke dimensions, this artichoke would likely weigh between 180 and 250 grams, as cooked artichokes typically lose some weight from raw to cooked state. Considering this is a standard medium size portion, I estimate the weight to be around 210 grams. The sauce on the plate is minimal and does not add to the weight of the artichoke itself."
xjvrtk,salade de tomates,417.0,350,67.0,2.9980684622813607,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'salade de tomates' (tomato salad). Visually, the plate shows about one full medium-sized plate filled with sliced tomatoes, generous balsamic vinegar dressing, sprinkled with flax seeds, and some leafy herbs. The tomato slices are about 1.5 cm thick and cover the plate evenly without excessive piling, indicating a moderately dense layer. Given the size of the plate and the amount of visible tomato slices (roughly equivalent to 3 medium tomatoes), the weight is likely close to the full weight of 3 medium tomatoes. A medium tomato typically weighs between 100-140g. Hence, for 3 tomatoes, the total weight should be between 300-420g. Considering some tomato slices are thinner and slight volume loss from slicing and dressing, a reasonable range is 300-380g. The flax seeds and vinegar add negligible weight compared to the tomato mass, so they do not change the estimate. Swiss portion size for vegetables can be up to around 250g per serving, but here the portion is clearly generous or could be considered a whole salad serving on its own. The estimate is consistent with visual size relative to the utensils and plate diameter. Taking into account the specifics and the generous portion size, I estimate the tomato salad weight at approximately 350 grams."
ppf8hc,poivrons jaune,150.0,95,55.0,0.8852881210430303,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/95e84def-c82b-4360-8390-f5153ff61064,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'poivrons jaune' (yellow bell peppers). In the image, there is one hollowed yellow pepper filled with quinoa and bulgur curry and two slices of the yellow bell pepper placed on the plate. The hollowed pepper half likely weighs less than a full pepper because it has been hollowed out and cooked. The two slices are thinly cut and placed flat, appearing to be roasted or grilled, which reduces their moisture content and weight somewhat. A typical whole fresh yellow bell pepper weighs approximately 150-180 grams. Considering the hollowed pepper half is roughly half the volume of a full pepper, but cooked and softened, I estimate that hollowed half at about 70-80 grams. Each of the two slices appear to be roughly a quarter of a full pepper half each, so together about a half. These slices are thinner and likely weigh around 20-25 grams combined. Adding these parts up, the total amount of visible yellow bell pepper on the plate is around 90-105 grams. Given the visual size, cooking state, and portions shown, a precise estimate would be 95 grams for the yellow bell peppers portion in this image."

The plate shows a modest portion of cooked pasta, specifically tagliatelle or flat noodles, topped with a mushroom cream sauce. The pasta portion appears to cover a relatively small area, approximately the size of a small to medium handful, flattened rather than piled. The pasta portion is visually smaller than a typical full Swiss main serving portion (which ranges between 100-170g). Considering the pasta's density and the visible quantity, I estimate this portion to be on the lighter side, likely between 70 and 100 grams. Valuing it as a medium-small serving, I finalize the estimate at 85 grams. This estimation is supported by the presence of the vegetables on the plate (courgettes gratinée), which suggest the pasta is more a side component than the main volume."

The image shows a single slice of homemade chocolate fondant placed on a plate. The slice looks moderately thick, with a dense, moist texture typical of fondant au chocolat. The length of the slice roughly corresponds to a standard cake slice size, approximately 12-14 cm long and 5-6 cm wide on the widest side, with a height around 3-4 cm. Given the density of this type of cake, which is richer and heavier than a sponge cake but less than a brownie, and its volume, a typical slice of this size weighs between 100 and 140 grams. Considering the slice is neither very thin nor excessively large, I estimate its weight at about 125 grams. This fits typical homemade chocolate cake slice portions and aligns with the visual density and size."

The image shows a glass bowl filled with chocolate yogurt (yogourt chocolat). The yogurt appears to be a medium serving scooped into the bowl, with a creamy and dense texture. The bowl size is small to medium, and the yogurt fills roughly about half to two-thirds of the bowl's volume. Considering standard single serving containers of yogurt, which typically weigh around 125 to 150 grams, and judging by the volume and density visible here, this portion looks slightly less than a full individual yogurt container but more than half. Therefore, the estimated weight of this chocolate yogurt portion would be around 110 to 140 grams. Choosing a medium estimate within this range seems appropriate given the visible amount."

The salade de céleri is located on the bottom right corner of the plate and consists of finely shredded pieces of celery root, appearing creamy in texture. The portion occupies a relatively small area compared to the carrot salad and the chicken. The volume is modest, and the salad looks moderately dense but not packed tightly. Using the visual comparison with the other items on the plate, especially the potato salad (bottom left) and chicken (top left), the salade de céleri portion appears smaller than a typical side serving but still substantial. Swiss vegetable salad portions typically range between 120 and 250 grams, but this portion is visibly smaller, likely closer to the lower end or slightly below typical serving size. I estimate the weight to be approximately 80-110 grams given the modest pile and typical density of celeriac salad. Choosing a medium value in this range, the best estimate is 95 grams."

The kiwi pieces are peeled and chopped into medium slices and piled on one side of a small bowl. The bowl's diameter appears to be about 15 cm, using the stovetop rings as reference. The kiwi pieces cover roughly half the bowl's surface at about 1-2 cm thickness. A whole medium kiwi weighs around 70-80 grams including skin, with peeled and chopped slices weighing slightly less due to trimming. Given the volume and layering of kiwi slices visible, it corresponds to roughly one medium sized kiwi's edible flesh. Therefore, I estimate the kiwi weight in this bowl to be about 75 grams, falling within a typical kiwi portion size for fruit."

The purée de pdt (mashed potatoes) is the base on the plate, spread out in a medium-sized portion. It is about a palm-sized serving and has some thickness, but not excessive height. Mashed potatoes are relatively dense but lighter than many meats. Considering the size of the plate and the other visible items — the pieces of meat and two whole carrots — the mashed potatoes portion is moderate. Swiss portion sizes for potato purée typically range around 150-200 grams serving size. Visually, this serving looks neither particularly small nor very large, so I estimate it to be a medium portion. After adjusting for the spread and thickness visible, the mashed potatoes portion weighs around 160-180 grams. To summarize, given the visual spread and portion depth, the estimated weight for the purée de pdt is 170 grams, which fits within typical Swiss portion sizes and aligns with the visual context on the plate."

The image shows a metal container with various food items neatly arranged in sections. The 'tomate' (tomato) is visible on the left side of the container as sliced red tomato pieces. The slices occupy roughly a quarter of the container's length. Given the visual size and typical density of fresh tomato slices, and comparing their volume with other items like the avocado slices and cubed tofu, the tomato portion appears moderate but not large. Swiss portion sizes for tomato as a side or salad component are often around 70-120 grams. Considering these slices are not very thick and the portion is slightly smaller than a full serving plate, an appropriate estimate is around 90 grams. This fits well with the size of the other components and the total container volume, and it matches a reasonable side portion rather than a main ingredient."

The image shows a bowl containing cereals immersed in milk. The visible cereal portion is relatively sparse and spread over the surface with milk rather than piled up. Typical cereal portions for a bowl range from 30 to 50 grams. Given the spread and thin layer visible, and considering the milk volume which also suggests only a moderate amount of cereal, the portion here looks closer to the smaller side of the typical serving. There are also visible larger chocolate pieces that add some density, but overall the cereal amount is light. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the cereals to be around 35-40 grams. After weighing the visual density and appearance, I select a final value of 38 grams as a precise estimate."

The mozzarella is a single ball, about 7-8 cm in diameter, sitting on the plate with some liquid around it. Mozzarella balls of this size typically weigh between 100 and 125 grams when fresh. Given it is a single piece without visible slicing or missing parts, it appears to be a medium portion typical of a serving size accompanying a salad and some olives. The other items (olives and salad) are relatively small portions, which support the idea that the mozzarella is a modest serving, closer to the lower-middle end of the typical range. Therefore, I estimate the mozzarella weight to be approximately 110 grams."

The image shows a clear glass bottle partially filled with shelled peanuts (cacahuètes). The peanuts fill roughly one-quarter of the bottle's volume. Comparing the bottle to the standard kitchen counter surface and nearby utensils, the bottle appears to be similar in size to a typical glass milk bottle or juice bottle, which generally can hold about 500 ml. Given that peanuts have a density of about 0.6 g/ml (considering their irregular shape and air gaps), the one-quarter volume filled corresponds to approximately 125 ml of peanuts. Multiplying volume by density gives about 75 grams. The volume assessment is approximate but consistent with the visible filling and size of individual peanuts inside. Therefore, the plausible weight range would be 70-80 grams, and a solid middle estimate is about 75 grams."

The 'fromage' (cheese) is clearly visible on the right half of the sandwich, cut into roughly seven rectangular slices and laid out relatively flat. The type of cheese appears semi-hard and the slices are about 5-6 cm long and about 1 cm wide each, with a thickness around 2-3 mm. Considering the density and size, a typical slice of this type of cheese weighs roughly 10-12 grams. Since there are seven slices, the total weight adds up to approximately 70-84 grams. Given the moderate thickness and layering, I estimate the total cheese weight to be about 75 grams. This fits well with the visual density and size in relation to the bread slices, which appear to be normal-sized sandwich bread pieces."

The caviar d'aubergine is visible as a light beige spread on the slice of seeded bread on the right side of the plate. The spread covers most of the bread slice but is not very thick. Considering the typical density of eggplant spread, which is relatively light and moist but not dense, and estimating the volume based on the surface area covered and moderate thickness, the portion corresponds approximately to a tablespoon or slightly more. This would translate roughly into a range of around 30 to 50 grams. Given the moderate coverage and that it is not heavily piled on, I estimate the weight of the caviar d'aubergine as approximately 40 grams."

The image shows a slice of tarte aux fraises on a small plate. The slice contains a visible amount of cream filling, a thin crust base, several halves of strawberries on top, and some small red currants incorporated. The strawberries are medium size and there are about seven halves visible, which would roughly amount to four whole strawberries. Strawberries typically weigh around 25-35 grams each, so four strawberries would weigh around 100-140 grams. However, since they are halved and some may be partially embedded in cream, the total strawberry content visible is probably closer to 110 grams. The cream filling layer adds some weight but appears moderate in thickness, likely around 50-70 grams, and the crust seems relatively thin and fragile with an estimated weight of about 20-30 grams. Combining these components, the total estimated weight of the tarte aux fraises slice is roughly between 180-210 grams. Given this, a balanced estimate for this slice would be around 195 grams."

The image shows a small white bowl containing a creamy apricot yogurt with visible chunks. This appears to be a typical single-serving portion of industrial yogurt transferred from its original packaging to the bowl. Single-serving apricot yogurts usually come in containers ranging from 125 to 150 grams. The quantity in the bowl fills it partially, consistent with a standard individual yogurt cup size. There is no indication that the yogurt has been partially eaten or that the portion is unusually large or small. Given these observations and typical product sizes, the weight of the apricot yogurt with pieces in the bowl is best estimated around 140 grams, which is within the normal single-serving range for such yogurts in Switzerland."

The target food item is 'boulgour' in the image. The bulgur is in the bottom left of the container, appearing as a light beige granulated and cooked grain. It occupies roughly one third of the meal container's base area. The container is a standard meal prep glass container, and the bulgur looks to be loosely packed but with some density typical of cooked bulgur. Compared visually to the cooked ratatouille portion beside it, the bulgur has a slightly compact volume. Given that cooked grains like bulgur have densities similar to cooked rice, and Swiss portion sizes for cooked rice range from 130 to 220 grams, and bulgur portions are commonly similar or slightly lower, I would establish a plausible range from 110 to 170 grams considering the portion size here is moderate, neither particularly small nor large. Visually, the bulgur depth is about 2-3 cm, and the total quantity looks consistent with a medium portion. Thus, a final estimate near the lower-middle part of the range is appropriate. I estimate the bulgur weight to be approximately 140 grams."

The target food item 'yogourt orange sanguine' is mixed in the bowl with cereals and blueberries, appearing as the creamy liquid component binding the mixture. The bowl is medium-sized and filled about three-quarters with the combined mixture. Given that typical plain or fruit-flavored yogourt servings in Switzerland are around 125-150 grams, and considering the yogourt is mixed and distributed throughout the mixture, the total visibly incorporated yogourt is roughly within that range. The consistency looks creamy but not overly liquid, suggesting standard yogurt density. Therefore, it is reasonable to estimate the yogourt weight at about 140 grams, as it aligns with typical serving sizes and visual volume compared to the cereal and blueberries."

The image shows two slices of toast on a plate, each spread with a layer of fromage frais. The toast slices appear to be standard size, about 10 cm by 10 cm, and the thickness is typical for sliced bread toasted. Each slice of toast usually weighs about 25-30 grams. The fromage frais spread is thin to medium thickness, covering the surface but not very thickly. A typical thin spread of fromage frais on a slice this size would weigh approximately 15-20 grams per slice. Since the target food item is the 'toast' itself (bread), I will only estimate the bread weight. Considering both slices together, the total toast weight is about 50-60 grams. For one slice, approximately 27 grams seems reasonable given the visual toasting and size."

The image shows a small green bowl containing 4 strawberries with their green leaves still attached. The strawberries are quite large in size compared to the bowl, which looks like a small dessert or snack bowl. Typical whole strawberries range from 25 to 35 grams each when large, which fits the appearance here. Given that there are four strawberries, and estimating an average of about 30 grams per strawberry due to their large size, the total weight should be around 120 grams. This aligns well with the visual size and typical fresh strawberry weights without overestimating. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the strawberries to be approximately 120 grams."

The ratatouille is visible as a cooked vegetable mix placed on the upper right section of the plate. It appears to consist mainly of diced zucchini, eggplant, tomato, and possibly bell pepper, cooked until soft but still holding shape. The portion covers a moderate area on the plate, not a very thick mound but layered with some depth. Comparing it to the adjacent bulgur, which typically has a more granular and lighter appearance, the ratatouille portion has a denser look but less volume overall. Swiss serving sizes for cooked vegetables range from about 120 to 250 grams. Given the moderate portion size here—not overly heaped but a generous side serving—I estimate the ratatouille weighs in the middle of this range. Also, considering that ratatouille has relatively high water content and some volume lost during cooking, and this portion spreads over roughly a quarter of the plate's surface, I assess it to be around 160 to 180 grams. Final estimation: approximately 170 grams."

Considering the bowl size and the visible quantity compared to the dalh lentils portion on the other side, the rice's weight is likely in the medium range, neither very small nor large. Therefore, I estimate the cooked rice to weigh about 160 grams, which fits visual evidence and portion size guidelines."

The image shows a typical small container of flavored yogurt, specifically fig-flavored without added sugar. The container appears to be a standard single-serving size commonly found in Swiss supermarkets like Migros, which usually range between 100g and 150g for individual yogurt pots. Given that the container is nearly full and the portion size is consistent with typical yogurt servings in Switzerland, it is reasonable to estimate that the total weight of the 'yogourt figue sans sucre' is close to 125 grams. This estimate aligns with standard yogurt pot sizes and visual inspection of the fill level and container size, as well as common portion sizes for similar products."

The image shows a small, shallow bowl holding a single serving of crème caramel. The dessert fills only the bottom of the bowl and appears to be smooth and creamy with a slight dome shape. Considering the bowl's diameter appears to be around 12-15 cm based on the hand size and visible fingers holding it, the crème caramel portion seems small, roughly 1.5 to 2 cm thick. Crème caramel is a dense custard dessert, so its weight is largely a function of volume. The estimated volume from the image corresponds to approximately 120 to 160 grams of crème caramel. This aligns with a typical Swiss dessert portion size that is not overly large. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the crème caramel in the bowl to be approximately 140 grams."

The tuna is scattered throughout the dish in medium-sized chunks. The container appears to be about 12-15 cm wide and filled to roughly two-thirds of its height with the couscous mixture. Visual inspection suggests the tuna pieces are not dense or very large, but there is a moderate amount dispersed throughout. Given that a typical Swiss meat/fish portion is 120-180g, but here the tuna is part of a mixed dish and clearly constitutes less than a full meat portion, it is likely closer to a small to medium portion. By volume and dispersion, the tuna looks to be roughly a third to half of a standard meat portion, estimating around 60-85 grams. This makes sense given the balance of ingredients and the nature of the dish as a mixed salad."

The 'fromage de brebis/chèvre (2 bouts)' is located on the plate at the bottom left side, consisting of two small pieces of cheese. Both pieces are modest in size, roughly about the size of a large walnut or slightly smaller. Considering the density typical of sheep/goat cheese, and comparing to the size of other cheese portions and the bread slice on the plate, each piece likely weighs between 15-25 grams. Together, the two pieces would weigh approximately 30-50 grams. Given their modest size but solid structure, a reasonable estimate is about 40 grams total.

Typical Swiss portion sizes for corn as a side vegetable range around 120-250 grams, but this portion is visibly smaller than a full serving. Considering the corn's density and volume relative to the plate size and other foods (lettuce salad, broccoli, chickpeas), this portion looks closer to a side accompaniment rather than a full vegetable serving. The pile is roughly comparable in volume to about 2-3 large tablespoons of corn. A typical tablespoon of corn weighs around 15 grams, so 2-3 tablespoons would be approximately 30-45 grams.

Considering the size of the plate and the relative size of other items like the chicken skewers and bread piece, this avocado slice is a typical portion slice, not too small or overly large. Given that a whole medium avocado weighs around 150-200 grams, and a quarter slice would be roughly 40-50 grams, this estimation falls well within reasonable portion sizes. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this avocado slice to be around 45 grams."
r3bub9,croissant au chocolat,81.0,65,16.0,0.13907071574203242,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/r3bub9/dish_media/8c1803d2-590b-472d-9d8a-898649b2ae5f,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a chocolate croissant held in one hand. The croissant appears to be of typical bakery size — approximately 12-14 cm in length and with a visibly flaky, buttery texture. It is partially eaten at the bottom, showing some of the chocolate filling inside. The croissant is in a paper wrapper typical of fresh bakery sales. A typical chocolate croissant in Switzerland weighs between 70 and 90 grams depending on size and ingredients. Given the visible size, texture density, and partial consumption, this croissant likely weighs close to the middle of the range, but since part is bitten off, I estimate its current weight around 65 grams."

The specified food item is 'boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate', which are visible as about nine vegetable meatballs covered with tomato sauce on top of a plate of penne pasta. Each boulelette appears roughly the size of a large walnut, which typically weighs around 30-35 grams each for vegetable meatballs. Given there are nine visible boulettes, the total estimated weight comes to approximately 270-315 grams. Considering these are likely homemade and not overly dense, I estimate a medium portion weight of 300 grams. This is consistent with a typical Swiss serving range for vegetable meatballs as main protein components, which often run from 120 to 180 grams per serving but can be larger if several pieces are served. Since the meatballs are the main protein element here and visibly abundant, a weight around 300 grams is plausible."

The houmous au basilic (basil hummus) is presented in a small glass next to the plate and appears to be a typical purchased product. The quantity visible in the glass is approximately 3 tablespoons or so, forming a small mound. Considering the density of hummus and the size of the glass visible for scale (a small tumbler), this portion likely weighs between 40 and 60 grams. Since it's a side condiment portion rather than a full serving, a medium estimate of 50 grams is reasonable and consistent with typical portion sizes for a dip or spread served with a salad meal."

The sauce is visible as a brown liquid pooling around and somewhat covering the mashed potatoes, meat ragout, and carrots on the plate. The quantity of sauce appears moderate, covering about half of the plate surface without a deep layer. Considering the plate diameter (standard dinner plate of about 24 cm) and the visual thinness of the sauce layer (appears spread thinly around the food), the sauce volume is likely under 100 ml, thus a weight roughly less than 100 grams. Given the typical density of such a sauce close to water but slightly denser, the weight of visible sauce is best estimated between 60 and 90 grams, leaning towards medium portion size in Swiss contexts. Therefore, I estimate approximately 75 grams of sauce on the plate."

The image shows a single peeled carrot placed on a countertop. The carrot appears to be medium-sized, about 12-15 cm in length, with an average thickness typical for peeled carrots. Based on common weights for peeled carrots of this size, and considering that a peeled carrot generally weighs less than an unpeeled one of the same size due to removal of the skin, the weight is likely around 70-90 grams. Given the visible size, I estimate the weight of this peeled carrot to be approximately 80 grams, which aligns with typical medium peeled carrot ranges and the image proportions."

The 'cottage cheese aux herbes' is located at the bottom center of the plate, immediately to the right of the hummous. It appears as a small serving of white curd cheese with visible herbs mixed in. The portion is modest, spread in a small heap about 3-4 cm in diameter and roughly 1-1.5 cm thick. Cottage cheese is relatively light, but dense enough that this visual volume suggests a weight. Given the size compared to other items on the plate, like the cherry tomatoes and the fried egg, the amount looks like a typical side serving rather than a large portion. Swiss portions for cottage cheese side servings usually range from about 50g to 100g, but this is clearly on the smaller side. I estimate a weight range of 40g to 60g for this amount of cottage cheese aux herbes, with a final estimate near the middle at 50 grams. This fits well with the plating context as a small accompaniment, and visually does not look denser or larger than this estimate."

The target food is the 'sauce aux champignons' which consists of cream, garlic, and mushrooms. In the image, the sauce is mixed with mushrooms clearly visible as large pieces dispersed among the pasta. The sauce appears creamy and coats the mushrooms but does not form a separate large volume. The visible mushroom pieces are around 5-7 medium chunks, typical cooked mushroom pieces weighing about 10-15 grams each. The cream and garlic sauce component likely adds some weight but less than the solid mushrooms. Given that the sauce and mushrooms are mixed and occupy a moderate part of the bowl with pasta, the total visible quantity of the sauce with mushrooms should be moderate. Swiss portion sizes for vegetable-based sauces are typically 50-100 grams if served as a side. The cream sauce likely brings some additional weight, but the mushroom solids dominate the mass. Considering the visual volume, sauce coverage, and portion size context, I estimate the total weight of the 'sauce aux champignons' (including both cream and mushrooms) to be around 85 grams. This estimate is consistent with the relative amount of sauce visible compared to the pasta and courgettes gratinée."

The image shows two slices of bread on a white plate, each topped with a spread (one with jam and butter, the other with Nutella and butter). The target food item is 'pain' (bread). Both slices of bread appear to be standard medium slices of a rustic or whole grain loaf, roughly rectangular with a crust around the edges. Each slice looks to be about 1.5-2 cm thick with a typical density and porous texture. A typical slice of bread in Switzerland weighs around 30-40 grams depending on thickness and type. These slices are not overly thick but appear to be reasonably dense. Therefore, for each slice, a weight around 35 grams is plausible. Since the target is one slice of bread, not both combined, I estimate the weight of one slice of bread (pain) here to be approximately 35 grams."

The image shows four small slices of different cheeses placed next to a slice of seeded bread on a white plate. The cheeses are likely the manchego, two types of gruyère, and raclette as described. Each cheese slice is relatively thin and about 3 to 5 cm in length, typical for a cheese tasting portion rather than a full serving. Considering the density of firm cheeses like these, which tends to be around 1 g/cm³, and the size of the slices (thin, about a few cm long and 2-3 cm wide), I estimate each slice weighs roughly between 10-15 grams. With four slices total, the combined weight is approximately 40-60 grams. Since the portion looks moderate but not excessive, I will select a medium estimate within that range, around 50 grams in total for all cheeses shown. This estimate aligns well with typical cheese tasting portions and visual density."

The myrtilles (blueberries) are positioned on the left side of the bowl, next to raspberries and porridge. They appear as whole fresh blueberries, about 12 visible berries. Blueberries typically weigh about 0.8-1g per berry. Given the quantity and usual size, the total weight for these blueberries can be estimated by multiplying 12 berries by approximately 1g each, totaling near 12 grams. The portion is clearly modest and fits the context of a breakfast bowl with porridge and toppings, which aligns well with a small serving of berries as a complement rather than a main fruit component. Thus, the estimated weight of the myrtilles is 12 grams."

The image shows a peeled banana that is about half the length of a typical full-sized banana. Usually, an average whole banana weighs approximately 120-150 grams with skin included. Since this piece is peeled and appears roughly half the length of a complete banana, the weight should be about half of the whole fruit once peeled. Considering that the peel adds some weight, the edible part will be slightly less than half the whole banana’s total weight. Therefore, this peeled half banana likely weighs around 60-70 grams. Based on the visual size and typical banana density, I estimate the weight at 65 grams."

The sauce oignons (onion sauce) is visible over the slices of roast meat ('rôti') on the plate. It appears as a thin, reddish-brown liquid with visible cooked onion slices distributed mainly on top of and around the roast. The sauce layer is thin and relatively sparse, not pooled heavily or filling much space on the plate. Given the limited volume of visible sauce and onion slices, the total weight is likely modest. Considering typical sauce densities and the sauce's extent on the plate over roughly 2-3 slices of meat, I estimate the weight of the sauce oignons to be between 30 and 50 grams. Choosing a reasonable middle estimate to reflect a medium amount of sauce present, I settle on approximately 40 grams."

The target food item is 'pain' (bread), which is the slice of brown bread with Nutella spread on it. The slice appears to be a standard medium-thickness slice of whole grain or multigrain bread, roughly oval in shape. Compared to the spoon and plate size, the bread slice looks typical in size, about 12-13 cm in length and about 9-10 cm in width. The thickness is moderate, likely about 1.5 cm thick. Swiss bread slices typically weigh between 30 and 45 grams depending on type and thickness. Considering this slice is of moderate thickness and size, I estimate it to weigh around 40 grams. The Nutella spread and other items on the plate do not add any weight to the bread itself. Thus, the estimated weight of this slice of bread is 40 grams, within a plausible range for a Swiss portion."

The cervelas is part of the chili on the right side of the plate. It appears as the chunky orange-pink pieces mixed in with kidney beans and sauce. They are cut into medium-sized cubes, and the portion of chili covers about half the plate. Considering the density and volume, and the extent of visible cervelas pieces relative to the sauce and beans, the cervelas portion is moderately sized but not excessive. Swiss meat portions are typically 120-180g; this appears to be in that range but on the smaller side as it is mixed with beans and sauce. Estimating conservatively based on visible chunks and plate coverage, the cervelas amount is around 140 grams."

The peanut butter (purée cacahuète) is visible as a small creamy dollop on the bottom left side of the plate. It appears smooth and dense, with a modest spread area. Comparing the peanut butter to the size of the banana half on the plate and the oatmeal portion helps calibrate volume. A typical tablespoon (about 15 ml) of peanut butter weighs roughly 15-17 grams, and this portion looks close to that size or slightly a little more than a tablespoon. Given the visible volume and the density of peanut butter, the portion likely weighs around 18-22 grams. The peanut butter portion is clearly less than a standard serving spoonful heaped up, so an estimate around 20 grams is reasonable and consistent with the visual evidence without overestimating."

The image shows a single lemon slice (rondelle de citron) floating on the surface of a glass of water. The slice is relatively thin and approximately the diameter of a standard lemon, typically around 6-7 cm. Lemon slices are mostly water and light, with peel and pulp. Estimating thickness around 4-5 mm and considering the density and volume, a single lemon slice usually weighs between 5 to 10 grams. This slice appears fresh and not overly thick, so a mid-value estimate around 7 grams is appropriate. This aligns with typical small citrus slice weights and is consistent with the visual size and context."

The chili is positioned on the right half of the plate and appears as a thick stew with visible chunks of cervelas sausage and kidney beans in a tomato-based sauce. The portion covers roughly half the plate and is moderately piled but not heaped, with discernible pieces rather than a dense mass. The plate is a standard dinner plate, and the chili portion seems about medium sized for a main dish. Considering the density, the amount visible, and comparing it to the pasta next to it which is about a typical portion, this chili portion likely weighs between 170 and 230 grams. Choosing a midpoint to reflect a moderate but full serving, I estimate the chili portion weight to be approximately 200 grams."

The feuilleté sauce tomate in the image is a small puff pastry topped or filled with tomato sauce. It appears small, roughly the size of a small pastry that could fit in the palm of a hand, judging by the texture of the wooden surface and the visible grain that help scale the image. Typical individual small puff pastry appetizers (feuilletés) like this weigh around 20-40 grams. Given its compact but airy structure and visible dryness on edges, this piece looks medium-sized within that range. It does not appear large or heavily filled, so estimating towards the middle of the typical range is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight to be approximately 30 grams, which fits a small to medium individual feuilleté with tomato sauce."

The target food item is 'haricots rouges' (red kidney beans). In the image, they are located on the left side of the plate as a compact pile of roughly half a cup volume. The beans are whole and glistening with some herbs sprinkled on top. Compared to the size of the pasta next to it and the fork and knife to the left, the portion looks modest but substantial. Kidney beans are dense and heavier than many vegetables. A typical cooked serving of red beans in Swiss portions is around 130-180g, but this portion seems smaller than a full main portion and more like a side dish portion. Given the relatively small and controlled volume and density, I estimate the weight to be around 90-110 grams, selecting a medium value of 100g to balance the visual size and density implications."

The target food item is 'vinaigre', which is a liquid, likely appearing as the dressing on top of the salad composed of cucumber, tomato, carrot, pumpkin seeds, and sérac. The vinaigre is visible as a thin layer of dressing with mustard seeds dispersed across the vegetables. As vinaigre is a condiment typically used in small quantities, the visible amount here corresponds to roughly a tablespoon or less, given that it lightly covers the salad but does not pool heavily or fill the bowl. A tablespoon of vinaigre is approximately 15 grams by weight. Considering some dressing dripped partially unevenly over the salad, the vinaigre portion is likely between 10 and 15 grams. Thus, I estimate the vinaigre weight at about 12 grams."

Typically, individual segments of a dark chocolate bar weigh around 10 to 15 grams depending on thickness and size. Given the visible size and thickness of this piece, it is reasonable to estimate a weight slightly below average due to the broken edge. Considering the typical weight of one intact segment and adjusting for the missing portion, the estimated weight is about 9 to 12 grams. Choosing a middle estimate in that range based on visual assessment, the weight of this chocolat noir piece is approximately 10 grams."

Considering the typical density of muesli (a mix of oats, grains, and nuts) and the volume it occupies in this medium-sized bowl, the portion seems to be slightly less than a full large serving. Swiss reference portions for muesli commonly range around 40-60g per serving. Judging by the volume and typical serving sizes, the visible amount of muesli here is roughly 55-65 grams. I estimate the weight of the muesli nature in this bowl at about 60 grams, balancing between the packed volume and typical portion sizes. This estimate excludes the yogurt portion, which is specifically not requested."

The specified food item is 'oignon' (onion), which is visible as small chopped green onion pieces sprinkled on top of the ham on the bread slice. The amount of onion is quite small, scattered as garnish rather than a main ingredient. The chopped pieces cover a small surface area and appear thin and light. Given that green onions are light and the visible quantity is sparse—roughly estimated around one tablespoon or less—the weight is likely quite low. A tablespoon of chopped green onion typically weighs about 10-15 grams. In this case, due to the light sprinkling and partial coverage, the weight is likely closer to the lower end or slightly below that. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the visible chopped onions to be approximately 8 grams."

The target food item is 'graines de chia', chia seeds, visible in the bowl mixed with blanc battu, flocons d'avoine, and miel. Visually, the chia seeds are dispersed and not densely piled; they appear as many small black dots throughout the mixture. Considering the typical amount of chia seeds mixed in such preparations (often 1-2 tablespoons), and observing the distribution and volume relative to the other components, the chia seeds likely weigh in the range of 10-20 grams. Since the mixture fills a medium-sized bowl and the chia seeds are a minor but noticeable component, I estimate the quantity to be roughly 15 grams. This is consistent with typical portion use for chia seeds as a small but nutritive addition, and visually fits the spread and concentration seen."
m4egh2,sauce curry avec mayonnaise,18.0,25,7.0,0.013520764030475373,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/40709ed3-1ed0-49ed-89e9-67c7e3184f7f,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two sandwiches containing pieces of chicken, green lettuce, and a yellow curry-mayonnaise sauce spread inside a baguette-style bread. Since the target food is 'sauce curry avec mayonnaise,' the focus is on the sauce portion visible on the bread surfaces. The sauce appears as a thin, uneven layer spread mainly on the bottom bread halves of both sandwiches, covering moderate surface area but with low thickness. Given that curry mayonnaise sauces are relatively dense liquids but generally used sparingly as a condiment, the visible amount corresponds to around 10-15 grams per sandwich, totaling roughly 20-30 grams for both sandwiches combined. However, since the instruction is to estimate for the food item in the image, and two sandwiches are on the plate, it's reasonable to assume the total sauce amount visible on both sandwiches combined is the serving. Taking a mid-value estimate, I conclude the total weight of the 'sauce curry avec mayonnaise' in this image is approximately 25 grams."

The target food is 'mayonnaise thomy', which is placed in the upper left corner of the white plate, next to the white asparagus. It appears as a small dollop of creamy mayonnaise. Comparing it to the size of the asparagus spears, which are about standard thickness and length, the mayonnaise portion is small to moderate, likely about a tablespoon or slightly less. Typical condiment tablespoon servings weigh around 15 grams. Given the visual size and spread, the mayonnaise quantity seems consistent with about that weight and not more. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the mayonnaise thomy to be approximately 15 grams."

The image shows a hand holding multiple cashew nuts (noix de cajou). Cashew nuts typically weigh about 1.3 to 1.5 grams each depending on size. By counting, there are approximately 18 visible cashews in the hand. Multiplying the average weight (around 1.4 grams) by the number of nuts gives about 25 grams. The nuts appear to be of average size and the hand is moderately filled, confirming this estimation. This weight aligns well with typical small snack portions of cashew nuts. Therefore, the estimated weight of the noix de cajou in the hand is approximately 25 grams."

The image shows a small piece of bread ('pain') topped with chestnut cream spread ('crème de marrons'). The piece of bread looks to be roughly 8-10 cm in length, with a typical density and crumb structure for French bread. Bread weight for this size piece would likely be around 25-30 grams. The chestnut cream spread is visibly applied evenly but in a thin layer, covering nearly the entire surface of the bread piece. Considering the glossy, dense texture of the chestnut cream and the coverage, the cream layer likely adds around 15-20 grams. Combining these, the total weight of the 'crème de marrons' visible as the spread itself (excluding the bread) is roughly in the 15-20 grams range. Given that the target food item is 'crème de marrons' alone, and judging by the volume and thickness of the spread, an estimate of 18 grams is reasonable and plausible."

The image shows a small white bowl containing various salad ingredients with a visible drizzle of vinaigre balsamique (balsamic vinegar). The vinaigre balsamique is a liquid, which appears spread as a thin layer over the salad components and coating the bowl sides. Considering the volume and liquid nature of vinaigre balsamique, a small amount like this typically ranges around 10 to 30 grams per serving, depending on the amount poured. In this case, the amount is moderate, neither a thin splash nor a heavy pour. Visually, the quantity looks closer to about 15-20 grams of vinaigre balsamique within the bowl, based on typical vinegar density and volume coverage. Therefore, I estimate the vinaigre balsamique weight as approximately 18 grams."

The image shows a piece of 'pain aux fruits' being held between the fingers, suggesting it is relatively small. The bread has a dense texture visible through the crust with pieces of fruit and nuts embedded. The shape and size fit roughly a small hand-held portion, approximately 7-8 cm in width and about 3-4 cm thick. Typical fruit breads of this size weigh between 80-120 grams depending on density and moisture. Given that the bread appears relatively dense and thick with nuts and dried fruit, I estimate it toward the medium range within this band. Therefore, the estimated weight of the pain aux fruits is approximately 95 grams."

The avocado is located on the upper right side of the galette wrap, cut into two medium-thick slices. Each slice appears to be about one-fifth to one-quarter of a typical avocado half. Given that a medium avocado usually weighs around 150-200 grams in total (including skin and seed), the edible portion per half would be about 120-150 grams. Here, we see roughly half of one half (one quarter of the whole avocado) in slices, which visually corresponds to around 30-40 grams. The avocado volume is consistent with this range compared to the other ingredients such as the carrot and tomato slices. The portion looks moderate and typical for a wrap serving. Thus, I estimate the avocado weight to be about 35 grams, which fits well within typical portion sizes without overestimating."

The image shows a small amount of green salad leaves with some visible sauce residue on a large white plate. The lettuce appears to be torn into irregular pieces and is spread loosely, occupying only a small central area on the plate. Considering the low density of lettuce, its light weight, and the small quantity visible (only a few leaves), this portion is significantly smaller than a typical full side portion of salad (normally 120-250g in Swiss portions). Visually, this amount corresponds roughly to what might be left over or a very small side portion, likely around 10 to 20 grams. Given the size and density of the leaves and their volume on the plate, an estimate around 15 grams is reasonable and consistent with the visual evidence."

The image shows two small chocolate figures shaped like rabbits. They are solid and have moderate thickness. Given their size relative to the texture and pattern of the placemat and table surface, each chocolate rabbit seems to be roughly the size of a small chocolate figurine commonly found as Easter treats in Switzerland. Such chocolates typically weigh about 20-25 grams each. Since the request is for the weight of one chocolat piece, I estimate it to be around 22 grams, which aligns well with the physical size and typical densities of solid milk chocolate."

The target food item is 'graines de courge' (pumpkin seeds). They are visible scattered throughout the couscous mixture in the glass container. The seeds appear sporadically in moderate quantity but do not form a dense bulk. Given the volume they occupy and their small size, combined with the amount visible against the couscous and cucumber pieces, the total weight of the pumpkin seeds is likely low but measurable. A typical small handful of pumpkin seeds weighs about 10-20 grams. Considering the scattered distribution and mixed nature of the dish, the visible pumpkin seeds here probably amount to around 15-20 grams. This aligns with the volume seen relative to the portions of couscous and tuna in the container, and pumpkin seeds are dense but small. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'graines de courge' to be approximately 18 grams."

The image shows a single tartine (slice of bread) with a spread of chestnut cream (crème de marrons) and butter. The bread slice appears to be a small to medium-sized thin slice, roughly about 10-12 cm in length and about 6-7 cm in width. The bread is toasted, which slightly reduces water content and weight. Typically, such a slice of bread weighs around 25-30 grams when toasted. The visible layer of butter is light and partially spread, likely around 5 grams. The chestnut cream spread appears moderate, roughly double the quantity of butter in volume, and chestnut cream is denser than butter. Estimating around 10 grams for the chestnut cream layer seems reasonable. Adding these components together: bread ~28g + butter ~5g + chestnut cream ~10g = approximately 43 grams. The spread covers much of the slice but is not very thick. Considering some margin, the total weight of the tartine with crème de marrons et beurre is likely between 40 and 50 grams, with a final estimate of 45 grams to reflect a medium portion. This aligns well with the visual size and density observed in the image."

The 'perle de blé' here are the small, round, pearl-like grains visible mixed with the shrimp and sauce at the bottom left section of the bowl. The grains are cooked and mixed with the creamy saffron sauce, and occupy about one third of the bowl's volume, alongside the shrimp and fresh green beans. Considering the typical serving size for grain side dishes like 'perle de blé' (similar to pearl couscous), a Swiss portion ranges roughly from 100g to 170g cooked. Visually, the portion seems slightly less than a full serving because the bowl also contains sizable portions of shrimp and green beans. Therefore, estimating the weight towards the lower to medium side of the reference range is reasonable. I estimate the weight of the 'perle de blé' here to be around 130 to 150 grams. Considering the density and the visible amount in the bowl, a final estimate is 140 grams."

The mayonnaise is clearly visible on the plate as a single dollop placed on the left side. The portion appears to be a moderate serving size commonly used as a condiment, and it does not spread widely but forms a thick swirl. Considering typical condiment servings and visual comparison with the other items on the plate (tortilla, sautéed aubergines, and Russian salad), the mayonnaise portion looks to be around 25-35 grams. Given the volume and density of mayonnaise, this estimation fits a small to medium serving dollop that matches the visual evidence."

The specified item is ""oeuf au plat"" (fried egg). The egg is fully visible on the plate, located at the bottom left. It appears to be a standard large egg with a firm white and a soft yolk, sprinkled with some seasoning. Typical large chicken eggs weigh about 50-60 grams raw. Cooking increases water loss slightly but does not significantly reduce weight. Visually, the egg white and yolk spread cover a reasonable plate area, consistent with a single full egg. There are no signs of it being cut or otherwise missing parts. Given the size relative to the other items on the plate (cherry tomatoes, bulgur, and feta), this looks like one standard fried egg portion. Swiss portion sizes for a fried egg typically align with the raw egg weight, about 50 grams. Considering minor water loss during cooking, a small adjustment downward to around 48 grams is reasonable, but 50 grams remains a good estimate. Therefore, the weight of the oeuf au plat on this plate is estimated at 50 grams."

The galette wrap is fully visible in the image and clearly laid flat on the plate. It appears to be a standard wheat-based wrap, about 25-30 cm in diameter. Standard galette wraps are thin and weigh less than a typical tortilla due to their size and density. Based on known data and visual assessment, a standard galette wrap usually weighs between 60 and 70 grams. Here, it looks neither unusually thick nor thin and has no visible damage or missing parts. Considering this and its size compared to the fork and plate, I estimate the galette wrap's weight is approximately 65 grams."

The image shows a single whole pear ('poire') being held in one hand, which gives a clear scale reference. The pear appears to be of medium size with a typical elongated shape and moderate thickness. Pears generally weigh between 150g and 300g depending on size. Given the visible dimensions relative to the hand and the absence of any indication that this is a particularly large or small pear, it is likely to be in the mid-range of typical pear weights. Therefore, an estimate around 180 to 220 grams is plausible. I choose a final estimate close to the middle of this range, 200 grams, to reflect a medium-sized fresh pear."
