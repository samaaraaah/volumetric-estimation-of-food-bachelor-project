wrah5h,"délice des dieux (biscuit, fruits rouges, séré+mascarpone)",325.0,135,190.0,7.305963085660199,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/560d1e28-3692-4e4d-bdaf-3abb5f44be7a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a portion of délice des dieux, a layered dessert composed of biscuit base, mixed red fruits, and a creamy layer of séré plus mascarpone. Step 1: The dessert piece is square-shaped with visible raspberries on top and berries embedded in the creamy layer. There are three whole raspberries on top. Step 2: The piece is on a standard-sized small dessert plate (roughly 20-22 cm diameter), the slice appears about 8-9 cm wide and 6-7 cm deep, with a thickness of approximately 3-4 cm. Step 3: The biscuit base is dense but thin, likely around 0.5 cm thick. The creamy layer is thick and sandwiched between fruit layers. Cream plus séré tends to be dense but lighter than firm cheese, and the fruits add density and moisture. Step 4: Taking into account the density of the biscuit and the creamy fruit layers, and typical Swiss dessert portion sizes (smaller than US), the slice corresponds roughly to about 120-150 grams in total. Given the thickness and visual density, I estimate around the middle of this range. Step 5: This is a single serving dessert piece, not overly large, so 135 grams is a reasonable weight considering all factors."
p96w4a,croissants au jambon,37.0,190,153.0,0.6697823000473261,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/7bd6e67d-b1ca-42e4-a5ca-713b7fadda27,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two croissants au jambon on the plate, located at the top left. Both croissants appear to be medium-sized, typical Swiss portions which are slightly smaller than US portions. They are puff pastry croissants filled with ham. Each croissant is roughly 8-10 cm long and has a dense, buttery pastry exterior with a thin filling inside. Considering the density of the croissant dough and the ham filling, an individual croissant au jambon usually weighs between 80-110 grams in a Swiss context. Since there are two croissants, the total weight would be about 160-220 grams. Taking a midpoint and accounting for slightly smaller size, I estimate the combined weight of the two croissants au jambon at approximately 190 grams."
2ahgvr,porridge salé,48.0,185,137.0,0.7780407004259347,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a35f3211-3b33-4826-97b8-3af69655dada,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: The target food item is 'porridge salé' contained in a small glass jar with a metal lid. The jar is approximately 7 cm in diameter, based on lid measurement markings. Step 2: The porridge fills about 70-75% of the jar's total height. The jar is roughly 6-7 cm tall, so the porridge height is around 4.5-5 cm. Considering the diameter of 7 cm, the volume of porridge is roughly a cylinder volume calculation: π * (3.5 cm)^2 * 4.75 cm ≈ 183 cm³. Step 3: Porridge (oatmeal) consistency is dense and thick, so density approximates to about 1 g/cm³ to slightly less. For savory porridge that is creamy but thick, density is close to 1 g/cm³. Step 4: Thus, the estimated weight is close to the volume, around 180-190 grams. Considering some air pockets and slight variations, a medium portion would be about 185 grams. Step 5: No visible lid or container weight included, only the porridge itself is estimated. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'porridge salé' portion is 185 grams."
6fwmw2,mélange de porc et légumes façon thaï,295.0,180,115.0,4.0138428774254615,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/6fwmw2/dish_media/ec6d03db-ac9d-4ca2-92e1-96ab989361cb,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'mélange de porc et légumes façon thaï', which is the mixture of pork and vegetables on top of the rice noodles in the bowl. Visually, the mixture covers a substantial portion of the bowl's surface and appears moderately thick with visible chunks of pork, broccoli, carrots, bell peppers, and mushrooms. The portion seems to be medium-sized, not overflowing the bowl but sufficient for a single meal. Comparing the size to the bowl (a typical medium bowl about 15-18 cm diameter) and considering the density of cooked pork combined with the vegetables, which are dense and moist but lighter than meat, the volume can be estimated roughly as 1.5 to 2 cm in thickness over an area about two-thirds the bowl's surface. This translates to a volume roughly around 150-200 ml. Since pork and vegetables have densities close to 1 g/ml, the approximate weight is close to the volume in grams. Taking into account some sauce, which can add weight, but also some air gaps, I estimate the portion weight at about 180 grams."
p8a2w5,sandwich bahn mi au bœuf,313.0,200,113.0,4.184690014197823,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/022d6625-56d2-43cd-a1e0-77ae2cf08703,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single sandwich bánh mì au bœuf. Visually, the sandwich is about 20 cm long, typical for a small to medium-sized Swiss portion. The bread is a crusty baguette, which generally weighs around 80-100 grams for this size. Inside the sandwich, there are visible thin slices of cucumber, some leafy greens likely cilantro, some thin carrot strips, and thin slices of white radish. The beef is not clearly visible but presumably layered beneath the vegetables and not in a very thick layer, typical for this type of sandwich from a street-style perspective. The beef portion is likely lean and sliced thinly, contributing to moderate density inside. Considering the density of cooked beef and the visible volume inside, the beef would likely weigh around 60-80 grams. The vegetables add minor weight but are mostly light. Since the target is the whole sandwich, the total weight would be primarily from the baguette plus the beef and vegetables. Adding up approximately 90 grams for the bread, 70 grams for the beef, and about 40 grams for fresh vegetables and condiments, the total weight is around 200 grams. Given the Swiss portion context, and the visual fullness of the sandwich, estimating approximately 200 grams is reasonable and conservative."
r3bub9,millet,201.0,110,91.0,2.1641031708471368,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/r3bub9/dish_media/caf038e8-cc51-41c3-ae34-63959a1e6ad6,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with millet on the right side and a creamy meat dish on the left. Step 1: The millet is clearly visible as a mound of cooked grains shaped in a loose pile. It is not mixed or layered but piled. Step 2: The plate provides a size reference; standard plates are around 25 cm across. The millet pile is roughly one third of the plate's surface, suggesting a moderate portion. The millet grains are fluffy but dense, suggesting some depth, estimated around 2-3 cm. Step 3: Cooked millet is grain-like and dense when cooked, similar to cooked couscous or quinoa, with a density around 0.9 g/cm³. Step 4: Estimating the mound volume approximately as a half-oval: about 12 cm length, 8 cm width, 2.5 cm height = approx 120 cm³ volume, leading to around 108 grams. Given Swiss portion sizes tend to be moderate, this appears a medium portion. Step 5: Cross-validating with typical cooked millet serving sizes (80-130 g) and the visual volume, the estimate of about 110 grams fits well. Therefore, the estimated weight of the cooked millet on the plate is approximately 110 grams."
wrah5h,omelette aux tomates,209.0,120,89.0,2.200780880265026,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/c4d2e0f7-71f7-4e23-bc37-43a0aff738da,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two triangular portions of omelette aux tomates on a medium-sized plate, along with a slice of bread (not to be estimated). Step 1: Visual Identification - The omelette aux tomates is composed of egg mixture with visible chunks of tomato evenly distributed. There are two pieces present. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each omelette piece appears roughly 10 cm in length and 5-6 cm in width at the widest part. Thickness looks around 1.5-2 cm. Combined, the omelette covers about half the plate surface. Step 3: Density Considerations - Omelettes are moderately dense due to eggs; tomatoes add some moisture and volume but are lighter. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - A regular Swiss portion omelette portion usually ranges from 90-140 grams for about two-thirds of a standard omelette. Given the amount shown, the two pieces together appear to be a single serving (medium portion) approximately 110-130 grams. Step 5: Cross Validation - The amount of tomato visible is moderate, not excessive. The plate size and bread slice reinforce that this portion is medium-sized. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the omelette aux tomates to be approximately 120 grams."
m4egh2,panais,13.0,95,82.0,0.1261239943208708,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/c31013e3-9c81-4ba6-b85b-e3c45b062457,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a mixed vegetable dish with visibly identifiable pieces of panais (parsnip) along with pommes de terre, fêta, carottes, aubergines, and racines rouges. Step 1: Visual identification shows about 4-5 pieces of panais, cut in small to medium chunks, scattered throughout the pile. Step 2: Each piece of panais is roughly 3-4 cm long, with a thickness about 1-1.5 cm, giving moderate volume. Compared to the plate size and fork nearby, these are fairly small pieces. Step 3: Panais, a root vegetable, is dense but slightly less dense than potatoes. Given the compact shape and multiple pieces, the total volume suggests a reasonable weight. Step 4: Using Swiss portion context and knowing root vegetables are quite dense and heavy for size, the total weight for the 4-5 panais pieces is estimated between 80 and 110 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation avoids underestimating the density and volume hidden in overlaps, so I choose a middle-range estimate of 95 grams as a reasonable portion of panais on the plate."
ppf8hc,pâte à tartiner au chocolat,20.0,100,80.0,0.18930430667297682,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/bb3c4df3-02a6-4c3c-ba00-f82398617f07,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'pâte à tartiner au chocolat' spread on three slices of tresse au beurre bread on a small plate. Step 1: I identified the chocolate spread covering almost the entire upper surface of each slice. Step 2: The slices appear standard size for Swiss portions, about 10-12 cm long and 4-5 cm wide, with the spread thickness consistent and moderate, roughly 2-3 mm deep as typical for chocolate spread. Step 3: Chocolate spread is dense but spread thinly; thus, the weight is more than a thin smear but less than a thick layer. Step 4: The total surface area covered approximates to around 350 cm² (sum of three slices). Given an estimated average density of chocolate spread at about 1.2 g/cm³ and thickness of 0.2-0.3 cm, the volume is around 70-105 cm³, corresponding to approximately 84-126 grams. Step 5: Considering the spread is moderately thick and an uneven spread, and Swiss portions tend to be small, a reasonable weight estimate is around 100 grams. Therefore, the total chocolate spread on the three bread pieces is approximately 100 grams."
p8a2w5,boeuf,47.0,115,68.0,0.37813535257927117,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/c9125670-8a67-4884-9958-ce18c6ccbe72,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate containing four main components: lettuce leaves (salade), a sausage piece (saucisse), a chicken skewer (poulet), and a beef skewer (boeuf). The beef skewer is the target item and is positioned at the top right of the plate. It consists of several chunks of grilled beef on a wooden skewer. Counting the beef pieces, there are about 5 medium-sized chunks, none partially hidden. Using the plate diameter and the hand holding it for scale, each beef chunk likely measures around 3-4 cm in length and about 2-3 cm in width/height, indicating moderate thickness. Beef is dense, so the volume corresponds to a relatively high weight. Since this is a typical Swiss portion (smaller than US), and the skewer size is moderate, I estimate each beef chunk to weigh between 20-25 grams. Multiplying by 5 pieces gives a total range of 100-125 grams. Given this is a modest grilled portion on a small plate, the estimate near the middle of this range is most reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the beef (boeuf) skewer to be approximately 115 grams."
ppf8hc,pain,106.0,40,66.0,0.8277330809275911,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/5495e975-cddc-4f5d-b496-a3e51d50cf86,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows three pieces of seeded bread ('pain'), each spread with chocolate spread. Step 1: Visual Identification - the bread slices are individually visible and clearly defined without obvious overlapping. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - each slice appears to be a small to medium Swiss bread slice, roughly 10 cm long and 5-6 cm wide, with a typical thickness of about 2-3 cm. The crust is visible with seeds, indicating a dense, grainy bread which tends to be heavier than plain white bread. Step 3: Density Consideration - seeded bread has a density around 0.35 to 0.4 g/cm³. Considering the size and thickness, each slice likely weighs between 35 and 45 grams approximately. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - since these are relatively small slices and three pieces are shown, the target is one slice, so a medium portion is about 40 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - the bread is not overly thick or thin, and considering Swiss portion sizes tend to be smaller, 40 grams per slice is reasonable and fits typical estimates for this type of bread. Therefore, the estimated weight of one 'pain' slice is 40 grams."

The image shows a plate with a sausage ('saucisse'), duck breast slices ('filet de canard'), carrot salad ('salade de carottes'), and pasta salad ('salade de pâtes'). The sausage is the target food item. Visually, it is one whole piece, about the length of the width of the plate's central section (estimated about 10 cm long), and appears cooked with a slight charring. Typical Swiss sausage portions are smaller than US ones, weighing around 80-100 grams. This sausage looks dense and compact, slightly smaller than average, so closer to a medium portion. Considering its length, thickness, and typical density of cooked pork sausage, I estimate its weight to be approximately 95 grams."

Step 1: The target food item is 'fraise' (strawberry). In the image, there are several sliced strawberries arranged around a scoop of vanilla ice cream with dollops of whipped cream. Step 2: The strawberries appear sliced into small pieces, roughly 10-12 visible slices. Given the size relative to the ice cream scoop and the bowl, each slice is about 2-3 cm long. Step 3: Strawberries are moderately dense and contain water, so weight corresponds reasonably with volume. Step 4: A medium strawberry weighs approximately 12-15 grams, and the slices shown look to be around 1.5-2 medium strawberries worth in total. Step 5: Accounting for the slicing and slight moisture from the ice cream, I estimate the total weight of the strawberry slices to be in the range of 25 to 30 grams. Considering Swiss portions tend to be smaller, I place my estimate slightly lower within that range. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'fraise' is approximately 27 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread ('pain') on a white plate, each slice spread with different toppings. The slices are medium size, roughly equivalent to a typical Swiss bread roll cut in half. Each piece has a crust and a soft inner part. Based on the size comparison to the butter knife handle beside the plate and the typical weight of such bread rolls in Switzerland, each half slice weighs approximately 40-50 grams. Both slices together seem to approximate the weight of one full roll, near 80-100 grams. Since the target is 'pain', and this includes both visible slices, I estimate the total weight of bread to be around 90 grams."

The target food item is 'filet de canard'. Visually, the duck fillet is located at the top right center of the plate, and it is cut into two distinct pieces. I count two pieces of duck filet. For size reference, the plate diameter is likely around 24 cm (standard dinner plate). Each duck filet piece is roughly 8-9 cm long, 4-5 cm wide, and about 1-1.5 cm thick. Duck breast meat is dense, with skin and fat visible. Typical duck breast portion in Swiss servings is smaller than in US servings, and a whole portion usually ranges between 120-150 grams. Here, the two pieces combined appear to represent a moderately sized Swiss portion, not oversized. Given the thickness and density of cooked duck, each piece likely weighs approximately 65-70 grams, totaling around 130-140 grams. Considering the lean meat plus skin and some cooking shrinkage, I estimate the 'filet de canard' on this plate weighs approximately 135 grams."

The image shows a small white plate with a pile of blueberries ('myrtilles'). I counted approximately 45 individual blueberries. Each blueberry typically weighs about 1 to 1.3 grams, depending on size. These blueberries appear medium-sized, not overly large or small. Considering the density and natural variation, using 1.1 grams per berry is a conservative estimate. The pile does not appear deeply layered, so minimal hidden volume is assumed. Multiplying 45 berries by 1.1 grams gives about 50 grams. This conforms with Swiss portion sizes, which tend to be moderate. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the myrtilles to be 50 grams."
ppf8hc,gâche,62.0,115,53.0,0.3887837198296261,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/f697ce48-4742-4e58-a44b-67e563c6653a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two slices of gâche bread, both spread with chocolate pâte à tartiner. I will focus only on the gâche. Each slice appears to be about standard sandwich bread size but slightly thicker than regular white bread, typical of gâche, which is richer and denser. By comparing the bread slices to the nearby glass of juice and keys as size references, each slice is roughly 10 cm x 10 cm and about 1.5 cm thick. Gâche is denser and slightly heavier than regular bread, with a typical density around 0.35-0.40 g/cm³. Calculating the volume per slice: 10 cm x 10 cm x 1.5 cm = 150 cm³. Considering the density, each slice should weigh approximately 150 x 0.38 = 57 grams. Both slices together weigh around 115 grams in total. Since the target is the gâche (presumably both slices combined), I estimate the total gâche weight at approximately 115 grams, assuming the slices are not heavily compressed or overly thick."
p8a2w5,chips,27.0,80,53.0,0.16930903928064364,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/2f23dc6a-6f01-46a7-a4fd-623e4f92c1ea,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a white bowl filled with light, airy chips that appear to be puffed corn or similar snack. The bowl size is relatively standard, approximately 15 cm in diameter, and the chips fill about half to two-thirds of the bowl's volume. These chips are low density, as indicated by their puffed and porous structure, meaning their volume appears larger relative to their weight. Estimating the volume of chips to be about 250-300 ml in the bowl, and knowing that such puffed chips generally weigh about 0.3 g/ml, the weight is likely around 75 to 90 grams. Considering the portion size looks medium and consistent with Swiss snack portions, I estimate the weight of the chips in the bowl to be approximately 80 grams."
wrah5h,haricots rouges,91.0,39,52.0,0.559867486985329,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1550c506-8c95-461f-b658-8f427dc2a0af,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'haricots rouges' (red kidney beans), which are located on the left side of the plate. Step 1: Visual Identification: The red kidney beans are clearly separated from the other items (pasta in the center and green cooked vegetables on the right). The beans appear whole and separate, with a total visible count roughly around 40 beans. Step 2: Dimension Analysis: Each kidney bean is about 2-3 cm long, roughly a typical size, and the pile is moderately deep, likely about 1-1.5 cm thick. Compared to the plate and the pasta portion, the beans form a small to medium serving. Step 3: Density Considerations: Cooked kidney beans are dense and heavy relative to volume. A standard cooked kidney bean weighs about 0.8-1 gram. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration: With about 40 beans, estimating average 0.9 gram per bean, total weight would be around 36 grams. Considering some beans may be under or over count and hidden depth, adding a margin up to 20%, yields roughly 35-43 grams, so a medium portion of 39 grams is reasonable. Step 5: Cross-validation: The amount looks smaller than a typical 100 g can portion because the plate isn't overloaded, consistent with Swiss portion norms. Therefore, the estimate is appropriate and conservative."
p96w4a,mousse au chocolat,79.0,130,51.0,0.4766919072408897,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/a2817797-57d1-4c81-9361-842a43ba541f,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single mousse au chocolat dessert placed on a small plate with a fork for scale. The mousse appears cylindrical, about 7-8 cm in diameter and approximately 4-5 cm in height. The mousse texture is typical—light and airy but compact. Compared to the fork width (about 2 cm per tine), the mousse's size suggests a small individual portion. Given the volume approximated as a cylinder (diameter ~7.5 cm, height ~4.5 cm), the volume is about 200 cm³. Considering mousse density is somewhat lower than water due to air content, estimated at around 0.6-0.7 g/cm³, the weight should be around 120-140 grams. Since this is a Swiss context where portions tend to be moderate, I estimate this mousse au chocolat to weigh approximately 130 grams."

The image shows a rectangular plastic container filled partially with salade grecque, recognizable by its mix of diced cucumbers, tomatoes, yellow and green peppers, black olives, onions, and small chunks of white feta cheese. The mixture is chopped into small, uniform pieces, typical for a Greek salad, and appears to be lightly coated with a dressing. The container is approximately the size of a common lunchbox container, roughly 15 cm long, 10 cm wide, and the salad fills about half its height, estimating visible salad depth around 4-5 cm. Given the density of the vegetables (cucumber, peppers, tomato) and cheese, and accounting for the space between pieces, the density is moderate. The salad looks fresh and moist, but not overly compacted. Considering Swiss portion sizes are smaller than US, this portion seems medium-sized. Estimating volume roughly at 15 cm x 10 cm x 4.5 cm = 675 cm³, and taking an average salad density of about 0.5 to 0.6 g/cm³ for chopped fresh salad with cheese, the weight likely lies between 330 g and 400 g. Given the container is not fully filled and the salad is loosely packed, I estimate the weight closer to the middle of that range. Therefore, I estimate the salade grecque portion shown in this container to weigh approximately 365 grams."

The brochette de boeuf is visually identified as three sizable chunks of beef on a skewer placed at the top center of the plate. Each beef piece appears roughly 3-4 cm long, about 2.5 cm wide, and moderately thick, suggesting a dense and compact cut of grilled beef. Comparing its size to the bread piece and the pasta salad, the total volume is moderate—typical for a single serving in a Swiss meal. Beef density is relatively high, about 1.0-1.1 g/cm³. Based on visual proportions, the skewer pieces together correspond roughly to a weight range of 110-140 grams. Considering the visible size without underestimating the thickness and density of the cooked beef, a conservative estimate for the brochette de boeuf weight would be around 125 grams."

The image shows a rectangular container divided roughly into three parts: the top contains mozzarella, the middle sliced tomatoes, and the bottom cooked millet. Focusing on the mozzarella, which is the target food item, there are about 8 to 10 irregular chunks of white mozzarella visible. Each piece looks roughly 2-3 cm in size with some thickness, appearing to be fresh mozzarella cut into pieces. Comparing the size to the container, which seems like a small lunchbox roughly 15cm by 10cm, the mozzarella occupies about one third of the container’s length and nearly half the width. Considering typical density of fresh mozzarella (density around 0.9g/cm3) and estimating volume by surface area times depth (approx. 4cm x 7cm and depth about 1.5cm for piled pieces), the total volume is about 42 cm3. Multiplying volume by density gives an approximate weight of 38 grams. Given some variability in piece size and packing density, a reasonable estimate would be in the range of 35 to 45 grams. Considering portion sizes in Swiss context, this is a medium-small portion. Therefore, I estimate the mozzarella weight at approximately 40 grams."
wrah5h,salade verte + sauce blanche,97.0,50,47.0,0.5393989588263133,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/e70834e6-948f-4497-a162-e7f604b1b041,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small bowl containing a green salad with some white sauce. The salad consists mainly of leafy greens such as lettuce and arugula, which are light and sparse. I count roughly 8-10 visible leaves or leaf clusters. The bowl is relatively small, and the salad does not appear densely packed, showing some spaces between leaves. The sauce is lightly coating the leaves, adding some minor weight but not a significant volume. Considering the size of the bowl compared to the plate underneath, I estimate the salad volume to be about 150-200 ml. Leafy greens are light, with a density roughly around 0.2 to 0.3 g/ml when dressed lightly. The added sauce likely increases density slightly. Thus, my weight estimation for the salad including the sauce is in the range of about 40-60 grams. Given the visual hull and Swiss portion size standards, I estimate on the conservative medium side approximately 50 grams."
p96w4a,tarte à la rhubarbe,105.0,150,45.0,0.5590392806436346,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/e0c92380-fc15-4bbe-90fb-cc2936321050,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single slice of rhubarb tart on a white plate, alongside a fork and a knife for size reference. The slice appears to be roughly one-eighth of a standard homemade tart, with a pastry crust, an egg-based custard filling, and visible chunks of cooked rhubarb on top. The rhubarb pieces are moderately dense but softened from cooking, and they cover the surface but do not form a very thick layer. The crust is thin but firm, and overall the slice is relatively flat. Comparing to the knife length (about 20 cm) and plate size (typical small Swiss plate about 22-24 cm diameter), the slice measures roughly 12 cm along the longest edge and about 6-7 cm wide. The average depth of the slice including crust and filling is about 1.5-2 cm. Given these dimensions, and bearing in mind that rhubarb is watery but the custard and crust add density, a typical weight for such a portion would be around 140-160 grams. As this slice looks neither very thick nor overly large, and Swiss portions tend to be moderate, a reasonable estimate is about 150 grams total weight for the slice. Since the tart's main ingredient is rhubarb topping on pastry, and the rhubarb does not overwhelmingly increase the density beyond the custard base, this estimate aligns well with visual evidence combined with standard portion characteristics."

The image shows a single whole kiwi with its brown, hairy skin intact. For size reference, the kiwi is about the size of a small fist or a large egg, which is typical for a standard kiwi fruit. Considering the typical density and water content of kiwi (which is mostly water and pulp), the average weight of a single medium-sized kiwi is approximately 70-80 grams. There are no visible signs of the fruit being cut or reduced in size. Given the Swiss portion standards tend to be slightly smaller than US portions but this kiwi looks of average size, I estimate the weight to be around 75 grams."

The image shows a half apple ('pomme') held in an adult hand, providing a clear size reference. The apple half is about the width of the palm, indicating a medium-sized apple. Apples are dense fruits with an average density close to water, typically around 0.8 grams per cubic centimeter. Considering this half shows the full depth and width of the fruit, the whole apple would be roughly twice this volume. A medium apple in Swiss portion context usually weighs between 130-180 grams. Since this is a half apple, the visible portion should weigh about 65-90 grams. The apple seems fresh and quite dense, without any missing pieces or hollow parts that would reduce weight. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this half apple to be approximately 80 grams."

The image shows a metal container with four visible components: grilled chicken, green beans, pasta with tomato sauce, and grated parmesan. The target food item is 'pâtes' (pasta). Step 1, visual identification: the pasta is spiral-shaped (fusilli) and occupies about half of the container's right side, partially covered with a substantial layer of grated parmesan. Step 2, dimension analysis: the container appears to be a typical meal prep size, roughly 20cm by 13cm. The pasta portion covers an area approximately 8cm by 10cm, with a depth around 2.5-3cm estimated by the pile's height and the container's sides. Step 3, density considerations: cooked pasta is dense and compact, absorbing sauce, increasing weight compared to raw volume. Step 4, portion size calibration: based on the volume and density, the pasta likely weighs between 150g and 220g. The portion appears medium in size, so I estimate towards the mid to upper middle of this range. The parmesan contributes little to the pasta's weight and is excluded. Step 5, cross-validation: no obvious underestimation errors, the pasta shape and volume correspond well with the estimated weight. Therefore, the estimated weight for the pasta is 190 grams."

The image shows a rectangular glass container with three distinct food items: cooked épautre (spelt grain), scrambled eggs, and oven-baked eggplant. The target food item is 'épautre cuit'. First, locating the épautre, it occupies about one-third of the container's volume and appears as individual grains that are cooked but not overly compacted. Comparing it to the scrambled eggs and eggplant, the grains have some visible volume and thickness, likely around 3-4 cm deep. The container itself is medium-sized, likely about 15 cm by 15 cm, so the portion of épautre is approximately a 7 cm by 7 cm area with 3.5 cm depth. Cooked spelt has a density similar to cooked grains like barley or farro, around 1.3 g/cm³, which is denser than cooked rice due to its outer bran. Estimating the volume as 7×7×3.5 = 171.5 cm³, multiplying by density gives approximately 222 grams. Considering a Swiss portion context that usually serves slightly smaller portions and possible minor air gaps between grains, a conservative estimate would reduce this to about 200 grams. Therefore, the weight of the cooked épautre in this dish is approximately 200 grams."

The image shows one whole banana lying on a textured cushion, which provides size reference. The banana is medium-sized, typical for Swiss portion context, approximately 15-17 cm in length. Bananas generally have a density close to water, with typical medium bananas weighing between 100 and 130 grams without peel. Given the banana looks fully intact and of average girth without overripe softness or shrinkage, estimating at the middle to lower end of typical medium banana weights in Switzerland is reasonable. Therefore, the estimated weight of this banana is approximately 120 grams."

The image shows a single slice of gâteau au fromage blanc placed on a white plate with accompanying framboises and their juice. For the gâteau au fromage blanc, the slice is a typical small portion, roughly triangular with a base of about 6-7 cm, height of about 4 cm, and thickness around 2-3 cm. The texture is dense but airy due to the fromage blanc, and the crust adds some weight but is thin. Comparing to the hand holding the plate for scale, the slice is modest in size, consistent with Swiss dessert portions which tend to be smaller than US sizes. Estimating volume carefully and considering the density of such a cake (~0.9 g/cm³), this slice likely weighs between 90 to 110 grams. Taking the middle value for a medium portion, the estimated weight is about 100 grams."
wrah5h,gaufre,43.0,80,37.0,0.18823946994794133,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/0547baf7-3bf0-459d-b26f-4eb4c74bda8c,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows one full square waffle ('gaufre') on a medium-sized patterned plate, with some chocolate spread ('pâte à tartiner au chocolat') applied unevenly on top. Starting with the waffle, its visible size is about 12 cm by 12 cm based on comparing it to a typical dessert plate (about 22-24 cm diameter). The waffle appears to be of medium thickness, approximately 1.5 to 2 cm thick, with a light, aerated texture typical for Swiss portions, which tend to be smaller and lighter than US counterparts. Based on this and considering a typical waffle density and moisture content, a 12 cm square waffle with 1.5-2 cm thickness would weigh between 70 and 90 grams. Given the visible depth and light texture, I select a middle value around 80 grams. The chocolate spread is thinly but irregularly applied, so its weight is relatively small, and since only the waffle is to be estimated, I disregard it. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'gaufre' alone is 80 grams."

The image shows a metal container holding two pieces of pita-like bread or galette, one partially eaten and the other whole. Step 1: Visual identification - The target food 'pain/galette' corresponds to these two flatbreads visible in the container. Step 2: Dimension analysis - Each galette measures roughly 15-20 cm in length and about 10 cm width. They are flat but have some slight thickness around 3-4 mm. Considering standard Swiss portion sizes, such galettes are often smaller than typical US wraps. Step 3: Density considerations - Flatbreads like galettes are fairly dense but not heavy due to their thinness. Step 4: Portion size calibration - A single galette of this size and type typically weighs around 60-80 grams. The two combined (one partially eaten but appearing nearly whole size, and one whole) probably weigh around 120-130 grams in total. Since the visible pieces likely represent two full galettes with very little missing, I estimate the total 'pain/galette' weight as approximately 125 grams. Step 5: Cross-validation - The container size and visible bread dimensions confirm this range as reasonable and compatible with Swiss portion norms, avoiding overestimation."

The target food item is 'orange', represented here by peeled orange segments resting on a small plate alongside apple and kiwi slices. Step 1: Visual Identification: There are four visible orange segments, all peeled and without seeds or pith dominating their mass. Step 2: Dimension Analysis: Each orange segment is medium-sized, about 4-5 cm long, with a modest thickness. Comparing to the plate (~20cm diameter) and the other fruits helps gauge size. Step 3: Density Considerations: Orange segments have a high water content and moderate density, roughly 0.9 g/cm³. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration: Typical weight of a medium orange is around 130-150g whole; here only four segments are present, likely about half or slightly more of a medium orange. Step 5: Cross-validation: Accounting for the segments being peeled and no membranes adding significant bulk, the total weight is estimated conservatively. I estimate the total weight of the orange segments on the plate to be approximately 100 grams."

Each fish stick is rectangular, about 8-9 cm long, 3-4 cm wide, and roughly 1.5 cm thick. Breaded fish sticks are relatively dense but not overly heavy. A typical Swiss portion fish stick of this size weighs around 50-60 grams. With three pieces visible, the total weight approximates 150-180 grams. Considering the visual size, thickness, and typical density of breaded fish sticks common in Switzerland, I estimate the total weight of poissons panés to be around 165 grams."

The image shows two churros on a dark surface. Step 1: Visual Identification - There are two churros, one longer and one shorter. Both appear to be fully visible and not broken. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - By comparing to the subtle texture and typical size of a churro, each appears to be around 15-20 cm long for the longer one and about 12-15 cm for the shorter one. Both churros have a typical diameter of around 2-2.5 cm. Step 3: Density Considerations - Churros are fried doughs with a light but dense texture, roughly similar in density to fried batter-based snacks, estimated around 0.3-0.4 g/cm3. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - The typical weight of a churro of about 18 cm length and 2 cm diameter ranges around 40-50 grams. The smaller churro is estimated at around 27-33 grams. Summing the two, gives a total weight estimate between 67 and 83 grams, taking a medium portion size near the middle gives approximately 75 grams total weight."

The image shows a black bowl containing 'salade verte' (green salad) consisting of leafy greens with some darker purple leaves mixed in. The salad fills about half to two-thirds of a medium bowl. There are no additional bulky ingredients, just leaves without any dressing visible that would add significant weight. The leaves appear fresh and not overly packed, with average leaf size for mixed lettuce. Using the plate with a wrap beside it as a size reference, the bowl is about 15-18 cm in diameter, and the salad pile is about 3-4 cm thick, considering the loose, airy nature of lettuce which is less dense. Typical density of leafy greens is about 0.1 to 0.15 grams per cm3. Volume roughly estimates around 450-600 cm3, so applying density results in an estimated weight range of about 45-90 grams. Considering the portion size looks like a medium portion (not tiny but also not heaping), I place the weight towards the middle of this range. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'salade verte' is approximately 70 grams."

The target food item is 'tomate' (tomato). Step 1: Visual Identification - The tomatoes appear as roughly 8–10 medium-sized chopped pieces visible at the bottom and middle area of the bowl. These pieces are irregular in shape and size but are consistent with diced tomato chunks. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The bowl is a small to medium-sized white bowl, which provides scale. Each tomato piece is about 2–3 cm in length and width, with a depth corresponding to the dicing. Considering the volume, the total tomato portion is about the equivalent of half to two-thirds of a medium tomato. Step 3: Density Considerations - Tomatoes are mostly water and have a density close to water (approx. 0.95 g/cm3), so volume roughly converts to weight. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - A medium tomato weighs about 100–120 grams. Since the visible diced tomato volume corresponds to approximately half to two-thirds of a tomato, the weight estimate is around 50–75 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The tomatoes cover a significant portion of the bowl but do not dominate it; other ingredients (lettuce, radish, onion, apple) fill the rest of the volume. Therefore, estimating conservatively and accounting for some hidden pieces, I estimate the total weight of the tomatoes to be approximately 65 grams."

The sauce oignons is visible as a reddish-brown onion sauce poured over the slices of roast meat and partially spilling on the plate. The visible sauce portion covers the meat slice area but does not form a deep pool, indicating a thin layer of sauce. Considering the spread and typical density of onion sauce, which is somewhat thick but with liquid components, the volume on the plate corresponds visually to about 50-70 grams. Given the Swiss portion context, the sauce portion is moderate rather than excessive. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the sauce oignons to be approximately 60 grams."

Considering some pieces are smaller and cut, I estimate an average of approximately 10 grams per visible piece. Multiplying by 15 pieces gives an estimated total weight of around 150 grams. Accounting for depth and density, and the fact that strawberries are light but dense enough to not drastically vary in weight, the estimated total weight of the fraises is approximately 150 grams."

The image shows a bowl with clearly separated food items, including diced tomatoes, chopped cucumber, shredded carrots, pumpkin seeds on top, and a white cheese-like item (sérac). The target food is 'carotte', which is the shredded carrots visible in a significant portion of the bowl. Step 1: The shredded carrots are finely grated and piled visibly, roughly covering about 1/4 of the bowl's surface area. Step 2: Reference objects—the spoon and fork—indicate the bowl's diameter is medium sized, about 15-18 cm. The carrots have depth from the pile, estimating about 1.5 to 2 cm thick. Step 3: Carrots are dense vegetables that retain weight even when shredded. Shredded carrots have a density of about 0.6 to 0.7 g/cm³. Step 4: Estimating the volume: assuming the pile of carrots is roughly 10 cm by 6 cm by 1.8 cm (length × width × depth), volume is approximately 108 cm³. Multiplying by density ~0.65 yields approximately 70 grams. Step 5: Calibration for Swiss portion sizes and visible density supports a medium portion size around 65-75 grams. Step 6: Cross-validation with typical serving sizes for shredded carrots confirms this estimate as reasonable. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'carotte' portion is about 70 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread with butter and a translucent yellow quince jam (confiture de coing) spread on top. The target food is the quince jam. Step 1: Visual Identification - The quince jam is spread over both slices of bread in a thin to medium layer, with some small pools visible. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each slice is about standard Swiss bread slice size, roughly 10cm by 6cm; the jam layer appears thin with occasional thicker spots. The total jam coverage is about 20 square centimeters. Assuming an average jam spread thickness of about 3-4 millimeters, accounting for some pooling and uneven spread, volume is roughly 60-80 cubic centimeters (cm^3). Step 3: Density Considerations - Jam (sugar and fruit) typically has a density close to 1.2 grams per cm^3 due to sugar concentration. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Multiplying volume (about 70 cm^3 average) by density (1.2 g/cm^3) gives approximately 84 grams total jam present. Considering Swiss smaller portions and possible underestimation of spread thickness, a slightly conservative estimate is around 80 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The jam does not excessively pool or cluster, so overestimation is avoided. Given the size of bread and amount of jam spread, 80 grams is consistent and reasonable."

The image shows a white plate with three main food items: cooked basmati rice, pieces of cooked chicken with sauce, and gratin de côté de bêtes with béchamel. The target food item to estimate is 'riz basmati'. The rice portion occupies roughly one-third of the plate's visible surface and is loosely piled. Comparing the grain size and volume to the plate diameter (~25 cm standard), the rice pile measures approximately 10 cm by 7 cm in area, with an estimated depth of about 2.5 cm, since cooked rice is dense and compact in texture. This gives a volume estimate of roughly 175 cubic centimeters. Cooked basmati rice density is around 0.85 g/cm³ due to moisture content. Multiplying volume by density results in approximately 149 grams. Given typical Swiss serving sizes tend to be moderate, and considering possible air gaps in the rice mound, estimating slightly lower for conservative accuracy is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the riz basmati on the plate to be about 140 grams."

Comparing to the plate diameter (approximately 20 cm) and the adjacent rice and ratatouille portions, the soufflé's volume appears moderate but thick, with an estimated depth of around 2-3 cm. The soufflé is a light, airy preparation which makes it less dense than other foods like rice. A typical medium portion of cheese soufflé in a Swiss context would weigh between 110 and 150 grams. Considering the moderate size and the visible texture and thickness, I estimate the soufflé au fromage portion here to be about 130 grams."
xjvrtk,galettes millet haricots noirs maïs,200.0,225,25.0,0.5915759583530525,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/32289b41-a85a-4563-8e38-c47e7693d2d0,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a bowl with four main visible food items: green salad leaves with balsamic vinegar, cooked mushrooms, galettes made with millet, black beans, and corn, and a portion of beetroot lentil purée. Focusing on the galettes millet haricots noirs maïs, there appear to be three moderately sized patties placed together, with visible grains and beans. Each galette is about the size of a medium palm, approximately 7-8 cm in diameter and about 1.5-2 cm thick. Considering their dense composition (millet, beans, and corn), they are heavier than they appear. Comparing their volume to the other bowl contents and standard Swiss portion sizes for similar patties, a single galette likely weighs around 70-80 grams. With three galettes present, a total of about 210-240 grams is a reasonable range. Considering the middle portion for a meal, I estimate the total weight of the galettes millet haricots noirs maïs to be approximately 225 grams."

The brochette de poulet is visually identified as a single chicken skewer on the plate. It appears to have about 3-4 small pieces of chicken on a wooden stick. Using the plate size and the potato chips as reference, the chicken pieces are relatively small and grilled. Typically, a small piece of cooked chicken meat weighs about 20-25 grams. Given there are about 3 pieces, total weight would be around 60-75 grams. The density of cooked chicken is quite high, so the estimate leans towards the higher side of that range. Considering this portion is from Swiss context and looks like a smaller serving, I estimate the weight of the brochettes de poulet to be approximately 70 grams."

The image shows a clear container with four food items. The target food is 'fromage pate molle,' which is the soft cheese at the bottom right of the container. Step 1: VISUAL IDENTIFICATION - The soft cheese is cut into two pieces. Step 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS - Comparing it to the size of the millet and black bean galettes next to it and the container size, each piece is roughly the size of a small golf ball, about 3-4 cm in diameter. The depth or thickness appears to be similar, giving a roughly spherical shape. Step 3: DENSITY CONSIDERATIONS - Soft cheeses are relatively dense but not as much as hard cheese. Typical soft cheese density is about 1.05 g/cm³. The pieces have some air pockets but overall firm texture. Step 4: PORTION SIZE CALIBRATION - A small portion of soft cheese piece of this size commonly weighs around 30-40 grams each. There are two pieces, so total weight is about 60-80 grams. Step 5: CROSS-VALIDATION - Given Swiss portion sizes tend smaller, and the visual estimate, I would place the total weight nearer to 65 grams. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'fromage pate molle' in the image to be approximately 65 grams."

The image shows one peeled carrot ('carotte pelée') placed on a granite countertop. The carrot appears to be roughly 15-18 cm in length and has a typical medium thickness of about 3-4 cm diameter. Peeled carrots weigh less than unpeeled due to the removal of the skin, but the difference is minor. A medium peeled carrot generally weighs between 100 to 130 grams. Given the carrot's size and density, and considering Swiss portion context which tends to be moderate-sized, I estimate the weight of this peeled carrot to be approximately 115 grams."

The target food item is 'tomate,' which is visibly sliced and arranged in a stack on the right side of the container. There are seven tomato slices, each approximately 0.5 cm thick, with an estimated diameter of about 7-8 cm. Compared to the glass container, these slices occupy a modest volume. Tomatoes are dense and contain water, but their weight will be moderate due to air gaps between slices. Considering typical tomato slice weights of about 15-20 grams per slice in Swiss portion size, and accounting for slight shrinkage and moisture loss, the total weight of this sliced tomato portion is estimated to be around 110 grams."

The image shows a piece of bread ('pain') spread with eggplant caviar ('caviar d'aubergines'). The target food to estimate is 'caviar d'aubergines'. In step 1, I identified the 'caviar d'aubergines' as the topping spread over the bread slice, covering an area of approximately 10 cm by 5 cm, with an estimated average depth of about 1 cm. The spread appears thick and chunky but not densely packed, which is typical for eggplant caviar. In step 2, comparing the bread size (a piece of typical artisanal bread around 12-15 cm long) gives a realistic size reference. The thickness of the spread is moderate, suggesting a volume of roughly 50 cubic centimeters. In step 3, considering the density of eggplant caviar (mostly pureed cooked vegetables, somewhat watery but thickened), the density is approximately 0.8 grams per cubic centimeter. In step 4, the portion looks like a small to medium topping quantity, as it does not fully saturate the bread or appear heaped. Thus, estimating between 40 to 60 grams. In step 5, cross-validating this portion size with common serving sizes of eggplant caviar (typically around 50g per serving), and considering the area and thickness, I estimate the weight of the caviar d'aubergines on the bread slice to be approximately 48 grams."

The image shows one single pear ('poire') being held in a hand. It appears to be a medium-sized pear, with a typical elongated shape and visible thickness. Using the hand as a reference, the pear is approximately the length of an adult's palm and fingers combined. The pear looks dense and ripe, with a typical moisture content for this fruit. Swiss portions for a medium pear generally range between 150-200 grams. Considering the visual volume, thickness, and density, and that the pear is whole and unpeeled, I estimate the weight of this single pear to be approximately 180 grams."

The image shows a small bowl containing white séré maigre (a type of low-fat quark) topped with chopped kiwi pieces. The séré maigre fills roughly half to two-thirds of the bowl's volume. Considering the typical serving size in Swiss portions, this bowl appears to contain a modest amount, likely around 100-130 grams. The texture is thick but smooth, consistent with séré maigre, and the bowl size compared to the spoon suggests a small to medium serving. I estimate the weight of the séré maigre to be approximately 120 grams, as it is a dense dairy product and its quantity is visually moderate."

The target food item is 'salade'. Visually, the salad is placed on the left side of the plate and consists of leafy greens with some sunflower seeds sprinkled on top. The salad portion occupies about one third of the plate's surface area. Comparing it to the plate size (standard medium-sized dinner plate, approximately 25 cm diameter) and the portion size, the leafy greens appear to be loosely packed and fresh, which means lower density. Given typical Swiss portion sizes, the salad portion here would be smaller than American sizes. Leafy salad weight density is about 10–15 g per handful of this volume, but this looks like approximately 1.5 handfuls loosely distributed. Taking depth and some seeds into account, the salad likely weighs between 40 and 60 grams. Considering the visible volume and loose packing, I estimate the total weight of the salade to be about 50 grams."

The quinoa is visibly occupying about half of the white bowl. The grains are cooked, which means they are denser and have absorbed water, increasing their weight compared to dry form. The quantity appears to be a moderate portion size for a Swiss meal, smaller than US portions but filling for one person. Comparing the quinoa size to the asparagus stalks and salmon piece, the quinoa depth and compactness is roughly 2-3 cm thick over a circular base about 12 cm in diameter. Cooked quinoa has a density around 0.8 g/cm3. Estimating volume visually and converting using density, I calculate a medium portion of cooked quinoa to be approximately 130 grams, considering typical Swiss portion sizes and the fact some grains are scattered around the bowl."

The target food item is 'avocat' (avocado). Step 1: Visual identification shows about 5 avocado slices near the top left-center of the container. These slices are moderately thick and intact. Step 2: Using the container as reference (standard lunchbox size approx. 20x10 cm), each slice measures roughly 4-5 cm in length, 1.5-2 cm width, and about 1.5 cm thickness. Step 3: Avocado is dense and creamy, with an average density around 0.96 g/cm³. Step 4: Estimating volume as the sum of the 5 slices (average size approx. 4.5 x 1.75 x 1.5 cm = about 11.8 cm³ per slice), total volume roughly 59 cm³. Multiplying by density, weight is approximately 57 grams. Step 5: Considering some margin for estimation error and slight depth difference, I set a range of 55 to 65 grams and select a middle estimate for a medium portion. Thus, I estimate the total weight of the avocado to be about 60 grams."

The image shows two medium-sized strawberries ('fraise') placed on a wooden surface. Each strawberry is whole, with the green calyx intact. They appear to have typical size and shape for fresh strawberries, roughly 3-4 cm in length. Visually, no signs of dehydration or damage that would affect weight. Considering Swiss portion context, where strawberries tend to be smaller than US varieties, and standard average weight of a medium strawberry is about 18-20 grams. Therefore, for two strawberries, the estimated total weight is approximately 36-40 grams. Choosing a conservative middle estimate for accuracy, I estimate the total weight of the two strawberries to be around 38 grams."

Visually, the tomato sauce is spread across the right half of the container, underneath and mixed with the tagliatelle pasta and some cheese. The sauce appears to be moderately thick with visible tomato chunks, covering an area approximately half of the container's base (about 12 cm by 9 cm approx). Estimating depth, the sauce is likely around 0.8 to 1 cm thick under and between the pasta layers, accounting for hidden volume. Tomato sauce has a medium density, slightly less dense than water but close (around 1 g per cm³). Multiplying area (approx 108 cm²) by depth (about 1 cm) gives a volume of about 108 cm³, or roughly 108 grams. Considering some pasta volume displaces sauce, and some mixing with cheese, a moderate range is 90-110 grams. Given this portion size is Swiss context (smaller portions), I estimate the tomato sauce weight at approximately 100 grams."

The fromage (etivaz) is the long rectangular cheese piece located on the left side of the plate next to the slice of baguette. Visually, it measures approximately 8-9 cm in length, about 2 cm in width, and seems to have a thickness of roughly 1.5-2 cm. The cheese has a dense texture typical of Etivaz, a firm Alpine cheese, which indicates a relatively high density. Comparing it to the baguette slice and the knife nearby for scale, the volume suggests a small-to-medium portion. Firm cheeses usually weigh around 1 gram per cubic centimeter. Estimating the volume as roughly 8 cm x 2 cm x 1.7 cm = 27.2 cm³, the weight should be close to 27 grams. Considering slight irregularities and possible air pockets, a conservative estimate around 25-28 grams is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the fromage (etivaz) piece to be approximately 27 grams."

The image shows two pieces of pain au céréales that are topped with pâte à tartiner au chocolat. The target food is the chocolate spread. Step 1: VISUAL IDENTIFICATION - The chocolate spread is visible as a thin layer covering the top surface of both bread slices. There are two separate pieces, each approximately 17-18 cm long, about 5-6 cm wide at the thick end and tapering. Step 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS - The spread appears quite thin, likely around 2-3 mm in thickness on average. Since it is spread on two slices, the total surface area covered is around 20-22 cm by 5-6 cm per slice, roughly 100-120 cm² total. Step 3: DENSITY CONSIDERATIONS - Chocolate spread has a semi-dense, creamy texture, with an estimated density of approximately 1.2 g/cm³. Considering the thin spread, the volume is small but relatively dense. Step 4: PORTION SIZE CALIBRATION - Calculating the volume (surface area × thickness): approximated 110 cm² × 0.25 cm = 27.5 cm³. Multiplying by density: 27.5 × 1.2 = approximately 33 grams. Step 5: CROSS-VALIDATION - The portion is moderate; chocolate spread portions on bread slices are typically around 15-20 grams per slice, so 30-35 grams total for two slices aligns well. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the pâte à tartiner au chocolat to be about 33 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification: The egg is a single fried egg, fully visible on the plate. No pieces are missing or hidden. Step 2: Dimension Analysis: The egg occupies a moderate area on a standard-sized dinner plate, roughly about 10 cm in length and 7 cm in width. The egg white is thin and spread, with a typical fried egg thickness of about 3-5 mm covering the base. The yolk is well-centered and appears slightly raised. Step 3: Density Considerations: Eggs are relatively dense and compact, especially fried eggs where most of the liquid has coagulated. A standard large fried egg weighs approximately 45-50 grams. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration: Considering Swiss portion sizes, this egg appears to be a standard large egg commonly used for a single serving, not a smaller or extra-large one. Step 5: Cross-Validation: No visible anomalies or alterations in the egg size. Compared to the surrounding items (potatoes, zucchini slices), the size and volume of the egg correspond to an average large egg cooked as fried. Therefore, the most accurate estimation based on the visual evidence is approximately 48 grams for the 'œuf'."

The image shows a single piece of dark chocolate brownie with visible chopped walnuts inside, placed on a piece of green tissue paper. The brownie piece measures approximately 5 cm by 5 cm in surface area, and appears about 2.5 cm thick based on visual depth cues and typical brownie densities. Brownies are dense and compact, with the addition of walnuts increasing the overall weight slightly. For a Swiss portion, which tends to be moderate-sized, this piece looks like a medium portion brownie square. Based on typical brownie densities around 1.1 g/cm3, the estimated volume is approximately 5 x 5 x 2.5 = 62.5 cm3, giving an estimated weight in the range of 60-70 grams. Considering walnuts embedded inside, I select a weight close to the middle of the range at about 65 grams."

The image shows two slices of toast on a plate. The target food item is 'toast', so we focus only on these toasted bread slices. Each slice is approximately square, about the size of typical pre-sliced bread in Switzerland, roughly 10 cm by 10 cm, with about 1.5 cm thickness. Toasted bread has a density slightly less than fresh bread due to loss of moisture but the weight difference is minimal for portion estimation. A standard slice of pre-sliced bread weighs about 30-35 grams before toasting. Given that the two slices appear typical in size, average thickness, and the surface texture is toasted but not significantly shrunk, I estimate each slice weighs about 32 grams. Since there are two slices on the plate, the total weight of 'toast' is approximately 64 grams."

The target food item is 'oeuf au plat' (fried egg). In the image, the oeuf au plat is located on the right side of the plate. It is fully visible and appears to be a single medium-sized fried egg with the typical size of about one large egg cooked flat. Comparing its size to the nearby bread rolls and cherry tomatoes which are common reference sizes, the egg covers a reasonable surface area. The egg white is spread thinly around the yolk but has some volume. Typical large eggs weigh about 50 grams in shell, with the edible part (white and yolk) roughly 43-45 grams. Cooking causes slight water loss but does not remove mass. Considering the egg is fully cooked and visually intact, I estimate the cooked oeuf au plat weighs approximately 45 grams, accounting only for the edible part without shell."

The image shows a bowl containing three components: pasta, gratinated zucchini slices, and a creamy mushroom sauce. The target food item is the ""sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon)"" which appears as creamy white sauce-covered mushroom pieces distributed mainly atop and mixed with the pasta. Step 1: Identification - The mushroom sauce consists of visible whole or halved mushroom pieces coated in a creamy sauce. I count approximately 8-10 mushroom pieces in the bowl clearly identifiable as part of the sauce. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The bowl size relative to the white plate suggests a medium single-serving bowl. The mushrooms are thick sliced button mushrooms, approximately 3-4 cm in length each. The creamy sauce volume is adhering closely to the mushrooms and pasta, so the total volume is small but dense. Step 3: Density Consideration - Mushrooms have water content but are somewhat dense. The creamy sauce adds some weight but is mostly liquid. Combined under sauce, mushrooms plus creamy sauce density would be slightly heavier than mushrooms alone but less than pure cream. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Given roughly 8-10 mushroom pieces, each averaging about 8 grams raw, and adding some weight for cream sauce portion (estimated around 20 grams), the total weight of mushroom sauce including cream is estimated. Step 5: Cross-Validation - Not ignoring hidden sauce beneath pasta, and considering Swiss portion sizes which are modest. Overall, a medium portion of this sauce with mushrooms and cream in this serving would be approximately 90 grams in total."

The sauce à salade (salad dressing) appears to be lightly mixed throughout the rice salad on the plate, but no visible extra pool or container of salad dressing is seen. The dressing is likely a vinaigrette or light sauce dressing, which is typically added sparingly. Given the overall portion size and visible moisture, the estimated volume of the sauce is small, as it lightly coats the other ingredients. Comparing it to the amount of rice (a medium portion) and vegetables, the likely weight of the sauce à salade would be in a small range of 15-25 grams. Taking a conservative estimate suited to Swiss portion sizes and visual moisture coverage, I assess the sauce à salade weighs approximately 20 grams."

The target food item is 'perle de blé' which is visible as small, round grain pearls mixed with a saffron cream sauce and shrimp. Visually, the pearls occupy about one third of the bowl's volume, partially hidden under and around the shrimp and sauce. The bowl appears medium-sized, with a diameter of roughly 15 cm. The perle de blé layer is somewhat compacted but not densely packed. Considering the pearls' approximate depth is about 2-3 cm and taking into account their density, which is moderate and slightly dense when cooked, as well as a generous amount of sauce mixed in, the total weight of the perle de blé portion is estimated. Given Swiss portion context where portions tend to be more moderate, I estimate the perle de blé weight to be around 130 grams as a medium portion, balancing the visible amount with typical cooked grain densities."

The image shows two whole peeled boiled eggs ('oeufs') on a plate. Both eggs appear to be medium-sized, as measured against the size of the cucumber slices and lettuce nearby. A typical medium-sized boiled egg weighs about 50 grams after peeling (shell excluded). Since there are exactly two eggs visible, the total weight is approximately 2 x 50 = 100 grams. There is no visible damage or missing parts that would reduce weight, so the estimate is straightforward and reliable as 100 grams."

The image shows four slices of apple ('pomme') in a small white container. The slices include both skin and flesh, with a visible red skin typical of a medium-sized apple variety. Step 1: There are four pieces visible, partially overlapping, with none hidden. Step 2: Comparing to the container size and estimated dimensions, each slice appears to be about one quarter of a medium apple. Step 3: Apples are mostly water, with moderate density; a medium apple typically weighs around 150 grams total. Step 4: Since the slices represent nearly one whole medium apple but with some core and seeds removed, the total weight should be just under 150 grams, accounting for slight reduction due to core removal. Step 5: Cross-validating, the portion looks like a medium-sized apple's worth of slices. Therefore, estimated weight is approximately 130 grams."

The target food item is 'yaourt nature', which is the natural yogurt shown in the image. STEP 1: Visual Identification - The yogurt is in a standard single-serving container, opened and mostly filled. The container is a typical Swiss-size yogurt pot. STEP 2: Dimension Analysis - The container is roughly 5-6 cm wide and 6-7 cm tall. The yogurt fills almost to the top, so depth is nearly the full container height. STEP 3: Density Considerations - Natural yogurt density is close to that of water, around 1 g/ml, so volume in milliliters will correspond closely to grams. STEP 4: Portion Size Calibration - Standard single-serving yogurt pots in Switzerland usually contain between 100 to 125 grams. Visually, this pot aligns with that typical size. STEP 5: Cross-Validation - Given the size of the container compared to the adjacent apple, which is a small to medium apple, the yogurt container size and fill level confirm this estimate. Therefore, the yogurt weighs approximately 125 grams."

The image shows a bowl containing milk and cereals ('céréales'). The cereals appear to be flakes of mixed grains with some granola-like chunks distributed throughout the milk. The bowl is a small to medium-sized cereal bowl, and the cereal layer is partially submerged in milk, spreading over the bottom but not heaped. Visually, the cereal layer covers about 60-70% of the bottom surface area of the bowl, with a shallow depth of approximately 1.5 to 2 centimeters, considering the thickness of flakes and small granola pieces. Based on typical Swiss portion sizes for a morning cereal serving and the apparent density of the flakes and granola pieces, the total weight of dry cereal portion before adding milk is likely in the range of 30 to 45 grams. Given the visible volume and density with milk soaking it, a conservative and accurate estimate of the cereal alone is approximately 38 grams."

The image shows a plate with two distinct food items: a serving of cooked spaghetti with parmesan cheese sprinkled on top, and a portion of ratatouille on the side. The target food item to estimate is ""parmesan."" Visually, the parmesan is finely grated and spread over part of the pasta. The area covered by parmesan is approximately half the surface of the pasta portion, with a moderate thickness typical for sprinkling. Compared to the size of the plate and pasta (Swiss portion context, smaller than US), the amount of parmesan looks to be around a tablespoon or slightly more. Given that one tablespoon of grated parmesan typically weighs about 5-6 grams, and this amount appears to be close to that range but not heaping, a reasonable estimate would be around 5 grams. There are no large chunks or blocks of parmesan visible, only grated cheese spread thinly, so no additional weight adjustments are necessary."

The target food item to estimate is 'pain' (bread). The bread portion visible on the plate appears as a single short piece, roughly the size of a thumb in length and about 4 cm wide, visibly a segment of a baguette or similar small crusty bread. Considering standard densities and typical Swiss portion sizes, a piece of such bread typically weighs around 30-40 grams for this size. The bread is not thickly sliced but is a chunk broken from a larger piece, so I estimate its weight closer to the lower end of that scale due to apparent thickness and portion size. Therefore, the estimated weight of the bread piece is approximately 35 grams."

The spread covers the bread slice with a visible thickness suggesting a moderate amount. Comparing to the bread slice, the spread layer is uneven but roughly about 0.5 cm thick on average and covers approximately 70-80% of the bread surface. Considering the typical density of chestnut cream (which is thick and somewhat dense, similar to honey), and the visible area, this looks like around 15-20 grams of chestnut cream. Accounting for some variation and possible slight spreading loss, I estimate the weight of the 'crème de marrons' to be approximately 18 grams."

Comparing its size to the cherry tomatoes and the boiled egg half, the asparagus spear appears to be a typical slender spear, about 1-1.5 cm thick. Asparagus has a moderate density, fairly firm but light overall. A standard medium asparagus spear weighs approximately 15-20 grams. Given the visual cues and typical Swiss portion size—often smaller than US portions—and considering only the single visible spear, I estimate the weight of the asparagus on the plate to be around 18 grams."

The image shows two small chocolate figures shaped like rabbits. I am to estimate the weight of one 'chocolat'. Each piece appears solid and about the size of a small chocolate bunny typically found in Swiss seasonal confections. Compared to the texture of the table surface and the placemat in the background for scale, each chocolate rabbit is approximately 4-5 cm in height and about 2.5-3 cm wide, with an estimated thickness of about 1.5-2 cm. Milk chocolate density is roughly 1.3 g/cm³. Using estimated dimensions of about 4.5 cm x 3 cm x 2 cm, the volume is around 27 cm³. Multiplying by density gives approximately 35 grams. Given some hollow shaping typical in molded chocolate rabbits, the actual weight would be less than the solid volume estimate. Hence, an estimated weight of a single chocolate rabbit is around 20-25 grams. Considering it looks fairly solid but not massive, I estimate the weight of one chocolat (one rabbit) to be 22 grams."

The focus is on one ""feuilleté sauce tomate"" piece visible on a wooden surface. This is a small puff pastry roll with tomato sauce visible on one side. Step 1: Visual Identification – There is only one feuilleté visible; it is a small individual piece, not part of a larger plate. Step 2: Dimension Analysis – By comparing to the wood grain and typical table surface, this puff pastry is estimated around 4-5 cm length, 3-4 cm width, and about 2-3 cm height. Step 3: Density Considerations – Puff pastry is relatively light but with layers, and moist tomato sauce adds small extra weight. Considering density, a piece this size would weigh less than solid bread but more than a thin crisp. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration – Given Swiss portion norms which are smaller than US, and the clear single small piece, the weight is likely on the lower end to mid range for such baked snacks. Step 5: Cross-Validation – The piece is clearly baked (crispy edges shown), some sauce overflow is visible but minimal volume. Estimated weight range is roughly 20 to 30 grams. Choosing the middle, considering the thickness and sauce content, a good, reasonable estimate is 25 grams."

Considering an average cashew nut weighs about 1.3 grams each, and these nuts look like typical medium-sized ones with no visible abnormalities. The nuts fill the palm area but are not overly packed or heaped, suggesting no hidden volume beyond what is visible. Cashews are dense nuts, so their weight corresponds closely to their size. Multiplying the count by the average weight (13 x 1.3g) results in approximately 16.9 grams. Given the hand's size and typical Swiss portion sizes, this is a moderately small portion size, so I estimate the total weight of the cashew nuts to be around 17 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread with chocolate spread ('pâte à tartiner au chocolat') on top of them on a plate. The target food item to estimate is 'pain' (bread). Step 1: Visual identification - both visible slices appear to be part of a baguette or similar crusty bread. Step 2: Dimension analysis - each slice is roughly the size of a standard finger bread slice, around 12-15 cm long and 4-5 cm wide at the widest point. The slices are thick, about 2-3 cm in depth, including crust and crumb. Step 3: Density consideration - bread is a porous, lightweight food, so despite the size, its density is relatively low compared to more compact foods. Step 4: Portion size calibration - two slices together likely represent a medium portion of Swiss-style bread. Step 5: Cross-validation - as the bread is quite aerated and textured, the weight is less than it would appear based on volume alone. Given standard estimates for sliced baguette pieces of this size, approximately 35-40 grams per slice is reasonable, with two slices totaling around 75 grams. This estimate excludes the chocolate spread weight as specified. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the bread ('pain') on the plate to be about 75 grams."

The amount appears to be roughly a tablespoon's worth scattered across the salad area. Considering sunflower seeds have a relatively high density and weight per volume, and that a tablespoon of sunflower seeds is approximately 9-10 grams, but given the scattered distribution and probable partial mixing into the salad implying a little less than a full tablespoon, I estimate the total weight of the sunflower seeds on the plate to be about 6 grams."

The target food item is 'graines de chia' (chia seeds). Visually, the chia seeds are well dispersed and mixed within the white creamy mixture in the bowl, appearing as small black specks throughout. Given the tiny size of each seed, they are hard to count individually and the seeds are not in a separate pile but mixed in a semi-liquid matrix. The bowl appears medium-sized, standard for a breakfast serving, and the chia seeds likely form a thin layer or dispersed small quantity within the mixture. Chia seeds are dense and small, so a small volume corresponds to a significant weight. The estimated total chia seed volume looks roughly equivalent to about 10 grams, considering that typical chia seeds are about 1 gram per tablespoon by volume and there seems to be about 1 to 1.5 tablespoons' worth dispersed in the bowl. This is consistent with a usual portion of chia seeds used in recipes. Therefore, the estimated weight of 'graines de chia' in this bowl is approximately 10 grams."

The scoop of ice cream on top is compact and dense due to the nuts mixed in, with visible small pieces indicating texture and density. The ice cream portion appears to be approximately one modest scoop, roughly spherical with a diameter around 6-7 cm. Given the density of nut-flavored ice cream and the cone's size, the cone likely weighs about 15 grams (common for small cones), and the ice cream scoop about 80 grams. Since we exclude the cone weight, only the ice cream weight counts. Therefore, the weight of the hazelnut ice cream alone is estimated at about 80 grams, which aligns with typical small Swiss single scoop sizes and the visible volume in the image."

It has visible chocolate chunks embedded, which are dense and add to the total weight. Considering the thickness, which appears to be around 1.5 cm, and the fact that cookies are dense baked goods with a combination of flour, butter, sugar, and chocolate chunks, the density is relatively high. Comparing to typical Swiss portion sizes which are slightly smaller than US versions, this cookie seems medium to large but not oversized.

The size can be roughly compared to typical chocolate bar segments, which are usually about 10-12 grams each for dense dark chocolate. Both pieces together form a small portion. Considering the thickness, density of dark chocolate, and typical Swiss portion sizes which tend to be moderate, I estimate the total weight of these two pieces of 'chocolat noir crémant' to be approximately 22 grams."
p8a2w5,"dalh de lentilles corail (lentilles corail, oignon, carottes, tomates concassées, 1cs huilde d'olive, épices)",271.0,270,1.0,0.03206341694273545,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/82b53493-1c97-472b-9ec6-8cc698b8cfe4,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a bowl with two distinct portions: white rice on the left and dalh de lentilles corail on the right. The dalh portion appears thick and dense, containing visible carrot slices, lentils, and a tomato-based sauce. Step 1: The target food, dalh de lentilles corail, occupies roughly half of a medium-sized bowl. The lentils and vegetables are well mixed but the portion is visibly distinct from the rice. Step 2: Using the bowl size and the spoon as reference, the dalh portion depth is significant, likely about 4-5cm deep, which contributes to the volume. The spread and compact nature suggests substantial weight. Step 3: Considering the density of cooked coral lentils mixed with vegetables and sauce, the density of this food is relatively high, so visual volume is a good proxy for weight. Step 4: Standard portions of dalh in Swiss contexts tend to be moderate; this looks like a medium to large portion. The volume and density suggest a weight range of approximately 200-300 grams. Step 5: Cross-validating common portion sizes and avoiding underestimation typical with legume dishes, a middle estimate of 270 grams fits well. Therefore, the estimated weight of the dalh de lentilles corail is 270 grams."
ppf8hc,tartelettes aux chocolats,57.0,58,1.0,0.006743965925224799,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/8e2ab1f4-8271-4112-8c2f-f399d360b591,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'tartelettes aux chocolats', which is the left tart on the plate. It is a small chocolate tartlet, approximately half of a small tart, based on shape and size relative to the plate. The plate is a standard small dessert plate about 20-22 cm wide. The tartlet width is roughly 6-7 cm and length is about 3-4 cm (half of a 6-7 cm diameter tart). The chocolate tartlet has a thick chocolate topping and a dense shortcrust base, giving it moderate density. Considering the volume and density of chocolate and pastry, and Swiss portion sizes which are modest, a whole chocolate tartlet of this size would weigh around 100-120 grams when whole. Since this piece is half a tartlet, the estimated weight is around 50-60 grams. Given the relatively thick chocolate topping and base, the weight is closer to the upper middle of this range. Therefore, I estimate the 'tartelettes aux chocolats' half piece shown to weigh approximately 58 grams."
2ahgvr,moutarde,7.0,7,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a2d48966-aa71-4479-8b0f-d28dbf8ffab6,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'moutarde' (mustard), which is presumably inside the pita sandwich. Visually, the mustard itself is not directly visible on the plate or as a distinct portion — it is likely spread thinly inside the pita bread underneath the visible layers of lettuce and ham. Considering typical sandwich preparations in Swiss portion contexts, mustard is usually applied as a thin layer weighing between 5 to 10 grams. It is a dense condiment but used sparingly to avoid overpowering the sandwich. Given the size of the pita sandwich (about a half pita) and the presence of other ingredients, the mustard quantity is probably around the medium portion range close to 7 grams. Therefore, based on logical deduction and typical condiment usage, the estimated weight of the mustard is approximately 7 grams."
