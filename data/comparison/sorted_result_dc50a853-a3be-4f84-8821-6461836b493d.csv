The image shows several pieces of fresh pineapple ('ananas') cut into roughly triangular chunks on a medium-sized plate. Each chunk appears about 3-5 cm in length and about 1.5-2 cm thick on average. Pineapple is a juicy fruit with moderate density. There are approximately 12 pieces visible, which collectively form a moderate portion. Typical pineapple pieces of this size weigh around 30-40 grams each. Multiplying by 12 pieces gives a range of approximately 360 to 480 grams. Considering some pieces are smaller and some larger, and the depth of the chunks, a reasonable estimate is around 420 grams."
r3bub9,risotto aux asperges,305.0,100,205.0,2.7285620772419814,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/r3bub9/dish_media/207070c9-c6dd-4cf9-b0a7-5979b06babc3,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small portion of risotto with asparagus on a rectangular plate. The risotto appears to be spread in a small, compact cluster with visible rice grains and several identifiable pieces of asparagus. The portion size looks small, likely a side or a light serving. Considering the density of cooked risotto (which is moist but not overly heavy), and the visible amount, the portion likely weighs between 80 and 120 grams. Given its size relative to the plate and the thickness of the cluster, a medium estimate toward the lower-middle of this range seems appropriate. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this portion of risotto aux asperges to be approximately 100 grams."
xjvrtk,cidre,500.0,300,200.0,4.363953742090334,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/62c48fc7-a443-4018-9e30-62ecd36ead23,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a transparent glass filled almost to the brim with cidre, a common fermented apple beverage. The glass appears to be typical of a pub or casual dining setting, likely holding around 300 ml of liquid. Since the density of cidre is close to that of water, the weight in grams will be approximately equal to its volume in milliliters. Taking into account the fullness and size of the glass, the weight of the cidre in the glass is likely between 270 and 320 grams. Considering the medium to full volume presented visually, an accurate estimate would be around 300 grams."
xjvrtk,soupe à la tomate,400.0,220,180.0,3.1420466943050402,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/f87a2a81-9c85-454b-af47-38ed4c42554b,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a bowl filled with tomato soup that contains several large chunks of tomato and a thick liquid base. The bowl appears to be shallow and about 15 cm in diameter. The soup fills nearly the entire bowl to a shallow depth, estimated visually to be about 2-3 cm deep. Considering the density of tomato soup is close to water but slightly heavier due to pieces and seasoning, a portion of this visible size in a shallow bowl would weigh between 180-250 grams. Given the sizeable tomato chunks and the thickness of the soup, I estimate the total weight of the soupe à la tomate to be around 220 grams, which fits well within the plausible range for a medium portion in such a bowl."
xjvrtk,côtes de bettes à la sauce tomate,300.0,140,160.0,2.09469779620336,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/fb18c515-abdf-434a-a433-9969b1061d3c,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a bowl containing two distinct food items: 'côtes de bettes à la sauce tomate' (Swiss chard stems cooked in tomato sauce) submerged in a visible amount of sauce, and an 'omelette au persil' resting on the edge of the bowl. Concentrating on the 'côtes de bettes à la sauce tomate,' they appear as a cooked vegetable portion with leafy and stem pieces softened and reduced in size by cooking. The vegetables fill approximately half of a small to medium-sized bowl, and the tomato sauce adds some volume but has low density. Taking into account cooked vegetable shrinkage yet dense stems, the visible portion would reasonably weigh more than a light salad but less than a thick vegetable stew. Given the plate size and depth cues, an estimated plausible range for the Swiss chard dish is 120-160 grams. The portion does not look overly abundant but enough for a moderate serving of a side vegetable dish. I therefore select a midpoint estimate of 140 grams, consistent with the visual volume and the density of cooked Swiss chard with tomato sauce."
xjvrtk,courgette et oignons,300.0,140,160.0,2.09469779620336,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a glass container divided into two parts: on the left, there is a cooked mixture of courgette (zucchini) and onions, sliced and sautéed, with some visible seasoning. The volume of the courgette and onions portion fills about half of the container. The zucchini pieces are medium-sized slices, and the onions are thinly sliced, cooked down but still clearly visible. The container itself looks like a typical glass storage container about 15cm x 15cm square and about 4-5 cm deep. Based on this, the courgette and onion mixture appears to be a moderate portion, not overly packed but reasonably dense. Considering the water content and softness of cooked courgettes and onions, the weight is less than it would appear from volume alone due to some air trapped but still fairly dense when cooked and mixed. A similar portion of cooked vegetables of this visible size generally weighs about 120-160 grams. Given the portion size is medium and the container is about half full, I estimate the weight of the courgette and onion mixture to be about 140 grams as a reasonable midpoint. This accounts for depth and density without overestimation."
p96w4a,délice tomate mozzarella,54.0,195,141.0,0.33227143792275804,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/5ebafbd6-315d-44a6-8508-ba143d23adb2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with a 'délice tomate mozzarella', which consists of alternating slices of tomato and mozzarella, drizzled with balsamic vinegar and sprinkled with herbs. The portion appears to be a half-portion or a side dish rather than a full meal. There are about 6 tomato slices and 6 mozzarella slices, each slice being approximately 0.5 cm thick. A medium tomato slice weighs roughly 15-18 grams, and a mozzarella slice of similar size weighs about 15-20 grams due to its density. By counting and estimating, the combined weight of the tomato and mozzarella slices is calculated roughly as 6 slices × 16.5 grams (average tomato) + 6 slices × 17.5 grams (average mozzarella), totaling approximately 198 grams. Since the dish is called a 'délice', the portion may be slightly smaller or arranged compactly; the visible amount here is medium-sized. Allowing for slight overlap, moisture content, and the balsamic drizzle which adds negligible weight, the true weight range could be 180-210 grams. A reasonable precise estimate is about 195 grams."
2ahgvr,porridge salé,48.0,180,132.0,0.27650010909884354,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a35f3211-3b33-4826-97b8-3af69655dada,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small glass jar with a metal lid containing a porridge salé (savory porridge). The jar is placed on a car dashboard vent for scale, indicating the jar is relatively small. The diameter of the jar is likely around 6-7 cm, and it is filled nearly to the brim with porridge. Considering the density and texture of porridge, which is fairly dense due to oats being soaked and cooked with liquid, the weight of the contents can be estimated. The jar appears to hold roughly 150-200 ml in volume. Given that cooked porridge has a density slightly higher than water (close to 1 to 1.1 g/ml), the weight of the porridge inside should be near its volume in grams. Therefore, a plausible weight range for this portion is about 150-200 grams. Given the jar is nearly full and compact, I estimate the porridge salé weighs around 180 grams."
p8a2w5,pillons de poulet,48.0,180,132.0,0.27650010909884354,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/a80cc37c-4f30-4827-84cd-91a2f89042c2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows two chicken drumsticks (pillons de poulet) positioned on the plate alongside a small white bread roll and a salad containing tomato, mozzarella, and cucumber. The chicken pieces are medium-sized and appear to be grilled with a bit of visible seasoning. Each chicken drumstick typically weighs around 80-100 grams when cooked, depending on size and cooking method. These pieces are not particularly large or small but appear average in size for a typical Swiss portion. Given there are two pieces, a reasonable weight range would be between 150 and 200 grams in total. Considering their visual size and density, I estimate the total weight of the pillons de poulet as approximately 180 grams."
xjvrtk,tomates cerises,500.0,370,130.0,2.836569932358717,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/5ccbcf64-3631-48df-9e8a-85fb33dbf912,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a cardboard tray filled with cherry tomatoes (tomates cerises) still attached to their vine. There are approximately 21 cherry tomatoes visible, each medium-sized and round. Considering the typical weight of a cherry tomato is about 15-20 grams depending on size, and these appear mostly medium size, I estimate between 15 and 20 grams per tomato. Multiplying by the count (21 tomatoes), the total ranges from 315 grams to 420 grams. Given some variance and tomatoes not perfectly round or fully dense, a reasonable estimate is near the middle of this range, about 370 grams. The presence of the book and the textured cloth also supports that this is a standard portion size, not unusually large or small."
m4egh2,panais,13.0,135,122.0,0.0692123063495527,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/c31013e3-9c81-4ba6-b85b-e3c45b062457,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with a mixed roasted vegetable dish including potatoes, feta, carrots, parsnips (panais), eggplants, and beets. The parsnips are identifiable as medium-sized off-white thick slices scattered throughout the dish. The portion of parsnips is moderate, with about 6-8 visible pieces of varying sizes, each roughly 2-3 cm in length. Considering the density and volume of roasted parsnip pieces and their thickness, each piece likely weighs around 15-20 grams. Taking into account the visible pieces and some additional density of hidden pieces in the pile, I estimate the total parsnip weight to be approximately 120-150 grams. Given the portion size looks medium rather than very small or large, a reasonable estimate is 135 grams."

The ratatouille is visibly placed on the upper right area of the plate. It consists of diced cooked vegetables (zucchini, eggplant, tomato, and possibly peppers), which tend to lose water and shrink when cooked but remain dense. The portion looks moderate in size, about the volume of a small fist, roughly 7x5 cm in surface area, and about 2-3 cm in depth when considering layering. The density of cooked ratatouille vegetables is approximately 0.8 to 1.0 g/cm³. Estimating the volume around 70-90 cm³, this yields a plausible weight range of about 55-90 grams. Considering the fullness and plating, I select a final estimate near the middle of this range, about 75 grams. This aligns well with the size relative to the bulgur and egg on the plate and does not seem over- or underestimated."

The image shows a small serving of homemade hummus placed on a plastic blue lid, which provides a useful size reference. The hummus appears thick and dense, with roughly 5-6 scoops or dollops, closely packed but not overflowing. Considering the lid size is approximately similar to a small container lid (around 12 cm by 7 cm), the volume of hummus seems modest. Given the dense texture of hummus, a scoop this size typically weighs about 25-30 grams. Multiplying by the 5-6 scoops visible, the total weight likely ranges from 130 to 180 grams. I judge this portion as medium-sized for a spread or dip. Therefore, my final estimation for the weight of the 'humus maison' is approximately 155 grams."

The image shows a small ceramic bowl containing porridge as the major portion and a small dollop of almond puree ('purée d'amande') on one side of the bowl. The porridge fills approximately three-quarters of the bowl's volume, and the bowl itself appears small to medium in size, typically holding about 200-250 grams of food when full. Considering the porridge's somewhat dense and moist consistency, and the visible volume, a reasonable estimate for the porridge alone is about 150 to 180 grams. The almond puree portion is comparatively small and dense, roughly 20-30 grams. Given the focus is on the porridge, I exclude the almond puree weight from the porridge estimation. Thus, weighing all considerations, I estimate the porridge to be about 160 grams."

The image shows a slice of 'délice des dieux,' which is a dessert consisting of a biscuit base soaked with juice from red fruits, topped with a creamy layer of séré and mascarpone, and garnished with fresh red fruits (raspberries and blueberries). The piece appears to be approximately the size of a standard dessert portion, about 8 cm by 7 cm and about 2-3 cm thick. The biscuit base looks moist and dense, likely contributing significantly to the weight, while the mascarpone and séré cream layer adds volume but less density. The fresh fruits, including three raspberries and two blueberries, add a modest but notable contribution. Based on the plate size and texture cues, the portion seems medium-sized, not too large or small. The minimum to maximum plausible weight range is around 80 to 110 grams considering density and volume. A balanced final estimate accounting for biscuit density and creamy layers is approximately 95 grams."

The image shows a yellow bell pepper that has been roasted and is cut into three pieces, with the largest piece stuffed with a mix of quinoa and bulgur seasoned with curry. The stuffing looks fairly dense and fills the hollowed portion of the pepper completely and is slightly mounded. The pepper itself is medium-sized, typical for Switzerland, roughly 8-9 cm tall and 6-7 cm in diameter. The two pepper slices are roasted and softened but not very thick, contributing to weight. Considering the density of cooked quinoa and bulgur, which combined can weigh roughly 130-150 grams per cup (about 240 ml volume), and the filled volume that the pepper can hold, the stuffing is likely around 120-140 grams. The roasted pepper pieces themselves are smaller in volume and lighter, possibly around 40-50 grams total for the three pieces. Since the target food item is ""quinoa et boulgour au curry,"" only the stuffing weight counts. Therefore, a plausible weight range for the quinoa and bulgur stuffing is about 120-140 grams, and I estimate approximately 130 grams for this portion. This estimate takes into account the full filling visible, the density of the grain mix, and the typical size of the pepper."

The image shows a slice of tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe on a standard-sized dessert plate. The slice covers about half or slightly less than half of the plate surface. The tarte flambée dough is thin and slightly crispy, with a topping consisting mainly of diced rhubarb pieces mixed with a creamy base, possibly including apple pieces which seem well integrated and not bulky. The rhubarb pieces are small but numerous, giving some volume and weight. Considering the thinness of the dough and the density of the fruit topping, the slice looks like a medium portion for this type of dish. Swiss portion sizes for tarte flambée slices tend to be moderate. I estimate a plausible weight range between 120 and 170 grams. Settling on a value in the middle, taking account of the fruit density and dough size, I estimate the weight of this tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe slice to be approximately 145 grams."

The image shows a medium-sized bowl containing a mixture of rice and dahl de lentilles. The dahl is clearly seen as the orange lentil and vegetable mixture on top of and mixed with the rice. The portion appears to occupy around half of the bowl volume, with the dahl being thick and visibly dense with lentils and vegetables like carrots. Considering the bowl's size relative to the nearby fork and laptop keyboard, the bowl likely holds about 300-350 grams in total of food when full. Since the dahl de lentille portion is roughly half of the bowl's content but mixed, the visible amount of dahl is approximately 150-200 grams. Given the density and typical cooked weight of lentil dahl, I estimate the dahl de lentille to weigh around 180 grams."

The image shows two slices of spinach pizza on a standard-sized dinner plate. Each slice has a medium-thick crust, visible tomato sauce, cheese, and a moderate amount of cooked spinach. The size of each slice appears typical for a homemade or restaurant spinach pizza slice, roughly one-sixth of a 30cm (12 inch) pizza each. Considering typical weight of a pizza slice with toppings like cheese and spinach, including the density and moisture content of cooked spinach, each slice likely weighs between 110 to 140 grams. The two slices combined visually correspond to roughly 220 to 280 grams. Since the target is the pizza aux épinards portion visible, and these two slices seem to be the portion, I estimate the spinach pizza weight here to be approximately 250 grams for both slices combined."

The image shows three breaded fish fillets (poissons panés) on a standard-sized plate. Each fish fillet piece is roughly rectangular and typical in size for frozen breaded fish portions common in Switzerland. Each piece seems medium thickness, about 7-8 cm long and 4 cm wide, and not too thick. A typical single frozen fish fillet portion of this size generally weighs between 70 and 90 grams. Since there are three pieces of similar size, the total weight should be calculated accordingly. Visual fullness and uniformity of the pieces suggests they are whole fillets, not partial pieces. Therefore, the minimum-maximum range for the three pieces would be approximately 210 to 270 grams. Choosing a middle value leaning towards slightly lighter because the fillets appear not very thick, I estimate the total weight of the three poissons panés at around 240 grams."

The image shows a plate with cooked vegetables consisting of red beetroot pieces along with the chard stems and leaves (côtes de bette), some visible carrot slices, and possibly some fennel, all cooked together in a stew-like form. The cooked vegetables form a compact mound occupying roughly one-third of a standard dinner plate. Considering the density of cooked beetroot and chard stems which retain moisture and are quite dense after cooking, the portion is substantial. In terms of volume, it looks like about 200 to 280 grams of cooked vegetables. Given the visible size and density, I estimate the weight of the cooked vegetables (côtes de bette, betterave rouge, fenouil, carottes) to be approximately 240 grams."

The fallafels are clearly visible on the right side of the bowl, consisting of 8 round, cooked balls. Each fallafel appears to be medium-sized, roughly the size of a ping-pong ball, which typically weighs about 25-30 grams due to their dense chickpea base and cooking method. Considering the uniform size and that they look fully cooked but not overly large, a reasonable weight range per fallafel is 25-30 grams. Multiplying by 8 fallafels gives a total weight range of 200-240 grams. Taking a midpoint estimate for visual fullness and density, I estimate the total weight of the fallafels to be approximately 220 grams."

The image shows a plate with a small salad made of chopped cucumber and tomato pieces. The tomatoes are cut into irregular chunks, roughly 8 pieces visible, each about medium-small size, typical of a fresh tomato salad. Considering that cherry tomatoes weigh around 15g each and these chunks are part of larger slicing tomatoes, each piece might weigh approximately 15-20 grams due to their size and density. Multiplying by 8 pieces gives a range of about 120 to 160 grams. Since the portions are modest and the tomatoes do not appear overly dense or juicy beyond normal, a reasonable estimate is about 140 grams for the tomatoes."

The image shows a white bowl containing apricot-flavored industrial yogurt with visible chunks of apricot. The volume of yogurt in the bowl appears modest, filling about one-third to half of the bowl's capacity. A typical industrial single-serving yogurt pot contains around 125-150 grams of yogurt. Given that this is serving in a bowl and looks like about half a standard single serving, I estimate the quantity to be slightly less than a full pot. The apricot chunks appear evenly distributed but do not substantially increase the volume. Considering these factors and the visual depth of the content, a reasonable weight estimate ranges from 70 to 90 grams. Therefore, I select a final estimated weight of 80 grams for this portion."

The 'tofu à la mangue' is visible in the bottom-left corner as several yellowish cubes with a slightly spiced or marinated appearance. There are approximately 7-8 cubes that are roughly 3-4 cm in length each, packed without significant gaps. The tofu cubes look firm and moderately dense. Comparing their size to the sliced avocado and diced mango pieces nearby, each cube likely weighs about 25-30 grams. Totaling approximately 7 cubes at about 25 grams each yields around 175 grams, with a plausible range between 140 grams (if cubes are slightly smaller or less dense) and 200 grams (if cubes are dense and thick). The portion is medium to large given the container size and distribution. Therefore, I estimate the 'tofu à la mangue' weight as approximately 170 grams."

The chili portion occupies about half of the plate. The meat chunks (cervelas) are cut into medium-sized cubes, mixed with kidney beans and thick tomato-based sauce. Given the plate diameter is a common size (around 25-27 cm), the chili portion looks like a standard single serving. Chili is dense due to the meat, beans, and sauce. A typical cooked chili serving size visually comparable to this weighs between 250-300 grams. The portion is substantial, covering half the plate with some thickness and moisture visible. Therefore, estimating the chili weight around 280 grams fits well. This accounts for the volume and density, as well as the piece sizes of cervelas."
2ahgvr,brochette de boeuf,76.0,165,89.0,0.2951778311149902,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/5b8a0853-ecc4-4015-bc9a-2b50766f873a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The brochette de boeuf is visible on the plate as three sizable cubes of grilled beef on a skewer. Each piece looks roughly 3-4 cm cube, with a good thickness and a dense texture typical for grilled beef cubes. Beef is dense and heavy, and these pieces appear to be medium-sized chunks. Generally, each cube could weigh around 50-60 grams given their size and density. Multiplied by three cubes yields approximately 150-180 grams. Considering slight shrinkage from cooking and the piece consistency, a weight of around 165 grams is a balanced estimate. The other foods on the plate, such as the pasta salad, bread slice, merguez, and sauce, support this as a reasonable portion size relative to the plate area taken up by the meat chunklets."

The image shows a small green bowl containing three strawberries ('fraises'). The strawberries vary slightly in size; two are medium-large, and one is smaller. Considering an average strawberry weighs around 15-25 grams depending on size, the largest strawberry here looks to be about 25 grams, the medium one about 20 grams, and the smaller one around 15 grams. Summing these approximations, the total weight range would be approximately 50-65 grams. Given the visual fullness and typical density of strawberries with their leafy tops, a reasonable estimate falls near the middle of that range. Therefore, the estimated weight of the strawberries in the bowl is approximately 58 grams."
2ahgvr,salade de pâtes,112.0,25,87.0,0.42522365262928213,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a1dcaa3e-bad0-4d16-a8e3-c6217544e407,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a white plate with a small remaining portion of salade de pâtes (pasta salad) mostly consisting of penne pasta, some corn kernels, cherry tomato halves, and small bits of green herbs. The portion is scattered and minimal, likely just scraps left after most being eaten. Considering the typical weight of cooked pasta and the visible volume, this small amount appears to be about 20-30 grams. Penne pasta is moderately dense when cooked, and with the small additions of vegetables, the weight leans towards the upper part of that range. Given the visible portion size relative to the plate and that pasta salads tend to weigh less than they visually appear (because cooked pasta absorbs water but remains somewhat dense), I estimate the weight of this remaining salade de pâtes to be approximately 25 grams."
ppf8hc,pâtes carbonara,236.0,150,86.0,0.8857080514946541,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/4d4e6539-b86f-4019-b2aa-0c15dbce0667,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a white plate with a serving of pâtes carbonara, identifiable by the penne pasta coated in a creamy sauce with visible bits of bacon or pancetta. On top, there is a noticeable mound of grated gruyère cheese. Evaluating the pasta portion, it looks like a medium serving, spread across the plate but not piled very high, consistent with a moderate single meal portion. The quantity of pasta likely corresponds to about 140-170 grams of cooked pasta, considering its density and volume on the plate. The grated gruyère appears to be a generous sprinkling, roughly equivalent to a small handful, estimating between 25-35 grams. Given the limited thickness of the cheese layer, it does not seem excessive. Summing these, the pâtes carbonara (pasta, sauce, and bacon) portion without the cheese on top probably weighs around 150 grams. The cheese is a separate item, so for the food item 'pâtes carbonara', I estimate 150 grams. This estimate is plausible and consistent with typical Swiss meal portion sizes for this dish."
xjvrtk,aubergine au four,145.0,230,85.0,0.5378572987126337,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/9f3cc64b-7ef7-4fff-b125-8e011b8ffb93,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The aubergine au four consists of four slices of baked eggplant arranged on the right side of the plate. Each slice is thinly cut and visibly cooked down, which reduces its density and weight compared to raw eggplant. The slices are relatively long, about the size of half to two-thirds of the plate diameter. Given the shriveled appearance typical after baking, the total volume corresponds to about one medium-sized eggplant. A raw medium eggplant weighs around 300-400g; baking reduces water content and weight by approximately 30-40%. Considering this, the weight of the aubergine au four present should be in the range of 180-250 grams. The portion looks medium to large given it covers a significant plate area, so an estimate closer to the upper mid-range is appropriate. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the aubergine au four to be around 230 grams."

The image shows a bowl of rice noodles topped with a Thai-style mixture of pork and vegetables. The vegetables include broccoli, red pepper, carrots, mushrooms, peas, and eggplant pieces. The pork pieces are distributed throughout. The mixture appears to be in a thick sauce and covers a substantial portion of the bowl. Considering the density of cooked pork and vegetables, and the visible volume which covers about half the bowl with moderate thickness, I estimate the total weight of the 'mélange de porc et légumes façon thaï' to be between 180 and 230 grams. Choosing a mid-range value consistent with typical portion sizes in Switzerland and the visible amount, I estimate approximately 210 grams."

The image shows a plastic container filled with a portion of salade grecque (Greek salad), identifiable by diced cucumbers, red and yellow bell peppers, onions, olives, and pieces of feta cheese. The salad fills about half to two-thirds of a standard medium-sized rectangular container, with the cubes of vegetables and cheese packed fairly densely. Greek salad ingredients are moderately dense, with cheese and olives adding some weight. Considering the container's size (roughly 15 cm length, 10 cm width, 8 cm height) and its fill level, a typical portion like this could weigh between 200 to 250 grams. Judging the modest volume and mixed ingredients, I estimate the salad weight to be around 230 grams. The sauce à salade maison is not visually separated, so not included in this estimate."

The image shows a slice of rhubarb cake ('tranche gâteau rhubarbe') with a noticeable thickness and a good amount of rhubarb pieces on top. The triangular slice is about the size of a typical dessert portion on a square plate, roughly similar to a quarter of a standard round cake. The cake crust is visible and looks moderately thick. Rhubarb is fibrous and dense, but the cake base is lighter and less dense than the fruit topping. Considering similar French or Swiss cakes, a full rhubarb cake typically weighs around 700-900 grams. A quarter slice would be about 175-225 grams. Given the visible density and the good topping coverage, I estimate this particular slice weighs in the middle of that range, around 200 grams."

The image shows several slices of pear (poire) in a small clear plastic container. There are roughly six slices, some with skin and some without, arranged loosely in the container. Each slice appears to be of medium thickness and consistent size. Based on the typical density and weight of fresh pear (about 150-170g for a whole medium pear), these slices approximate a bit more than half a pear in total. Considering the volume filled in the container and the visible size, the reasonable minimum-maximum weight range for this portion is around 80-120 grams. Given the visual fullness and size, I estimate the total weight of the pear slices at approximately 100 grams."

The specified food item is ""sandwich jambon,"" which is the longer sandwich on the plate. It is made with a seeded, multigrain baguette-style bread, filled with slices of ham and some visible lettuce. The sandwich appears to be about 15-18 cm long, typical of a small to medium baguette sandwich in Switzerland. Given the bread type and density, plus the ham and lettuce filling, the sandwich is roughly medium-sized, with an average baguette sandwich weighing about 180-220 grams. Considering the visible portion and typical weight of similar sandwiches including the bread, ham, and some lettuce, I estimate the weight in the range of 180-210 grams, settling on 195 grams as a precise estimate."

The image shows a lunch box containing several food items: grilled aubergine, polenta with grated cheese, and a piece of pork topped with a white sauce. The pork portion is a single medium-sized piece, roughly the size of a palm, cooked but still visibly moist and tender. Given the size relative to the aubergine slices and the polenta mound, the pork piece looks like a standard serving. Typically, a single portion of cooked pork like this weighs between 100 and 150 grams. Considering the visible thickness and general dimensions, I estimate the pork piece to weigh around 130 grams. This fits plausibly with the other portion sizes in the box and does not seem oversized or too small."

The image shows a plate with distinct portions of six food items including diced red beetroot (betterave) in the upper left quadrant. The beetroot pieces are cut into medium-sized cubes, roughly 1.5 to 2 cm per piece. The pile occupies a solid quarter portion of the plate. Considering cooked beetroot is dense and moist, and comparing its volume to the other food items like quinoa and avocado on the plate, the beetroot portion appears to be medium-sized. The visible beetroot portion is consistent with about 120-160 grams in total, given that cooked diced beetroot weighs about 40-50 grams per 100 cm3 and the volume approximates roughly 3-4 cubic decimeters when compacted on the plate. Given these observations, I estimate the weight of the betterave on the plate to be around 140 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing a modest portion of plain yogurt (yogourt nature). The yogurt appears creamy and somewhat thick, occupying a small area at the base of a medium-sized bowl. Given the visible portion, the yogurt does not fill the bowl deeply and appears to be roughly a medium spoonful or two. Standard plain yogurt serving sizes typically range from 100 to 150 grams, but this portion is smaller than a typical single serving. Considering the bowl size and the relatively small mound of yogurt, I estimate the yogurt weight to be in the range of 80 to 110 grams. A reasonable middle value is about 95 grams, reflecting a small-to-medium portion."

The image shows a white square plate with a few small clusters of food items. The cherry tomatoes ('tomates cerises') are located in the bottom left corner of the plate. There are 5 whole cherry tomatoes visible, each appearing medium-sized and shiny. Typically, a cherry tomato weighs around 15-20 grams on average. Considering the size and assuming these are fresh and firm, the weight per tomato is about 18 grams as a reasonable midpoint. Multiplying by the count of 5 gives an internal range of approximately 70 to 90 grams. Given the neat arrangement and absence of cut or missing pieces, I estimate the total weight of the cherry tomatoes to be about 85 grams. This is consistent with the relative size of the tomatoes compared to the other foods on the plate, and the portion size seems modest but sufficient for a salad side."

The purée de pdt (mashed potatoes) is clearly visible as the base of the dish on the plate, appearing as a thick, smooth layer roughly the size of a medium palm and about 1.5-2 cm thick. The mashed potatoes cover a substantial portion of the plate area beneath the meat and carrots. Given the common density of mashed potatoes and the visible volume, I estimate the portion to be medium-sized but not overly large. The plate size and other components give scale, confirming this is a typical homemade serving in Switzerland. Based on volume and typical density, I estimate the mashed potatoes portion to weigh between 130 and 160 grams. I select the middle point as the final estimate: approximately 145 grams."

The image shows one single pancake on a plate with colorful fish decorations. The pancake appears to be of medium size, roughly 10-12 cm in diameter, with a typical thickness around 1.5 cm. The pancake has a light golden brown color and looks evenly cooked. Comparing its size to the plate and typical homemade pancakes in Switzerland, an average medium pancake generally weighs between 80 to 120 grams. This pancake looks neither overly thick nor thin, suggesting it is a standard homemade portion. Therefore, an estimated weight range of 90-110 grams is reasonable. Choosing a midpoint value, I estimate the pancake weighs approximately 100 grams."

The image shows a single whole cooked artichaut on a plate. Comparing the size of the artichoke to the hand holding the plate and the plate itself, this appears to be a medium-sized artichoke. A typical medium artichoke after cooking (without the stem) usually weighs between 180 to 250 grams as the leaves absorb water but also lose some mass during cooking. Given the size and fullness seen here, the artichaut looks closer to the middle of that range, not overly large or small. Therefore, a reasonable estimated weight range would be about 180-230 grams. Considering the visual density and size, I estimate the weight of this artichaut to be approximately 210 grams."

The waffle is standard size, approximately the size of a typical homemade or store-bought portion, about 10x15 cm in surface area and roughly 1.5 to 2 cm thick. Given that waffles are quite dense but aerated baked goods, their weight for this size typically ranges between 90 and 130 grams. This waffle looks freshly baked and of medium thickness. There is some apple compote on top, but as requested we estimate only the waffle weight. Considering the portion size and visual thickness, I estimate the waffle weighs about 110 grams, within a range of 100 to 120 grams as plausible minimum to maximum."

The image shows a plate with various salad components: shredded lettuce (salade), halved cherry tomatoes (tomate cerise), sliced avocado (avocat), flaked tuna (thon), and a generous layer of canned corn (maïs en boîte) on top. The corn kernels are relatively uniform in size and densely piled, covering much of the tuna and salad below. A typical canned sweet corn kernel weighs about 0.3 to 0.5 grams, and visually I estimate there are roughly 80 to 100 corn kernels visible here. This suggests the corn portion weighs roughly 25 to 40 grams. Considering some kernels may be hidden underneath and that the pile has moderate volume, I include a modest allowance and estimate a range of 30 to 50 grams. Given this is a medium-sized corn serving topping the salad, I conclude the mass to be about 40 grams. This estimate aligns well with the size of other salad components and does not appear over- or underestimated."

The image shows one whole nectarine placed on a wooden table. The nectarine looks like a medium-sized fruit, and there's a pencil nearby that provides a useful size reference. A standard pencil is about 19 cm long and the nectarine appears to be around one-third or slightly less of the pencil’s length in diameter, approximately 6-7 cm. Typical medium nectarines of this size usually weigh between 130 to 180 grams. Given the visible size and typical densities of nectarines, I estimate the weight to be around 160 grams as a reasonable middle value within this range."

The image shows two triangular pieces of bread ('pain') placed on a kitchen scale. The bread appears to be a medium thickness slice of a denser, brown bread typical in Switzerland. The size of each piece is roughly half of a standard slice of bread. A typical whole slice of this type of bread weighs about 30-40 grams, so two halves combined are roughly one slice. Considering the thickness and density of this bread, the total weight of these two halves appears to be about a full slice's weight. Since no other food item affects this weight reading directly, I estimate the total weight of the bread pieces shown to be around 35 grams, with a plausible range of 30-40 grams based on size and density."

The image shows a transparent container with two main visible food items: gnocchi au basilic and pieces of cooked cauliflower (chou-fleur), with some grated cheese (fromage râpé) sprinkled on top. The gnocchi are typical potato-based small dumplings infused with basil, looking soft and coated with some sauce, arranged at the bottom half of the container. Each gnocchi is approximately 3-4 cm long and they are crowded but not densely packed; I count about 15 visible gnocchi, with possibly a couple hidden under the cheese or cauliflower. Gnocchi typically weigh about 15-20 grams per piece when cooked, but since these look on the smaller side and infused with basil (likely reducing the weight slightly), I estimate 15 grams per gnocchi. Multiplying 15 gnocchi by 15 grams gives about 225 grams maximum. However, some gnocchi might be below or partially covered, so a plausible weight range would be 200 to 250 grams. I will choose 230 grams as a reasonable estimate. The cauliflower and cheese should not be included since the target is only the gnocchi au basilic. This estimate aligns with the container size and proportion of gnocchi compared to the cauliflower pieces and grated cheese, which cover but do not dominate the container."

The image shows two slices of bread ('pain') on a plate. Both slices appear to be standard medium-sized slices of country-style or rustic bread, with a thick crust and airy crumb. Each slice looks to be approximately 1.5 cm thick. Given typical Swiss bread slice weights, a standard slice of this type of bread weighs between 40 and 50 grams. Considering the two slices shown, the total weight of the bread is roughly double that of one slice, so about 80 to 100 grams in total. However, the prompt specifically asks for the weight of 'pain' as a food item, not distinguishing single or both slices. Since the list includes 'pain' twice, it is likely referring to the total visible amount of bread. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the bread slices in the image to be around 90 grams, which corresponds to two medium slices."

The pasta pieces appear broad, flat, and loosely piled in a small heap covering about 12-15 cm in length and a smaller width. Given the common density and volume of dry, wide pasta ribbons, this amount looks like a small to medium portion. Typically, a small handful of dry pasta, similar in size to this pile, weighs roughly between 40 and 60 grams. Given the visual volume and considering that the pasta is not tightly packed, I estimate the weight to be around 50 grams. This estimate aligns with the visible size compared to the garlic clove and tomato pieces as reference points."

This portion is roughly 10 cm long by 5-6 cm wide and about 2-3 cm thick, with a dense wet consistency. This resembles a typical overnight oats serving. Given the density and moisture absorption of soaked oats with chia, a portion this size likely weighs between 80 and 110 grams. Considering the portion is medium-sized — not too small or overly large — I estimate the weight to be around 95 grams. The presence of other toppings (peanut butter, chocolate chips, fruits) helps confirm the proportion allocated to the oat mixture on the plate is moderate and consistent with this range."

Given the volume visible and considering typical Swiss yogurt portions in such bowls, the yogurt content is substantial but not fully filling the bowl (since cereals and blueberries occupy space). The yogurt looks dense and creamy. A typical serving of yogurt is about 125-150g, but here, considering the bowl is filled with a combined mixture, the yogurt is likely about 100-130 grams to allow space for the other items. I estimate a range between 100g and 130g, choosing a final estimate of 115 grams as a medium portion that fits the visual evidence and typical serving sizes."

A medium carrot generally weighs between 60 and 80 grams. Here, the carrots appear to be fairly thick and fresh, without peeling losses visible, so the weight would be toward the upper part of this range. With two carrots visible, the total weight range is roughly 120 to 160 grams. Considering their size and apparent density, a reasonable estimate for the total weight of the carrots on the plate is about 140 grams."

Given typical granola cereals density and common portion sizes in Switzerland, a light breakfast portion of cereals in a bowl like this generally weighs between 25 and 40 grams dry. Considering the amount visible and that this is already mixed with milk, I estimate the cereals (without milk) to be around 30 grams."

Considering the bowl size (medium-sized) and assuming the portion is dense but not compacted, the cucumber pieces appear to make up roughly one quarter to one third of the salad volume. A medium cucumber typically weighs around 200-250 grams whole. Given that only portions of cucumber are visible mixed in the salad, I estimate about 80-110 grams of cucumber present in this bowl. This estimation accounts for visible pieces and a slight allowance for those partly covered or mixed in. This fits well with the quantity observed relative to the beetroot and other ingredients."

The potato salad portion is located in the bottom left corner of the plate, composed of circular potato slices covered in a creamy white sauce. The overall portion size is moderate, covering roughly one quarter of the plate. Each potato slice appears to be around 5-7 cm in diameter and around 0.5 cm thick, with a creamy dressing adding slight volume and density. Considering typical density of potato in creamy salad and the volume occupied, this portion looks like a medium serving commonly seen in Swiss home-style meals at lunch. The plate size can be roughly estimated to be around 24 cm by 24 cm, supporting the size assessment. Based on these visual cues, a reasonable weight range could be 130-180 grams. Since this portion is medium-sized but not overly heaped, an estimate near the middle of this range is appropriate. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'salade de pomme de terre' to be approximately 155 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing three distinct food items: cooked pasta, slices of gratinée courgettes, and a cream-based mushroom sauce. The target item is the sauce aux champignons. Visually, the mushrooms coated in creamy sauce are scattered mainly over the pasta portion. There are about 8 visible pieces of mushroom of medium size, cooked and covered with a cream-based sauce including garlic. The portion of sauce appears moderate in quantity, enough to coat the mushrooms and some pasta. Given the density of cooked mushrooms plus the cream sauce, the total visible combination likely weighs more than just mushrooms alone. Estimating individual mushroom slices at approximately 15 grams each when cooked and sauced, 8 pieces would be roughly 120 grams. Adding the cream sauce in between pieces and coating the pasta, a realistic estimate would be in the range 130-160 grams total. Considering the moderate volume and creamy consistency, I finalize the weight estimate at about 145 grams for the sauce aux champignons portion visible in the bowl."

Each croissant is relatively small, roughly the size of a palm or smaller, suggesting a petite portion typical for a snack or appetizer. Considering the light pastry dough and the filling, each small croissant likely weighs between 30 and 40 grams. Given four croissants, the total weight would be approximately 120 to 160 grams. Since the request is for the weight of one croissant, I estimate it at the medium point of the range, about 35 grams per croissant. This estimate fits the visible size, typical density of pastry with cheese filling, and the relative portion size compared to the plate and visible elements."

Cooked white rice has a density that allows about 130-150 grams per medium bowl half portion. Given the volume, the rice appears to be a medium portion size, not heaped nor sparse. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the rice portion in the bowl to be around 140 grams, with a plausible range from 130 to 150 grams depending on packing. This estimate fits well with the common serving sizes and relative volume compared to the adjacent lentil dalh, which is denser and more compact. Thus, final weight estimation for the rice is 140 grams."

The target food is the sliced tomato on the right side of the container. The tomato is medium-sized, sliced into about seven even slices stacked on top of each other. Comparing the size of the tomato slices to the wheat grains and the container dimensions, the tomato appears to be a little smaller than a typical medium tomato (which usually weighs about 150-170 grams when whole). Since it is sliced, the total visible tomato portion corresponds roughly to a medium tomato minus some core and seed loss visible. Each slice is moderately thick, with visible juice and flesh density typical of fresh tomatoes. Based on its size and volume, the total weight of the sliced tomato is likely within the 120-140 gram range.

The image shows a white plate with two pieces of baguette, two croissants au jambon, two radishes, sliced carrot sticks, apple slices, thin slices of salami and lard, and a rectangular piece of gruyère cheese. The 'bout de gruyère' is centrally placed and appears as a single rectangular slice approximately 12-13 cm long, about 2 cm wide, and roughly 1.5 cm thick. Gruyère is a dense cheese, and based on typical density and typical slice thickness, this portion is medium-sized. A similar-sized slice of gruyère usually weighs between 50 and 70 grams. Given the visible size and thickness, I estimate this piece weighs about 60 grams. This estimate makes sense given the other items on the plate and their relative sizes, with the cheese portion being a distinct, solid chunk but not overly large."

The salade de riz is located on the right side of the plate and is a mixed rice salad with visible grains of rice, small pieces of red pepper, and herbs. The portion size appears medium, roughly equivalent to a small scoop about 5-6 cm in diameter and 1-2 cm thick. Rice salad tends to be less dense than plain cooked rice because of the added vegetables and dressing, but still relatively dense compared to leafy salads. Given the size and volume, a reasonable weight range for this visible portion is between 80 and 110 grams. Considering the average density and the plate size context relating to the other foods, I estimate the weight of the salade de riz to be approximately 95 grams."

The image shows a black plate with two different dessert slices: tiramisu on the left and forêt noir on the right. The tiramisu slice is roughly rectangular, with a creamy layer on top that has cocoa powder sprinkled on it and visible soaked sponge layers underneath. Judging by the size relative to the plate and the forêt noir slice, the tiramisu portion looks like a medium dessert slice, approximately 7-8 cm in length, 3-4 cm wide, and about 3-4 cm thick. Tiramisu is relatively light due to its creamy mascarpone and soft sponge, but moisture adds some weight. This slice seems like it originally came from a standard-sized cake portion. The likely weight range for such a slice is between 90 grams (small-medium) and 130 grams (medium-large). Given the creaminess and thickness of the slice observed, a final estimate around 110 grams is plausible and consistent with the overall scale and size."

The image shows an open sandwich made with two slices of pain bis (brown bread). The right slice has several thin slices of fromage (cheese) arranged side by side, covering most of the bread surface. The cheese slices are about 1 cm wide and approximately 8 cm long, typical of sliced Swiss cheese. There are about 7 visible slices, fairly thin but not paper-thin. Considering that a standard slice of cheese for a sandwich weighs around 10-12 grams when cut thinly, and since these are somewhat thin, the total amount would range from about 60 to 85 grams. The 7 slices collectively cover the bread tightly without significant overlap, suggesting a medium portion rather than a very thick one. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the fromage on this sandwich to be approximately 75 grams."

The image shows a small bowl containing 4 visible pieces of mozzarella balls, along with cherry tomatoes and basil leaves. Mozzarella balls appear to be small-sized bocconcini, typical individual balls weighing around 15-20 grams each. Considering the visible size and quantity, these mozzarella balls look fresh and moist, and the density is typical for fresh cheese. Since they are 4 visible pieces in a small bowl, a reasonable total weight range would be between 60 and 80 grams. Choosing a midpoint estimate reflecting the portion size as medium-small, I estimate the mozzarella weight to be around 70 grams."

The target food is 'sauce salade' visible as a white creamy dressing poured over several slices of cucumber on the plate. The quantity covers about 4 thin cucumber slices, with a small pool that is likely around 1 cm deep on average. Given that salad sauces are dense and creamy, but the overall volume is small, I estimate this portion to be small to medium. The sauce covers roughly 3-4 tablespoons in total (both the visible part on cucumbers and some spread beyond). A tablespoon of salad sauce typically weighs between 12 to 15 grams. Therefore, estimating about 3 tablespoons yields a range of approximately 35 to 45 grams. The portion is moderate but not large, so I choose a middle value around 40 grams to represent the visible amount well. This estimate aligns well with the small amount visually compared to other foods on the plate, such as the rice salad and pasta salad."

The image shows a single scoop of vanilla ice cream ('boule de glace vanille') presented in a bowl alongside homemade strawberry-rhubarb compote and hot chocolate sauce. The ice cream scoop is roughly spherical and appears to be a standard single serving size, typical in Swiss dessert portions. The diameter of the scoop is around 5-6 cm, which usually corresponds to about 80-100 grams of ice cream. Given it is a single scoop and appears well-shaped and solid (not melting significantly), it is appropriate to consider a medium portion size within that range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the boule de glace vanille to be approximately 90 grams."

The image shows four pieces of sweet potato waffles ('gaufre à la patate douce') on a plate, each topped with a layer of cream sauce and slices of smoked salmon. Each waffle piece is roughly 7-8 cm wide and about 1.5 cm thick. Considering that a typical whole sweet potato waffle before cutting weighs approximately 100-130 grams, and here we have four quarters (so a whole waffle portion), the total weight of the waffles alone would be around 100-130 grams. Adjusting for moisture loss during cooking and the waffle's slightly dense but airy texture, I estimate the weight of the sweet potato waffle portion visible in the image to be around 120 grams in total. Since the quantity on the plate corresponds to one whole waffle cut into four pieces, the weight estimate aligns well with typical sweet potato waffle sizes in Switzerland. Therefore, the estimated weight for the 'gaufre à la patate douce' is approximately 120 grams."

The '2eme poulet' refers to the second portion of chicken visible on the plate, which is the yellowish skewer in the middle. It consists of several grilled chicken pieces on a wooden skewer, showing a medium portion size. By comparing it to the first skewer (orange chicken pieces, likely similar in size), and considering typical Swiss serving sizes for skewered chicken pieces, each skewer usually weighs around 80-100 grams depending on thickness and quantity of meat. This skewer has about 4-5 chunks of chicken, appearing moderately thick but not overly dense. Therefore, the internal plausible weight range is approximately 70-90 grams. Given the moderate size and visible portion, a final estimate of about 80 grams is appropriate."

The white sauce (sauce blanche) is visible poured over the portion of pork in the metal container. It appears creamy and reasonably thick, covering a piece of meat that seems to be medium-sized. Given the spoon/plate size and container, the sauce covers roughly the top surface of the pork piece, extending slightly beyond. Standard creamy mustard sauces have a density close to that of cream. Estimating portion size, the volume of sauce looks like about 3 to 4 tablespoons, which typically weigh around 15-20 grams each. Thus, the sauce likely weighs between 45 and 80 grams. Given the visual portion, I estimate about 60 grams of sauce blanche for this dish."

The image shows three bread rolls on a white surface. Two of them are likely brioche au chocolat, identifiable by their smooth, golden-brown crust and visible chocolate pieces embedded in the dough. The third roll, which is more textured and darker with visible walnut pieces, is likely the pain aux noix. Each brioche au chocolat appears medium-sized, around the size of a small palm, typical for single-serving bakery goods. A standard brioche au chocolat of this size usually weighs between 65 to 90 grams. Given the visual size and density of the rolls, I estimate the weight of one brioche au chocolat to fall within this range. To be precise, estimating around 80 grams is reasonable since they seem well-formed but not very dense or heavy. This estimate also fits proportionality relative to the pain aux noix visible, which is usually heavier due to added nuts and denser dough. Therefore, the estimated weight for one brioche au chocolat is 80 grams."

The image shows some peanuts (cacahuètes) inside a glass bottle. The peanuts fill approximately the lower quarter of the bottle's volume. Given the standard density and size of roasted peanuts, and estimating the bottle size to be similar to a small milk bottle (about 250-300 ml total volume), the amount of peanuts in the bottle corresponds roughly to 60-80 grams in total. Considering volume packing and density of peanuts, a medium portion like this is closest to around 70 grams. This estimate aligns with the visible portion size and the container size without overestimation."

The image shows a white plate containing three distinct foods: cottage cheese, a potato salad (salade de pomme de terre), and green salad leaves (salade verte). The cottage cheese portion is a distinct small mound on the top right of the plate. Cottage cheese is quite dense and moist, so its volume does not correspond to a large weight. The portion looks like a moderate spoonful, roughly about 3 to 4 tablespoons in size, which typically weigh between 40 and 60 grams. Given the size relative to the potato salad, and the fact it is not heaped high, I estimate the cottage cheese to weigh approximately 50 grams. This estimate fits well with the visual portion size and typical density of cottage cheese servings in Switzerland."

The image shows a standard white plate with a slice of pain provencal bread on the right side. The bread slice is medium-sized, roughly comparable to the size of the cheese slices on the left side. The bread shows seeds inside and has a typical thickness for a sliced bread portion. Standard pain provencal slices usually weigh between 35g to 50g depending on thickness and density. Given that this slice appears to be about average in thickness with a moderate crumb density and visible seeds, and is not very thick, I estimate the weight to be in a range around 40 to 45 grams. This fits well with typical Swiss portion sizes for bread slices of this appearance. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this pain provencal slice as 43 grams."

The image shows a galette wrap with visible slices of avocado on top. There appear to be about three moderate-sized slices of avocado covering roughly a third of the wrap's surface. Given the average size of avocado slices and typical avocado weight, a medium avocado weighs about 150-200 grams whole. Three slices likely represent around one-third to one-half of an avocado. This suggests the avocado portion weighs between 50 and 90 grams. Considering the slices are not very thick but are of decent size, a reasonable estimate lies near the middle of this range. Thus, I estimate the avocado portion in the wrap to be around 70 grams."

The image shows a small glass jar containing crème caramel, with only a small portion left at the bottom. The amount visible is quite limited and appears to be roughly 2-3 cm in height spread across the base of the jar. Typically, a full small glass jar of crème caramel weighs around 120-150 grams. Given that less than one-quarter of the jar is filled, the weight of the visible crème caramel is likely around 25-40 grams. Considering the volume and density of this custard-like dessert, a reasonable estimate is about 30 grams."

The image shows a clear glass bottle labeled 'GINGER' with some tonic ginger beer or ginger tonic inside. The bottle appears to be a standard small glass beverage bottle, which commonly holds around 200 to 250 ml in Swiss or European contexts. Since the density of tonic or ginger beer is close to water, the weight in grams will be close to the volume in milliliters. Given the visual fill level appears about three-quarters full, the liquid content corresponds roughly to 150 to 180 grams. The bottle itself may be around 200 to 250 grams including glass but we exclude the container weight. Considering the visible content and the typical size, I estimate the weight of the 'tonic au gingembre' liquid to be about 170 grams."

The image shows a bowl with milk and cereals, which appear to be chunky granola clusters with some chocolate pieces. The bowl is medium-sized, and the visible cereal portion covers roughly a quarter to a third of the bowl’s surface, with milk soaking the cereals. Considering the typical density of granola clusters and some chocolate pieces, and the visual volume of the clusters which are relatively chunky but not densely packed, I estimate that the amount of dry cereal before milk absorption would be around 30-40 grams. Given the milk presence and some pieces submerged, the weight of the cereal alone (dry weight) is likely closer to 35 grams. This estimate aligns with typical serving sizes for cereal bowls in Switzerland, which tend to be modest. Thus, the final estimated weight of the cereals is 35 grams."

Focusing on the bulgur, it occupies about one third of the container, with a somewhat fluffy but dense appearance typical of cooked bulgur. The container seems to be a standard meal prep dish (likely around 1 liter volume). The bulgur portion depth appears moderate, approximately 2 to 3 cm thick. Based on similar bulgur servings in Swiss meal prep portions, this quantity likely ranges between 120 to 160 grams. Given the volume and typical density of cooked bulgur, I estimate the weight of the bulgur portion to be about 140 grams, fitting well within the reasonable 120-160 g range."

The image shows a blue plate with three different food items: haricots rouges (kidney beans), pâtes (pasta), and mozzarella. The mozzarella is the white creamy portion placed on top of the pasta. It appears as a small dollop rather than a full ball or chunk. Given the visible size relative to the pasta spirals and the other items, the mozzarella portion looks like about 1 to 2 tablespoons of soft cheese. Considering the density of mozzarella (especially fresh or creamy types), a tablespoon of soft mozzarella weighs roughly 15 to 25 grams. The dollop is moderately sized but not very large, so an estimated range of 20 to 30 grams is plausible. I select a value near the middle, about 25 grams, which fits the visual size and typical serving portion for a small topping of mozzarella on pasta."

The slice of bread is a typical small-medium slice, and the caviar d'aubergine is spread evenly but not thickly, covering most of the slice surface. Given the density and moisture content of eggplant caviar, and the spread thickness here, this amount likely weighs less than 50 grams but more than a thin smear. Considering the slice size and the spread volume, a reasonable weight range is between 30 to 45 grams. I estimate the caviar d'aubergine portion to be approximately 37 grams, taking a medium value in this range."

The mozzarella appears whole and is about the size of a medium small ball, with a smooth, moist texture typical of fresh mozzarella. The size relative to the olives and plate indicates it's neither a large mozzarella ball nor a tiny piece. Typical fresh mozzarella balls served in portions range between 80 to 125 grams for this size. Considering it doesn't look overly thick or densely packed but is a substantial portion, a plausible weight range is 90 to 110 grams. I estimate the mozzarella weighs approximately 100 grams."

The target food is 'glace sorbet framboise', which is visibly served in a small paper cup next to a whole apple. Comparing the size of the cup to the apple, the cup appears to be a small single-serving size, typically used for about 100-150 ml of ice cream or sorbet. The sorbet is dense and fills the cup almost fully, with a smooth and slightly glossy texture typical of fruit sorbets. Given the density of sorbet (close to that of water but slightly denser due to sugar content), 100-150 ml roughly corresponds to 90-140 grams. Considering that the cup is quite full but not overfilled, a weight estimate in the middle of this range is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the raspberry sorbet to be approximately 120 grams."

Given the plate size and the portion volume relative to the other foods (courgettes gratinée and mushroom sauce), the pasta occupies about one third of the plate area with some layering. Considering typical density and Swiss portion sizes, the visible amount of pasta would weigh between 90 and 130 grams. This is a medium portion for an individual meal and accounts for the pasta thickness and some sauce absorption. Therefore, an accurate estimate would be around 110 grams."

Considering the texture and the density of tofu mixed with mango pieces, the density is similar to firm tofu, which generally weighs about 1 g/cm³. Each slice volume is approximately 7.5 x 3 x 1.5 = 33.75 cm³, so roughly 34 grams per slice. Two slices together weigh about 68 grams. Given the visible portion is fully shown and not layered, the plausible weight range can be 60-75 grams. I estimate the weight of the tofu à la mangue to be approximately 68 grams, which fits the size and density visually."

The image shows a plate with two main food items: a grilled slice of aubergine (eggplant) and a piece of cooked chicken ('poulet'). The chicken piece appears to be a small but thick section from a larger piece, roughly the size of a small chicken breast chunk about 5-6 cm long and 3 cm thick. Given typical density and muscle tissue, such a piece generally weighs between 50 and 70 grams. The aubergine slice, by comparison, is about 1 cm thick but lighter in density. Since the target food is 'poulet', the focus is the chicken piece only. Based on visual size, density, and comparison to the aubergine slice, the weight range likely lies between 55 and 65 grams. Considering it is just a modest piece and looks cooked (which slightly reduces weight), I estimate the weight of the chicken piece to be 60 grams."

The image shows a whole, uncut apple ('pomme') being held in a person's hand. The apple appears medium-sized, slightly round with a red and yellow skin typical of common apple varieties in Switzerland. By comparing the apple's size to the person's hand, the apple likely has a diameter of about 7-8 cm, which is a typical size for an average apple. A medium apple of this size generally weighs around 150-180 grams. Since it is a single whole piece and looks dense and fresh without visible damage or dehydration, my plausible weight range is 150-180 grams. Given its medium size and apparent density, a suitable estimate is about 165 grams."

The chou romanesco is located at the top right part of the plate, with visible green fractal-shaped florets in moderate quantity. This portion seems to be cooked and slightly compacted but not densely packed. It occupies roughly one-fourth of the plate surface area. Considering the size of a standard dinner plate (about 25 cm diameter), and the volume occupied by the romanesco, I estimate the portion to be medium-sized but not large. Cooked cruciferous vegetables like romanesco tend to be dense and retain some water but still weigh less than they appear volumetrically. A medium portion of cooked romanesco typically weighs between 80 and 120 grams. Given the visible quantity and the moderate compaction, I estimate the weight to be around 100 grams, which fits well in the visual proportion relative to the other foods on the plate."

The image shows a small glass bowl containing chocolate yogurt, with swirls of light and darker chocolate colors. The quantity appears to fill the bowl about halfway, with a smooth and creamy texture typical of yogurt. Considering the size of a typical small glass bowl (approximately 10 cm diameter) and the volume of yogurt present, it suggests a small to medium portion. Chocolate yogurt is dense but not heavy, roughly 1 gram per milliliter. Given the visual volume, the weight likely ranges between 120 to 170 grams. I estimate it closer to the middle of this range at approximately 150 grams, which is reasonable for the visible amount and consistent with typical portion sizes in Switzerland."

The cervelas are visible as meat chunks within the chili on the right side of the plate. They are medium-sized cubes embedded in the chili, which contains sauce and kidney beans. Given the size and density of the cervelas pieces relative to the plate and the total chili portion, they likely weigh collectively less than the pasta portion but still form a significant part of the chili. Considering the typical density and size of cervelas chunks in a chili dish and comparing to known serving sizes, the cervelas pieces amount to approximately 90-120 grams. Because the portions cover most of that half of the plate and their volume in relation to other components, a reasonable estimate is about 105 grams for the cervelas."

The specified food item is 'agneau,' which is visible on the plate as a single small, sausage-like piece of grilled lamb meat positioned to the left of the chicken pieces. Its size is approximately 6-7 cm in length and relatively narrow, consistent with a small lamb sausage or a small portion of minced lamb meat formed into a compact shape. Lamb meat is dense and slightly fatty, so the weight can be estimated by comparing this piece to the chicken pieces next to it, which look like small, bite-sized chunks weighing roughly 20 grams each. The lamb piece appears to weigh less than two of those chicken pieces combined. Based on visual estimation and typical density, the lamb portion is likely between 30 and 45 grams. Given the small but solid size, I estimate it closer to 40 grams. This estimate aligns with the scale of the other components on the plate and the overall portion size presented."

The image shows two pieces of breaded chicken fillet ('filet de poulet pané') placed in a glass container with cooked basmati rice and sliced carrots. The chicken fillets appear medium-sized: the larger piece is about 10-12 cm long and the smaller piece about 7-8 cm. Breaded chicken fillets typically weigh around 100-150 grams for a medium piece. Here, the two pieces together seem to represent roughly one standard portion, with the smaller piece about half the size of the large one. Considering the visual thickness and density of breaded chicken, and comparing size with the rice grains and carrot slices, I estimate a total weight range of 140-180 grams for both pieces combined. Selecting a value towards the middle of this range, the estimated weight for the 'filet de poulet pané' is approximately 160 grams."

The image shows two slices of pain au céréales (multigrain bread) on a small plate. The slices are thin and elongated, typical of a baguette-style bread with a lot of air holes in the crumb, which reduces density. Each slice is roughly the size of a small bread slice, with one end thinner than the other. Considering the visible bread texture and size relative to the small plate and the plastic fork next to it, each slice weighs about 30-40 grams. Since there are two slices, the total weight of pain au céréales is likely between 60 and 80 grams. The chocolate spread is thinly applied and does not add significant weight to the bread itself, which is the target food. Hence, an estimated total weight for the bread slices is approximately 70 grams."

The image shows a slice of tarte aux fraises with a visible crust base, a creamy filling, and topped with fresh strawberries and some redcurrants. The slice is on a standard-sized dessert plate, providing scale. The strawberry pieces are medium-sized and cover the top of the tart slice generously, indicating a substantial fruit portion. The crust looks thin but dense, with some breaking off on the plate. Considering the typical density of a strawberry tart slice with cream, the combined weight is moderate. The portion appears medium-sized but not overly thick or large, likely between 120 and 160 grams. Given the visible fruit amount, crust, and cream, I estimate the weight to be approximately 140 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread on a white plate. Each slice is reasonably thick and looks similar to a typical French or Swiss country bread slice. The slices are not large, roughly similar in size to common sandwich bread slices used in Switzerland, around 12 cm by 7 cm. Given the thickness and density typical for this kind of bread, an average slice weighs about 40-50 grams. Since this slice appears to be medium thickness and is intact without large holes, it is reasonable to estimate toward the middle of the range. Also, visible butter and spread do not add much weight to the bread itself, so butter cannot be counted here. Therefore, for one slice of this 'pain', I estimate roughly 45 grams. The range considered was approximately 40-50 grams, and 45g is a suitable precise estimate."

The image shows a plate with multiple food items including penne pasta, gratin de côtes de bettes, chou romanesco, parmesan cheese, and a clearly visible steak végétarien topped with a brown onion sauce and some grated parmesan. The steak végétarien is a compact, round patty with a diameter of about 10 cm and thickness around 1.5 cm, appearing dense but plant-based. Typical vegetarian steaks of this size generally weigh between 100 and 150 grams. Considering it is covered by a moderate amount of sauce but not overly thick or large, I estimate the weight to be medium-sized, about 130 grams. This fits visually with the other components of the plate and seems reasonable given the size and relative scale compared to pasta and other items. The visible portion looks typical for a single serving, not a mini or oversized portion."

The lard on the plate consists of three visible pieces of cooked fatty pork rind or pork crackling, placed near the upper right section of the plate. Each piece looks fairly thin but with visible crisp texture and some fat content, typical for lard cracklings. The largest piece is about 6-7 cm long and the other two are smaller, roughly 3-4 cm each. Given the density and visible size, each piece likely weighs about 15-20 grams, considering pork crackling is quite dense and fatty yet light compared to pure muscle meat. Summing the three pieces suggests a total weight in the range of 45-60 grams. Given their moderate thickness and texture, I estimate the total weight of the lard to be around 53 grams."

The image shows two fried eggs (œuf au plat) on a plate beside cooked sliced red beet and sardines in tomato sauce. Both eggs appear to be standard size, likely from medium-sized eggs typical in Switzerland. Each fried egg, including the white and yolk, generally weighs around 50 grams. The two eggs together appear fully cooked, not overly thick or thin, and occupy a moderate portion of the plate. Considering no parts are missing or hidden, and the eggs are flat, I estimate the total weight of the two œufs au plat to be around 100-110 grams. This is consistent with two average medium-sized fried eggs. Thus, a precise estimate would be 105 grams."

The image shows a piece of tresse au beurre (a type of braided butter bread) and a slice of gruyère. The tresse au beurre piece is roughly the size of a small bread roll and has a dense, soft interior typical of this bread. Given the size relative to the slice of gruyère (which measures approximately 7 cm by 3 cm), the volume and density suggest a weight between 60 and 90 grams. The portion appears medium-sized — not a small crumb nor a full large chunk. Considering typical density and the visual portion, I estimate the tresse au beurre weighs approximately 75 grams."

The image shows a single slice of toasted bread spread with Nutella. The bread slice appears to be a relatively small piece, roughly half the size of a typical slice of sandwich bread, and the Nutella spread is fairly even and moderately thick. A standard slice of bread weighs about 30 grams, but since this is a smaller piece likely around half of that, the bread weight is approximately 15 grams. The Nutella layer on top looks like a moderate spread amount, likely around 12-15 grams given typical thickness and coverage. Adding them together, the total weight of the tartine Nutella is around 27-30 grams. Considering this, I estimate the tartine Nutela weight at approximately 28 grams."

The image shows a purple bowl containing several food items: green beans (haricots coco), shrimp (crevettes), and pearl wheat (perle de blé) with a saffron cream sauce. The pearl wheat is the yellowish grain visible mixed with the sauce and shrimp. It appears to fill about half of the bowl's volume, partially spread under the green beans. Considering the bowl is medium-sized and the pearl wheat is cooked (hence hydrated), its density is moderate. The portion seems to be a single serving with an estimated volume around 150 to 200 grams, given the pearl wheat's cooked volumetric expansion but relatively moderate weight. Given the visible amount, a plausible weight range for the pearl wheat is about 140 to 180 grams. I estimate the most accurate weight at around 160 grams, accounting for visual fullness, hydration level, and typical serving sizes in Switzerland."

The image shows a peeled banana segment placed on a dark surface. The banana piece appears to be about half the length of an average full banana and is of standard thickness for a banana. A typical medium banana in Switzerland weighs approximately 120-130 grams with skin; peeling it reduces weight by about 12-15%. Given this is about half a banana without the peel, I estimate the weight to be roughly half of 110 grams (average peeled banana weight), so about 55 grams. Considering minor variation in size and density, a plausible range would be 50-60 grams, with 55 grams as the best estimate."

The image shows a bowl with two food items: white rice on the left and a coral lentil dahl with visible chunks of carrots and onions on the right. The bowl is medium-sized and quite deep, and the dahl occupies roughly half the volume of the bowl. Dahl is a dense, cooked legume dish, usually moist and quite heavy due to lentils, cooked vegetables, and sauce. Considering the volume and density, the portion looks moderate but substantial. Estimating the depth and amount, the dahl portion is likely between 220g and 280g. Given visual fullness and the typical density of such a dish, a middle value of 250g is a reasonable estimate for the weight of the dalh de lentilles corail in this bowl."

The specified food item is 'pain tartiné au pesto'. The image shows three small slices of bread (likely baguette slices) each spread with pesto. Each slice looks thin, approximately 5 cm in diameter. A typical small baguette slice weighs around 10 grams. There are three slices, so that is about 30 grams of bread in total. The pesto is generously applied but in a thin layer. A thin spread of pesto on a small bread slice typically adds around 3-4 grams of pesto per slice. Therefore, pesto for three slices would weigh about 9-12 grams. Adding bread and pesto together, the total weight for the 'pain tartiné au pesto' is in the range of approximately 39 to 42 grams.

The image shows a yellow bell pepper (poivron jaune) that has been roasted and cut into pieces, with the main part stuffed with a quinoa and bulgur curry mixture. The visible yellow pepper consists of one half used as a container and two smaller slices on the plate. Considering the typical size of a medium yellow bell pepper in Switzerland, which weighs around 150-180 grams when raw, roasting reduces water content but the overall mass remains similar minus some moisture loss. The cut-off slices look like about a third of a pepper, and the remaining hollow half contains the filling. The total visible pepper portions therefore appear to be almost a full pepper minus the seeds and core, so approximately 120-140 grams in total. Considering the visible pieces and shrinkage from roasting, a reasonable range for the yellow pepper portion shown is 120 to 140 grams.

Considering that pasta with sauce and cheese plus tuna and peas is somewhat dense but includes low-weight vegetables, and given the portion size occupying only the center of a standard-sized dinner plate (approx 25 cm diameter), this is definitely a small to medium portion typical for a light meal in Switzerland. Based on visual volume and density, a typical estimate for such a portion would be around 150 to 200 grams. I select a middle value of about 175 grams for this portion, balancing the visible volume and ingredients' densities."

The image shows two strawberries ('fraises') placed on a wooden surface. Both strawberries appear to be medium-sized with typical density and shape for fresh strawberries. A medium strawberry generally weighs between 15 to 25 grams depending on size and ripeness. Given that these two strawberries look slightly on the smaller to medium side but still plump and fresh, I estimate each strawberry to weigh about 18-20 grams. Therefore, the total weight for the two strawberries would be around 36-40 grams. Choosing a precise value within this range, an estimate of 38 grams is reasonable and consistent with visual size and typical strawberry weights in a Swiss context."

Each slice appears to be of standard thickness, typical of a sliced loaf of whole wheat or country bread common in Switzerland. Each slice is roughly 10-12 cm in length and about 7-8 cm in width. Toasted bread has slightly less moisture than fresh bread but similar mass overall. A typical slice of this type of bread weighs approximately 40-50 grams before toasting. Given that toasting likely reduces moisture content slightly but doesn't remove significant weight, each slice should weigh about 40-45 grams. The image shows two slices, but the question is about one slice. Therefore, the estimated weight of one slice of pain is about 43 grams, within a plausible range of 40 to 45 grams."

The tomato pieces are cut into medium-sized wedges and spread over the plate in a single layer, revealing a substantial but not overly large portion. The plate is a standard dinner plate (about 25 cm diameter), and the tomatoes appear fresh and juicy with visible internal texture. Considering typical density and typical weight of tomato wedges, the whole portion of tomatoes likely represents about 3 medium tomatoes worth of weight. Given that a medium tomato weighs approximately 120-150 grams, this would suggest a range of approximately 360-450 grams. The flax seeds and balsamic vinegar contribute negligible weight compared to the tomatoes. Taking into account the volume visible and the density of tomatoes, the weight of the 'salade de tomates' is estimated around 400 grams, within a plausible range of 360-450 grams."

Its size is relatively small compared to the other cheese pieces and the baguette slice, approximately 3-4 cm in length and 2-3 cm in width with a height of about 1.5-2 cm. Fresh goat cheese (chèvre frais) is soft and moderately dense, and fig pieces increase the mass slightly. Given the dimensions and density, the fromage de chèvre frais à la figue appears to weigh in a modest range of about 25 to 35 grams. Accounting for thickness and slight compaction of the fig, choosing a mid-value is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the weight to be approximately 30 grams."

Considering the amount of perle de blé and shrimp in the bowl and the coverage of the sauce surrounding these ingredients, the sauce appears to cover about half the volume of the dish but is a liquid/creamy consistency, lighter than the solid components in weight per volume. The bowl is medium-sized and contains approximately 200-250 grams total of food, considering the volume of green haricots coco on the side is separate and denser. The sauce will likely be about 40-60 grams, given its creamy nature and visible proportions with the rest of the food.

By estimating the container size (approximately 15x15 cm square and about 6-7 cm high) and the quantity visible, the total dish weight could be roughly 350-400 grams. Visually, tuna accounts for roughly 20-25% of the volume, considering it is interspersed among couscous and vegetables. Tuna flakes are dense and heavier than couscous grains. Given this, the weight of the tuna pieces present is best approximated in the range of 70-100 grams. Considering the portion size and density, I estimate the tuna weight to be about 85 grams."

The slice appears to be a piece of baguette or similar bread, roughly 10 cm long and around 4-5 cm wide. A typical slice of this size weighs about 15-20 grams. The butter and chestnut cream are spread lightly but covering most of the surface, with the chestnut cream likely adding moisture and density, while butter adds some fat weight. Generally, a thin spread of butter might be around 5 grams and the chestnut cream layer about 8-10 grams for such a small portion. Considering the visible thickness and coverage, a plausible range for the tartine with coatings would be around 28-35 grams in total. Since the target food is 'tartine avec crème de marrons et beurre' (the whole item), the best estimate combining bread and spreads is about 32 grams, fitting the visual evidence and reasonable portion size for Switzerland.

The image shows a small white bowl filled with muesli nature. The bowl is about the size of the apple next to it, which helps gauge portion size. The muesli fills approximately half of the bowl's visible depth with clusters of oats and grains. Given that dry muesli is relatively light but compact, a medium portion like this typically weighs around 40 to 60 grams. Considering the bowl size, the visible fullness, and typical Swiss portion standards, I estimate the weight of the muesli nature to be about 50 grams."

The image shows a very small remaining portion of green salad with some dressing on a white plate. The leaves appear fresh but only cover a small central area of the plate, with some overlapping but largely spread thinly. Typically, a full typical green salad serving would weigh around 50-70 grams. Given the small amount visible here, representing only a few leaves, the portion looks more like a small leftover or side garnish rather than a full portion. Considering the light density of leafy greens and the small volume seen, the weight is likely in a very low range, roughly between 5 and 10 grams. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this leftover green salad with dressing to be about 7 grams."

The image shows a small piece of hard cheese ('fromage pâte dure') on a plate next to half an apple. The cheese piece is relatively thick and dense, with some cracks typical of hard cheese texture, and measures about the length of a small slice roughly 4 to 5 cm in length. Given the density of hard cheese, a piece of this size would typically weigh between 25 to 40 grams. Considering the visible size and thickness, the portion looks medium-sized rather than a small nibble or very large chunk. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the hard cheese to be approximately 32 grams."

The image shows a small bowl containing five black olives. The olives are fairly large in size, typical of kalamata or similar varieties, and look fleshy and plump. Average whole black olives weigh about 4 to 6 grams each. Given the visible five olives, and assuming no water or brine weight included, the total weight likely ranges between 20 grams (5x4g) and 30 grams (5x6g). Given their size and plump appearance, estimating towards the higher end seems reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the olives to be approximately 28 grams."

The image shows a glass jar containing a mixture of yogurt, oats, chia seeds, and other ingredients. The chia seeds are visible dispersed throughout the mixture and appear as small black specks evenly distributed in what looks like an overnight oats preparation. Given the size of the jar, which is about the size of a typical small mason jar (approximately 300-350 ml capacity), and the visible layer thickness of the mixture, the total weight of the chia seeds used is likely moderate. Chia seeds are dense but used sparingly in such recipes, usually in the range of 15-25 grams per serving. Considering the visible chia seed density in the mix and that it's not heavily layered, a plausible weight range would be about 15 to 20 grams. I estimate the weight of the chia seeds present here to be approximately 18 grams."

The image shows one slice of whole grain or multigrain bread with a layer of Nutella spread. The slice looks medium thickness, typical for a single slice of bread used in Switzerland. Considering the size relative to the spoon and the berries, the slice is about average size for a bread slice. Standard weight for such a bread slice is commonly around 35-45 grams depending on thickness and bread density. Since the slice appears regular and not overly thick or thin, I estimate the bread slice weighs about 40 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing a pinkish cherry yogurt ('yogourt à la cerise'). The yogurt has a thick, creamy consistency with some visible small fruit pieces. The bowl is not fully filled and appears to contain about a medium portion. Considering the size of the bowl relative to the nearby table surface and paper, a typical serving size for yogurt in such a bowl is usually around 150 to 200 grams. The amount here seems on the smaller to medium side of a typical serving and not overflowing. Therefore, a plausible weight range is between 140 grams and 180 grams, and choosing a value towards the mid-range, I estimate the portion to be about 160 grams. This estimate is consistent with typical yogurt servings and the visual fullness of the bowl."

The sauce oignons is visually identifiable as the reddish-brown onion sauce spread underneath and around the slice of roast meat at the bottom left of the plate. It appears moderately thick, with visible slices of cooked onions. The sauce covers a small portion of the plate around the meat and has some pooling under the other food items, indicating a wet consistency. Given the visible quantity—enough to coat the meat slice and a bit spread on the plate—this portion looks like a light to medium serving of sauce, typically denser than water but not heavy in volume. Considering common Swiss servings of sauce and the plate size reference, I estimate the sauce weight to be between 30 and 50 grams. Choosing a final value in the mid-range, I estimate approximately 40 grams of sauce oignons."

The image shows a plate with a serving of spaghetti topped with a meat sauce and grated cheese. The spaghetti portion looks moderate in size, spread out with some visible strands, but not piled very high. Spaghetti is relatively dense but can appear voluminous because of its shape. Estimating the spaghetti alone, without sauce or cheese, the portion is roughly about one medium serving typically found in Swiss home meals. Given the plate size and the visual volume, the spaghetti portion weight would likely range between 120 and 160 grams. Given the spread and visible tangle, I estimate the spaghetti weight to be about 140 grams, which fits a moderate portion size and is consistent with the scale compared to the spoon and other objects in the background."

The plate shows scrambled egg, chopped tomatoes, avocado pieces, and two folded wraps. The scrambled egg portion appears to be from approximately one medium egg, broken into small curds, spread over a small section of the plate. A typical medium egg weighs about 50 grams before cooking. Cooking causes slight moisture loss but not significant weight reduction. The scrambled egg here looks like a modest single serving roughly equivalent to one whole cooked egg. Thus, the plausible weight range is about 40-55 grams. Given the moderate volume and spread on the plate, I estimate the scrambled egg portion to weigh approximately 48 grams."

The image shows a bowl with a serving of cooked quinoa, asparagus, and a piece of salmon. The quinoa occupies roughly half the bowl in volume, with individual grains visible and a fluffy texture. Given the bowl size and the volume of quinoa, it appears to be a typical cooked portion. Cooked quinoa weighs approximately 160–190 grams per cup (about 185 grams). Here, the quinoa looks like about one cup of cooked quinoa or slightly less, but the bowl is relatively full with some quinoa clinging to the sides, suggesting a volume close to 150-170 grams. Considering density and the visible portion size, I estimate the weight of the quinoa to be about 160 grams."

Given the size of the kernels relative to the plate and the fork, the corn portion covers a small area and is not very deep, suggesting a modest volume. Corn kernels are dense but lightweight, and this amount appears smaller than a standard 100g serving. I estimate the corn weighs between 40 and 60 grams. Considering the visible size and typical density of cooked corn, a final estimate of approximately 50 grams is reasonable."

The purée de cacahuète (peanut butter) is seen as a small dollop on the plate, spread somewhat but clearly limited in quantity. Given the size of the plate and the relative portions of other foods (half a banana and chocolate chips), the peanut butter portion looks typical of a small spoonful. A typical spoonful or dollop of smooth peanut butter weighs around 15-20 grams. The portion here is modest and does not cover a large area or have great thickness, so a reasonable weight range would be approximately 15-25 grams. Considering the visual volume and density of peanut butter, I estimate this purée de cacahuète to be around 20 grams."

Considering the banana's average size and density, I estimate the weight range between 60 and 75 grams. Choosing a mid-point close to 68 grams fits well with the visible portion size and typical banana weight."

The image shows two slices of toasted bread ('pain toast') on a plate, each with visible spread of butter ('beurre'). The butter is spread unevenly but clearly covers most of each slice's surface with some patches thicker than others. Given that a normal thin to medium spread of butter on one slice of bread typically weighs about 5 to 8 grams, and considering some areas have a thicker layer, the butter on each slice likely weighs between 6 and 10 grams. Since there are two slices with butter, the total butter amount looks to be about medium, probably around 7 grams per slice, totaling approximately 14 grams. However, as the question asks only for the estimated weight of butter (without specifying whether it is total or per slice), I will consider the total visible butter to be about 14 grams."

Each blueberry typically weighs between 1 to 2 grams, with 1.5 grams as a reasonable average for fresh blueberries in Switzerland. Considering the total volume and density of the visible blueberries, a plausible weight range would be 12 to 18 grams. Given the pile and visible quantity, I estimate the total weight of the myrtilles to be approximately 15 grams. This estimate aligns well with the relative portion sizes of other items in the bowl such as the raspberries and the porridge."

The beurre is visible as a layer beneath the other toppings and some areas where the bread texture changes. Given the size of the bread slices, which look like typical small baguette pieces around 5-6 cm in diameter and about 2 cm thick, the butter spread appears to be thin but covers most of the slice surfaces. A common thin butter spread on such bread pieces weighs approximately 5-8 grams per slice. Since beurre is spread on both slices, but the focus is on the total beurre amount visible, I estimate around 6 grams per slice, totaling about 12 grams. However, since the question concerns only 'beurre' as a single food item, and the slices are separate but displayed together, I interpret this as the combined weight of butter present on both slices. Therefore, I estimate the total beurre weight as approximately 12 grams, with a plausible range from 10 to 14 grams to allow for minor spreading differences."

The volume looks moderate but not full — it seems like a partial serving rather than a full container. Considering typical density of yogurt (~1 g per ml) and estimating the volume as roughly 100-150 ml depending on thickness and area coverage inside the bowl, a realistic weight range is 100-150 grams.

The balsamic cream is visible primarily as a thin drizzle on the ham surface, covering a small area and appearing glossy but not pooled. Considering its liquid, syrupy form and typical portion sizes for drizzle used as condiment, the weight is quite small. A thin layer of balsamic cream, as seen here, usually weighs between 5 to 15 grams. Given the moderate but not excessive amount, a reasonable estimate would be near the middle of this range.

The portion covers a small area approximately the size of about half a standard hand palm. Given the size and typical water content/density of roasted peppers, these pieces likely weigh less than their apparent volume suggests. Typical weight for a medium raw red bell pepper is around 150-160 grams, but here only about one third to half of such a pepper is present and after roasting the weight reduces due to water loss. Estimating that the visible portion corresponds roughly to about 60-80 grams of fresh weight, and considering shrinkage, I propose a weight range of 40-60 grams for the roasted peppers on the plate.

Given the standard density of butter and its typical portion sizes, this looks like a modest pat of butter usually served as a single serving. Such a piece is likely around 10-15 grams. Considering the thickness and slight irregularity but compact volume, I estimate the butter weight to be about 12 grams."

The image shows a white rectangular plate with several food items arranged separately. The poivron (red bell pepper) is cut into strips and lightly cooked or roasted, placed toward the bottom center of the plate. The quantity is moderate, consisting of a small pile of pepper strips roughly covering a small area of the plate. Considering that cooked bell pepper softens and shrinks, the visible volume likely represents a bit more in original raw weight. A typical raw red pepper weighs about 150-180 grams, but here it is a fraction of a whole pepper. The poivron portion visually corresponds approximately to one quarter to one third of a medium-sized bell pepper. Given its density and that cooked peppers lose some water but remain dense, the plausible weight range is about 40-60 grams. I estimate the poivron weight at 50 grams, which aligns well with the size and volume relative to the other items (such as the pieces of chicken and sliced tomato) on the plate."

The image shows two sandwiches on a plate, each containing a piece of cooked chicken breast, some green lettuce, and a visible spread of curry-flavored mayonnaise. The target food item is 'sauce curry avec mayonnaise'. The mayonnaise sauce is spread thinly but evenly inside both sandwiches, visible by its yellowish color along the bread and on some lettuce. Considering typical sandwich condiment usage, and the visible amount, it's likely around 10-15 grams of sauce per sandwich. Since there are two sandwiches and the question is for the weight in grams of this sauce, assuming the estimation is for the total visible amount, the total sauce weighs approximately 20-30 grams. Given the sauce is not heavily piled or dripping but moderately spread, I'll estimate it at the mid-point of this range, about 25 grams. This is consistent with typical condiment portions in european-style sandwiches of this size, and visually plausible given the thin, even layer visible."

The salade verte is located on the left side of the plate, consisting mainly of leafy greens with some visible texture and volume. There is also a layer of mixed seeds scattered on top. The portion of salad green covers a moderate area of the plate but appears loose and not densely packed, which fits the expected low density of leafy greens. Given the plate is medium-sized, and considering Swiss portion sizes tend to be modest, the salad appears to be a small to medium serving, roughly corresponding to about one handful of leaves. Taking into account the volume and adding slight weight for the seeds embedded on top, a plausible weight range would be between 20 and 35 grams. I estimate the salade verte to weigh approximately 28 grams, which fits visually with a fresh, loosely arranged salad on this plate."

The image shows a white plate with a portion of white asparagus spears accompanied by a dollop of mayonnaise Thomy. The mayonnaise portion appears to be about a tablespoon in size, which is a typical serving for a dipping sauce. Given the creamy and dense texture of mayonnaise, and visual comparison to the asparagus, the amount is not very large but significant enough to be noticeable. A tablespoon of mayonnaise generally weighs about 14-15 grams. Considering the visual appearance and typical serving size for dipping sauces, I estimate the mayonnaise Thomy portion to be approximately 15 grams."

The peanut purée (purée cacahuète) is visible on the plate as a small dollop next to the oatmeal and banana. It has a smooth and creamy texture and occupies a small area on the plate, roughly about the size of a large spoonful. Given the density of peanut butter, a spoonful typically weighs around 15 to 20 grams. The portion here is medium-small, not heaped but a noticeable dollop. Therefore, the plausible weight range is about 12 to 20 grams. Considering the visible size and comparison to the banana half and chocolate chips, a good estimate is near the midpoint, around 16 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread on a white plate. One slice is spread with butter and molasses, and the other slice with butter and jam. The target food item is 'beurre' (butter). The butter appears to be spread thinly but fairly evenly across both slices, covering less than half the surface of each slice with a visible thin layer. Each bread slice seems like a typical portion from a small loaf of artisanal bread, around 50 grams each. Butter is dense, and a thin layer on bread typically weighs around 5-10 grams depending on thickness and coverage. Given the visible coverage and thickness of the butter on both slices, and that the butter is partially covered by the other toppings, I estimate the total butter present to be in the range of 7 to 12 grams. Considering a modest spread, I choose an estimate near the middle of this range. Therefore, the estimated weight of beurre is approximately 9 grams."

The image shows a handful of cashew nuts (noix de cajou) held in an adult's hand, allowing a good size reference. There are approximately 20 cashew nuts visible. A single cashew nut typically weighs about 1.2 grams. Multiplying by the number of nuts gives an estimated range of about 22 to 26 grams depending on the exact nut sizes. Considering slight variation in size and compactness, the total weight of the cashew nuts in the hand is most plausibly around 24 grams."

The salade consists of fresh green lettuce leaves with some dressing visible on top. The portion occupies about one-third of the plate, composed mainly of large, loosely arranged leaves. Lettuce is very low density, so even a visually large portion weighs less than it looks. Given the size of the plate and the portion of lettuce relative to the skewers of meats, the lettuce likely weighs between 40 to 70 grams. Considering the leaves are fresh and loosely packed, I estimate the total weight of the salade to be about 55 grams."

The image shows a single whole peach ('pêche') placed on a white surface. The peach appears to be of medium size, roughly the size of a small to medium fist. Typically, a medium peach weighs between 130 and 170 grams. Given this peach's visible size and density, it does not appear unusually small or large, so a reasonable weight estimate would be around the midpoint of that range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the peach to be approximately 150 grams."

The image shows two small pieces of grilled chicken on a plate, with charred orange bell peppers and a small piece of corn visible as well. Each piece of chicken looks roughly cubical and about 3-4 cm in size, with some visible seasoning. Given the density of cooked chicken breast, pieces this size typically weigh between 30 and 40 grams each. Since there are two pieces, the total weight of the chicken on the plate is likely between 60 and 80 grams. The portion is small to medium and does not appear especially thick or heavy. Considering these factors, I estimate the total weight of the chicken to be about 70 grams."

The image shows a plate with two fried eggs ('œufs au plat'), some steamed broccoli, and a portion of semolina ('semoule'). The target food item, œufs au plat, consists of two sunny-side-up eggs. Each standard large egg in France/Switzerland weighs about 50 grams in shell; the edible portion without shell is around 43-45 grams. Fried eggs lose some water during cooking but mostly retain their weight. The two eggs are fully cooked and appear medium size with the yolks mostly intact. The seasoning on top doesn't add weight. Thus, two eggs would sum approximately to 90 grams (45g each). Considering slight water loss from frying (approximately 5% loss), a safe full range would be 85-95 grams. Given the plate's context and the visible size of the eggs compared to broccoli florets and couscous, an estimate of 90 grams total is reasonable and balanced."

The image shows a small bowl filled with crunchy clusters of muesli next to a square dish containing plain yogurt. The muesli is quite voluminous but consists of light oat clusters, which typically weigh less than they appear. The bowl is a standard small serving size, roughly 8-10 cm in diameter, and appears filled to the brim with muesli. Given that such a bowl usually holds about 40-60 grams of dry muesli, and considering this portion looks full and dense with larger clusters, I estimate the weight of the muesli to be in the range of 50-65 grams. Balancing the visual volume and known weights of muesli servings in Switzerland, a medium portion here seems to be around 58 grams."

The yogourt nature appears as a creamy white spread on a slice of pain complet (whole grain bread). The layer is moderately thick and covers nearly the entire surface of the bread slice. Given the average size of a piece of pain complet, which is likely around 80-90 grams, and considering that the yogourt is spread but not thick like a yogurt cup, a typical portion of yogurt spread on bread would be about 30-50 grams. Visually, the yogurt layer looks medium in thickness, not minimal nor overly thick. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the yogourt nature to be around 40 grams, with a plausible range of 30-50 grams. Considering the visual thickness and spread, 40 grams is a balanced estimate."

The image shows a glass container filled with a mixed dish containing couscous, cucumber pieces, tuna flakes, and visible pumpkin seeds (graines de courge) scattered throughout. The pumpkin seeds appear relatively sparse compared to the bulk of the couscous and cucumber. Pumpkin seeds are small, dense, and typically weigh about 1 gram per tablespoon (~10 grams per 100 ml volume). Visually, the pumpkin seeds cover a small fraction approximately equivalent to about 2 tablespoons spread into the dish. Given the size and depth of the container (which looks to hold roughly 600 ml total), and the visible concentration of pumpkin seeds, the total weight of the pumpkin seeds is likely in the range of 15-25 grams. Given the moderate amount visible and accounting for some possibly hidden beneath the surface, I estimate the weight of the pumpkin seeds (graines de courge) here to be around 20 grams."

The volume is relatively small, roughly equivalent to a few spoonfuls, occupying the base of the bowl with a shallow depth. Considering the typical density of a crème caramel (similar to a thick custard), such a visible portion corresponds to about 100 to 130 grams. The bowl size and the person's fingers give a good perceptual reference. Given the portion appears to be moderate but not full to the brim and slightly unevenly spread, a safe estimate is around 120 grams. This fits well within the plausible range, not too small or overly large for a dessert portion of this type."

Visually, there are two full eggs placed on the pasta. Each fried egg typically weighs around 50 grams (including both white and yolk), but fried eggs lose some water during cooking, so the weight might be slightly less than raw eggs. Given the eggs look fully cooked but not overly large, I estimate each fried egg to weigh about 45-50 grams. For two eggs, the combined weight range is approximately 90-100 grams. Considering the size and visual thickness of the eggs, I will select 95 grams as the estimated weight of the 'oeufs' on the plate."

The image shows a white bowl with fresh spinach leaves, seed sprouts, cherry tomatoes, and falafels. The cherry tomatoes ('tomates cerises') are cut in halves and scattered throughout the bowl. I count about 9 halves or near-whole pieces, which corresponds roughly to 5 whole cherry tomatoes considering halves and some pieces. Each cherry tomato typically weighs around 15-20 grams. Given their size and the number of pieces visible, the total weight of the cherry tomatoes would be in the range of approximately 75 to 100 grams. The tomatoes appear fresh and firm, so typical density applies. Considering this is a medium portion, I estimate around 85 grams as a reasonable final value. This estimate is consistent with the portion size compared to the falafels and spinach leaves visible in the bowl."

Each vegetable meatball looks roughly 3-4 cm in diameter, typical for homemade or store-bought vegetable meatballs. Vegetable meatballs usually weigh less than meat ones due to their lighter ingredients but still have some density from vegetables and binding agents. A reasonable average weight per vegetable meatball is about 30-40 grams. Multiplying by 9 gives an estimated total range of 270-360 grams. Considering the meatballs cover the pasta fairly densely and appear well-formed, I will pick a value slightly in the middle-upper part of the range to account for some density and sauce. Thus, the estimated weight of the boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate is 320 grams."

The graines de chia are visible as scattered small black seeds throughout the mixture. Visually, the amount of chia seeds appears to be a modest sprinkling across the whole volume. Given the density and small individual size of chia seeds, and estimating the total distribution and thickness in the bowl, the chia seeds likely represent about 10-15 grams in weight. This estimation aligns with typical consumption amounts for chia seeds in such a bowl as a topping or mix-in, rather than a large bulk.

The image shows a single croissant au chocolat held in a hand, providing a good size reference. The croissant appears to be a fresh bakery item with a slightly irregular shape, topped with some crunchy bits (likely nuts). The size is medium, typical for a Swiss bakery chocolate croissant, roughly the size of the palm. Chocolate croissants typically weigh between 60 to 90 grams depending on size and filling. Considering the visible size, the thickness, and the bite taken at the bottom, the croissant looks closer to a medium-sized portion. The surface texture and density also indicate a typical buttery, flaky pastry with chocolate filling inside. I estimate a plausible weight range of 70 to 85 grams, choosing a mid-value due to the visible intact portion and typical bakery size. Therefore, I estimate the weight of this croissant au chocolat to be around 78 grams."

The image shows a white square plate with four large raviolis stuffed with pumpkin ('raviolis a la courge'), topped with some black pepper or seasoning. Each ravioli appears to be roughly 6-7 cm in size. Typical fresh filled raviolis of this size generally weigh about 30-40 grams each, considering the thin pasta and filling density. With four raviolis on the plate, the total weight should be approximately between 120 grams (4 x 30g) to 160 grams (4 x 40g). Given their appearance, they look like a medium portion, not overly thick or thin, so I choose a value in the middle of this range. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the 'raviolis a la courge' to be about 140 grams."

The 'oeufs au plat' (fried eggs) are clearly visible in the bowl as two sunny-side-up eggs with intact yolks and some chopped ciboulette sprinkled on top. Their size is typical of standard chicken eggs, and the eggs cover about one-third of the bowl's surface area. Given that one large fried egg usually weighs around 46-50 grams, and considering these are standard size and fully cooked with some moisture loss, the two eggs together likely weigh in the range of 85-100 grams. The eggs appear to be a medium-sized portion (not overly thin or broken), so I estimate the total weight of the 'oeufs au plat' here to be about 90 grams."

The food item to estimate is 'beurre' (butter), which is spread on a triangular slice of bread on the top half of the plate. The butter appears to be thinly spread, with some areas more covered than others, and a partial small amount at the edges. Typical butter spread on bread for a breakfast portion ranges from 5 to 15 grams depending on thickness and spread area. The slice of bread is about a medium size piece of bread (roughly 20 cm² surface). Given the visible thin spread, I estimate that the butter weighs between 8 and 12 grams. Considering the spread is not very thick but covers a good part of the slice, a final estimate around 10 grams is reasonable and plausible in this context."

The image shows a standard size plate with several distinct food items arranged separately. The 'oeuf au plat' (fried egg) is located at the bottom left of the plate. It looks like a single large egg fried sunny side up, with a cooked white spread out irregularly and an intact yolk in the center. A typical large fried egg weighs approximately 45-50 grams. Given the visible size relative to cherry tomatoes and the chunk of feta, this oeuf au plat looks like a standard large egg with no visible modifications or missing parts. Therefore, the plausible weight range is about 43-53 grams. Considering the thickness and typical water loss during frying, a final estimate of 48 grams is reasonable and consistent with the visual evidence and standard Swiss portion sizes."

The target food item is 'tomates,' which are visible as chopped pieces at the bottom part of the cutting board. The tomatoes are freshly cut and moderately coarse in size, covering a surface of around 10x7 cm with a layer depth that suggests roughly one layer of chopped tomato. Given the size and average density of tomatoes (about 0.95 g/cm3) and the visible volume, the portion looks like a medium amount used for one or two servings. Considering the tomatoes' volume and typical chopping size, an estimated weight range would be between 90 and 130 grams. I choose a final value of approximately 110 grams, which aligns with the visible quantity and typical Swiss portion sizes."

The two slices with honey clearly have a thin but visible layer of butter beneath or mixed with the honey. The piece with raspberry jam also has some visible butter spread underneath. Each slice is a standard size of a French or Swiss bread roll sliced in half. Typically, a thin spread of butter on one bread slice is around 5-7 grams. Given the visible coverage and thickness of the butter spread across all three pieces combined, the total butter weight is likely between 10 to 15 grams. Since the prompt asks for the weight of 'beurre' (butter) overall, I estimate approximately 12 grams as a balanced value within this range for all visible butter combined on the three pieces."

The image shows a metal bowl containing mostly muesli with some yaourt nature (natural yogurt) partially visible underneath and mixed in. The muesli is dry, consisting of oats and cereal clusters, and visually occupies about three-quarters of the bowl's volume from a top perspective. The bowl appears medium-sized (approximately 12-15 cm diameter), and the muesli layer is roughly 2-3 cm thick. Considering the density of dry muesli (~0.3-0.4 g/cm3) and its visual volume, this portion typically weighs less than it seems due to air spaces. Estimating the volume of muesli as around 140-180 ml, the total weight estimate ranges roughly 45-70 grams, with the likely value around 55 grams. This is consistent with typical Swiss portion sizes for muesli added to yogurt bowls."

The image shows two slices of toasted bread on a plate, each spread with butter and a thin layer of melasse (molasses). The melasse is spread lightly and evenly across the top of the slice at the bottom of the plate. Considering that the melasse layer is thin and evenly spread, its weight is relatively small compared to the bread and butter. Molasses is dense but the volume here is small, roughly about the size of the slice surface with a light coat, likely around 5-8 grams in total. Given that this is a typical serving with a light spread and not a thick layer, I estimate the weight of melasse on this slice to be approximately 7 grams."

The image shows a small, broken piece of chocolate shaped like a hollow rabbit ('lapin au chocolat'). It is a typical hollow chocolate figure, but only a fragment remains, roughly the size of a large walnut or small fist. Solid hollow chocolate rabbits usually weigh between 100-200 grams, but this is clearly a small broken piece, not the whole object. Given its volume and thickness, I estimate this fragment weighs around 20-30 grams. Considering the density of milk chocolate and the hollow nature, a value near 25 grams fits the visible piece size. The plausible range based on thickness and area visible is 20-30 grams, so the final estimate is 25 grams."

The rice portion, which is white and visible primarily underneath the curry, appears to fill roughly half of a medium-sized bowl. Considering the relative volume of rice compared to the curry and the typical density of cooked white rice, the visible amount is moderate. A medium bowl portion of cooked rice usually weighs between 130-180 grams. Given that the rice does not fill the entire bowl and considering a modest serving amount, the plausible weight range of the rice is around 120 to 160 grams. Choosing a midpoint estimate based on observed fullness, I estimate the rice to weigh approximately 140 grams."

The stack contains 5 visible crackers, and all seem intact and uniform in size without broken pieces. Therefore, the total weight can be estimated by multiplying the approximate weight of each cracker by the number of crackers. Considering slight variation in thickness and seeds density, a single cracker can be estimated around 7.5 grams, so 5 crackers weigh about 37-40 grams in total. After considering visual thickness and typical density, a precise estimate would be 38 grams for this portion."

The apricot jam on the slice appears as a thin, uneven translucent layer with some slight pooling in the middle. Considering the typical density and thickness of apricot jam when spread thinly on toast, it is likely around 5-7 grams per slice. Since only one slice has apricot jam and it is modestly spread, the total weight of apricot jam on that slice is about 6 grams, in the range of 5-7 grams. This estimate reflects the thin layer visible and the area covered which does not fully cover the entire slice but is spread moderately."

The green lettuce leaves are loosely packed at the bottom and around the sides of the bowl. Given that green lettuce is very light and airy, even a moderate volume weighs relatively little. The bowl seems to be roughly 12-14 cm in diameter, with the salad filling about half to two-thirds of the height, suggesting a modest portion size. Considering typical weights for fresh leaf lettuce used in salads and the visible amount here, the salade verte itself likely weighs between 15 and 30 grams. Given the visible volume, the density, and the presence of other ingredients that reduce the relative volume for the lettuce, a final estimate of around 22 grams seems accurate and reasonable."

The ketchup portion is a single neat puddle on the plate, roughly circular with a diameter about 3-4 cm. Given typical condiment serving sizes in Switzerland, a tablespoon of ketchup is about 15 grams, but this puddle looks slightly smaller than a tablespoon, likely around 10-12 grams. Considering the density and common serving sizes of ketchup on plates of this type, a reasonable weight estimate for the ketchup on the plate is about 12 grams, with a plausible range of 10 to 14 grams based on volume and spread.

The chocolate spread covers portions of the waffle in thin to moderate layers, which would add some additional weight but not very much as it is thinly spread and slightly uneven. Based on typical densities, the amount of chocolate spread on this waffle appears to be around 10-15 grams. Since the target food item is 'pâte à tartiner au chocolat' alone, the weight estimate should focus solely on the chocolate spread portion. Given the visible spread and typical density, the weight of the chocolate spread here likely falls between 12 to 18 grams. I estimate it closer to the middle of this range, approximately 15 grams."

The mustard itself is not directly visible as a separate heap or spread, but it is likely spread thinly inside the sandwich. Given that mustard is typically measured in grams for condiment use, and a standard spread on a sandwich is usually about 5 to 15 grams depending on the thickness of application. Because the sandwich looks modest in size and there is no visible excess mustard, I estimate the mustard quantity to be on the lower side of a typical condiment portion, around 7 grams. This estimate accounts for a thin to moderate layer inside the pita, consistent with the sandwich proportions."

Considering the typical density and thickness of galette wraps made from buckwheat or wheat flour, these usually weigh between 60 and 70 grams for a whole wrap of this size. There are no visible signs of additional thickness or extra layering, so a standard weight near this range is appropriate."
xjvrtk,graines de lin,10.0,10,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/ce668b40-a61f-4ac1-abfd-a150071ddd76,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate of tomate salad cut into wedges, seasoned with vinaigre balsamique and topped with graines de lin (flaxseeds). The flaxseeds are scattered over the surface in a moderate layer, covering the tomato pieces quite evenly but not in a thick pile. Given the size of flaxseeds, which are very small and light, and estimating the amount spread to cover the entire plate surface lightly, the total weight of graines de lin appears to be small. Considering the plate size (standard dinner plate), the flaxseeds are likely no more than 1 to 2 tablespoons in volume, which translates roughly to a weight range of about 7 to 14 grams. Given the visual density and distribution, I estimate the weight at about 10 grams. This is plausible relative to the tomato salad portion and typical flaxseed serving sizes used as garnish."
