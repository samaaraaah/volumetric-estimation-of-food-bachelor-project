p96w4a,délice tomate mozzarella,54.0,360,306.0,1.8696537678207739,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/5ebafbd6-315d-44a6-8508-ba143d23adb2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate with a 'délice tomate mozzarella' composed of alternating slices of tomato and mozzarella, arranged in a linear stack. There are 7 visible slices of tomato, each slice approximately 5-6 cm wide and about 0.8-1 cm thick. Between these tomato slices, there are 6 visible slices of mozzarella cheese, slightly thinner, around 0.7 cm thick. The total length of the stack is about 20 cm. The tomato slices are fresh and juicy, with moderate density, while the mozzarella is dense and creamy, contributing significantly to the weight. There also appears to be some balsamic vinegar drizzled on top and some herbs, but these contribute negligible weight. To estimate weight: average tomato slice weighs roughly 30 grams (based on size and density), so 7 slices equal about 210 grams. Mozzarella slices, being denser and thicker, likely weigh around 25 grams each, so 6 slices equal about 150 grams. Summing gives approximately 360 grams for the full portion of tomate mozzarella. Minor adjustments account for overlap and moisture. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the délice tomate mozzarella at approximately 360 grams."
wrah5h,fondant au chocolat maison,73.0,375,302.0,2.4944557592215433,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1be13f84-6a0b-4b1c-bff5-fc0a0fcf87b8,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single slice of fondant au chocolat maison placed on a square white plate. The slice is triangular, with a base of roughly 9-10 cm and a length of about 15 cm, estimated by comparing it to the average size of a coffee cup handle visible in the background. The thickness of the slice looks about 3.5 to 4 cm based on the visible side profile and the overall volume. The texture is dense yet slightly crumbly on the top with a moist, fudgy interior which is typical of a chocolate fondant. Considering the density of the chocolate cake which is high due to butter and chocolate content, the volume approximates a dense mass. Estimating the volume roughly as a wedge (triangular prism), with base ~9.5 cm, height ~15 cm, and thickness ~3.8 cm, gives a volume around 540 cm3. Given that dense chocolate cakes have a density close to 0.85-0.95 g/cm3, using an average of 0.9 g/cm3, the weight of the slice calculates to approximately 486 grams. This seems large for a single slice, so applying more conservative estimation—perhaps the slice is thinner, or the effective density less than expected. Reducing thickness to ~3 cm and density to 0.85 g/cm3 gives approx. 380 grams, which is a reasonable weight for this size and type of rich chocolate cake. Therefore, weighing all visual evidence and density considerations, I estimate the fondant au chocolat maison slice to be approximately 375 grams."
xjvrtk,ananas,200.0,420,220.0,4.978501923512106,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/b41068f9-5a0e-4c11-bf1b-7389d3917889,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a blue plate containing 12 pieces of sliced pineapple (ananas). Each piece is triangular in shape with a thickness of roughly 1.5 to 2 cm, and the pieces range in size but visually average about 4 to 5 cm in length and 3 to 4 cm in width. The texture and moisture content typical of fresh pineapple suggest a medium density. The pieces are not stacked, so no hidden volume is present. Comparing the size of the pineapple pieces against the plate diameter, which looks to be a standard dinner plate of approximately 25 cm diameter, these pieces are moderately sized. Each pineapple piece of this dimension typically weighs between 30 to 40 grams given its density and water content. Multiplying by 12 pieces, the total weight estimate is about 360 to 480 grams. To be conservative and visually precise, I estimate the total weight of ananas as approximately 420 grams."
xjvrtk,courgette et oignons,300.0,120,180.0,6.109979633401222,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/8fb08d9a-4e44-4251-a0e4-26441252d211,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'courgette et oignons' which is located in the left half of the glass container. Visually, the courgette (zucchini) is sliced into small chunks, mixed with translucent slices of onions. The portion fills about half of the container's volume on the left side. The container appears to be approximately 15 cm wide, so the food depth is roughly 3-4 cm, based on standard glass container proportions. The vegetable chunks are relatively dense and cooked but not heavily compacted. Considering the mix is fairly moist with visible cooking juice and limited air space, I estimate the volume of courgette et oignons to be around 150 cubic cm. Given the density of cooked courgette and onions (about 0.8 g/cm3), the total weight is approximately 120 grams. This is a conservative estimate taking into account the mixture and moisture level visible in the image."
p96w4a,purée de pdt,214.0,40,174.0,4.21317040054311,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/828972fc-fa12-4270-a960-fc59367fc91e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'purée de pdt' (mashed potatoes) on the plate. Visually, the mashed potatoes form a roughly rectangular mound about 7 cm by 5 cm in area, with a thickness estimated at around 1.5 cm. Comparing the mashed potatoes to the size of the meat pieces and carrots nearby, and considering the plate diameter of a standard dinner plate (about 26 cm), this seems reasonable. The mashed potatoes have a dense but slightly fluffy texture, typical of cooked pureed potatoes. No other foods are mixed into the purée as visible from the surface. There is sauce over the purée, but container weight is excluded, so only solid mashed potato volume matters. Calculating approximate volume: 7cm * 5cm * 1.5cm = 52.5 cm3. Mashed potatoes have a density roughly 0.7 to 0.8 g/cm3 (less dense than water due to aeration). Taking 0.75 g/cm3 as a mid value, the estimated weight is 52.5 * 0.75 = about 39 grams. Considering some uncertainty in thickness and slight overestimation of area, I conservatively estimate the mashed potatoes portion to be approximately 40 grams."
xjvrtk,tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe,250.0,80,170.0,4.808780267028739,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/f607625b-a07d-423e-a564-4d96ebadf084,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification - The target food, 'tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe,' is a single square slice of flat tart placed on a round plate. The tart surface has a visible topping of diced rhubarb pieces mixed with apple and a creamy base with some cinnamon sprinkled on top. The piece is intact and clearly displayed, with no portions hidden. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The tart slice covers a significant part of a standard dessert or small dinner plate. Typically, such plates have a diameter of about 22 cm. The slice seems to be about one quarter of a typical tarte flambée round shape; it is approximately 13 cm wide and 13 cm long. The thickness of the tart appears thin, typical for tarte flambée, around 0.8 to 1 cm, including the pâte and topping. Step 3: Density Considerations - The tart dough base is thin and relatively light. The topping includes diced rhubarb and apple pieces which are dense but cut into small chunks scattered sparsely but covering the tart surface, plus a layer of crème fraîche or cream, which adds some weight but is not thick. The cooking does not appear to have dehydrated the topping substantially, so the density is moderate. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Considering the standard weight of a whole tarte flambée (roughly 300-350g depending on toppings), and that this is a quarter portion, the estimate would range roughly 75 to 90 grams. Visual cues suggest slightly less weight due to the thinness and mostly vegetable topping, so leaning toward the lower end of this range. Step 5: Cross-validation - The tart slice presents no extra dense layers or thick dough. The apple-rhubarb chunks are lightly cooked and not overly moist or heavy. The slice is consistent with a weight around 80 grams given size and thickness without overestimation. Therefore, the estimated weight of the tarte flambée pomme rhubarbe slice is about 80 grams."
2ahgvr,porridge salé,48.0,180,132.0,0.7169042769857433,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/a35f3211-3b33-4826-97b8-3af69655dada,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small glass jar with a metal lid containing savory porridge ('porridge salé'). The jar diameter is approximately 7 cm based on the lid's visible markings 'Ø 70 mm'. The porridge fills about 70% of the jar's volume, measured from the bottom to just below the neck of the jar. The jar appears to be cylindrical with a height of approximately 7-8 cm filled with porridge. Assuming a height of porridge around 5 cm inside the jar and a diameter of 7 cm, the volume can be roughly estimated using the formula for a cylinder: V = π × r² × h = 3.14 × (3.5 cm)² × 5 cm ≈ 192 cm³. Porridge density is close to water (around 1 g/cm³) given its thick but moist consistency, so the weight of porridge inside the jar is approximately 190 grams. Considering the slight air pockets and the texture not being fully compact, a small reduction is reasonable. Therefore, the weight of the porridge salé is estimated at about 180 grams."
2ahgvr,brochette de boeuf,76.0,195,119.0,1.0233084408237159,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/5b8a0853-ecc4-4015-bc9a-2b50766f873a,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single brochette de boeuf (beef skewer) placed horizontally on the plate above the bread slice. It has three visible chunks of grilled beef threaded onto a wooden skewer. The chunks appear roughly cubical with some grill marks. They measure approximately 4-5 cm each in length and about 3-4 cm in height and width. Considering the density of cooked beef, which is quite compact and dense, each cube likely weighs around 60-70 grams. With three pieces, the total weight should be in the range of 180 to 210 grams. Given the visual fullness and thickness of the chunks, I estimate the combined weight of the brochette de boeuf to be approximately 195 grams."
p8a2w5,artichaut,143.0,240,97.0,1.5694727313871917,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p8a2w5/dish_media/9b2c7383-a434-4260-ac30-86103e4546ea,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a single whole artichaut placed on a white plate. The artichoke's size can be compared to the hand holding the plate; the thumb visible near the edge helps provide scale. The artichoke is about the size of a large fist, with visible petals that are thick and tightly packed. The artichoke appears to be cooked or steamed, given its slightly darker color and texture, which affects density somewhat, making it denser than when raw. The shape is natural and compact without missing parts. There is some sauce or liquid on the plate but it is separate and should not be included in weight. Based on the size comparison to the hand and plate, the artichoke is roughly 10 cm wide and about 12-14 cm long, with decent thickness. Considering typical density and moisture content of a cooked artichoke of this size, I estimate the weight to be approximately 240 grams."
8japfq,muesli nature,53.0,150,97.0,0.5816926906539941,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/8japfq/dish_media/aec8837c-53fa-470e-b484-737ecb280e65,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a metallic bowl containing a mixture of natural muesli on top and natural yogurt partially visible underneath. The target food item is 'muesli nature'. Visual identification highlights a granular, loose mixture of oats, grains, and small fragmented pieces, which fills roughly 70% of the bowl's visible content on the surface. The bowl appears to be a standard medium-sized metal bowl with an estimated diameter around 15 cm. The depth of visible muesli is about 2 to 3 cm thick from the surface, but since the muesli lies on top of the yogurt, there's no significant hidden layer beyond the visible one. Density consideration for dry muesli is low compared to many dense foods, typically around 0.3 to 0.5 g/cm³. The volume of muesli can be approximated using the surface area (π × radius²) times height: assuming radius ~7.5 cm, surface area ~177 cm² and height ~2.5 cm, volume is approximately 440 cm³. Using a density midpoint of ~0.4 g/cm³ for dry muesli, the estimated weight is approximately 176 grams. However, since the muesli is on yogurt and seems slightly compressed and includes some moisture absorption, a slight downward adjustment is reasonable to around 150 grams. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'muesli nature' portion is 150 grams."
wrah5h,"délice des dieux (biscuit, fruits rouges, séré+mascarpone)",205.0,120,85.0,1.9715999094817833,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/5de398c7-684b-448d-ba0a-f318d009bccd,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows one portion of a dessert called 'délice des dieux,' which includes a biscuit base, red fruits (raspberries and blueberries), and a topping made of séré and mascarpone. The piece is placed on a small plate with a diameter likely around 18-20 cm, which serves as a reference. Visually, the piece is approximately rectangular, measuring roughly 8 cm by 6 cm on the plate. The thickness of the dessert appears to be about 2.5 cm, with a biscuit base of approximately 0.8 cm, a mixed fruit layer soaked into the biscuit, and a thick mascarpone/séré cream layer above. The raspberries and blueberries on top provide a density clue: raspberries average about 4 grams each and blueberries about 1.5 grams each despite size differences. There are two raspberries and two blueberries visible on top. The biscuit base looks moist and slightly dense but not thick, while the creamy mascarpone layer is thick and dense, giving the overall portion a richer weight than volume alone indicates. Estimating volume, 8 cm × 6 cm × 2.5 cm gives 120 cm³, and assuming an average density for this type of dessert between 0.9 and 1.1 g/cm³ due to cream and fruit components, weights range from about 108-132 grams. Adding the weight of the visible berries on top (~11-12g) already integrated into the volume estimate (as they appear sunk into the cream, but included visually). Conservatively adjusting for possible empty air pockets in the cream and fruit juices soaking, I estimate the dessert portion weighs around 120 grams total."
6fwmw2,fraises,146.0,61,85.0,1.404163837972392,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/6fwmw2/dish_media/fc43899a-21ef-45e8-95b0-d10af04f9539,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a small green bowl containing exactly three whole strawberries (fraises) with their stems and leaves intact. The strawberries are not sliced or cut. Observing the bowl's size compared to the wooden surface, the strawberries appear relatively large for their type. One strawberry is noticeably bigger and heart-shaped, approximately 6.5 cm in length, and the other two are slightly smaller but still sizable (around 5 cm each). The strawberries are plump, with visible seeds and a typical firm texture, suggesting they are fresh and dense. Considering typical strawberry density, where a medium strawberry weighs about 12-18 grams, these larger strawberries likely weigh closer to 20-25 grams each given their size. Estimating 25 grams for the largest and about 18 grams each for the smaller two, the total weight sums to about 61 grams. This accounts for their volume, density, and visible fullness, avoiding overestimation by not assuming denser fruit or smaller size. Therefore, the estimated total weight of the fraises in the bowl is approximately 61 grams."
p96w4a,chili,191.0,270,79.0,1.7072867164516858,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/58f82c5a-4b79-4f95-9f8f-0b55a93d8383,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a plate divided into three parts: cooked rotini pasta on the left, a portion of chili with visible chunks of cervelas sausage and kidney beans on the right, and a small dollop of crème fraîche in the center. The target food item to estimate is 'chili'. Visually, the chili portion covers roughly half of the plate's surface on the right side. The chili includes visible cubed cervelas pieces, kidney beans, and a thick tomato-based sauce. Considering the size of the plate (standard dinner plate, approximately 25 cm diameter) and the density of chili, which is a dense mixture of meat, beans, and sauce, the chili portion appears to be a substantial serving. The chili layer is spread with moderate thickness, likely around 2-3 cm considering the volume of cubed cervelas and beans. Based on visual comparison with the pasta and the plate, and accounting for chili being dense, I estimate the chili weight to be approximately between 250 and 300 grams. A conservative estimate aiming to avoid overestimation is about 270 grams."
wrah5h,tiramisu,72.0,150,78.0,0.6354378818737271,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/7b0475df-5b02-4072-abb9-ef75acf0f031,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a black plate with two pieces of dessert. The piece on the left is the tiramisu, which has visible layers of creamy mascarpone and soaked ladyfinger-like sponge cake. The tiramisu piece has an approximate length of 10 cm, width of about 4 cm, and thickness of approximately 3.5 cm, judged by comparing to the nearby forêt noir slice and the plate itself. The creamy layers and soaked sponge give it a somewhat dense yet soft appearance. Considering tiramisu's typical density, I estimate roughly 1.1 g/cm3 for this combination. Calculating volume (10 x 4 x 3.5 = 140 cm3) and multiplying by density gives about 154 grams. Given the creamy texture and some potential for air pockets, a conservative estimate slightly lower than a direct volume-density product is reasonable. Therefore, I estimate the tiramisu slice weight to be about 150 grams."
wrah5h,gaufre à la patate douce,85.0,160,75.0,0.721317040054311,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/1876b0b6-568d-4583-8186-073df252e6c9,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows four pieces of sweet potato waffles ('gaufre à la patate douce') on a patterned plate. Each piece is roughly rectangular with visible depth of about 1.5 cm as assessed from the side profile of the waffles. The width and length of each piece appear to be about 6 cm by 5 cm, based on comparison to the plate diameter and pattern size. The waffles have a dense appearance with a crisp outer texture, typical of sweet potato waffles, indicating moderate density. The pieces are topped with a visible creamy white sauce and a slice of smoked salmon, but since the target is only the waffle, those toppings are excluded. The total waffle portion consists of four pieces, each roughly similar in size. Estimating volume for one piece as 6cm x 5cm x 1.5cm = 45 cubic cm, for four pieces total volume is about 180 cubic cm. Given sweet potato waffles have a density close to 0.9 g/cm3 due to the sweet potato content and cooked batter, the total weight is roughly 180 x 0.9 = 162 grams. This excludes sauce and salmon weight. Therefore, the estimated weight for the 'gaufre à la patate douce' portion shown is approximately 160 grams."
2ahgvr,gyozas végétariens (3 pièces),63.0,135,72.0,0.5132382892057027,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/c9826c1c-42e1-4363-9dcc-cf68d7642c4e,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows exactly three vegetarian gyozas on a square white plate. Each gyoza appears to be uniformly filled with a thin dough wrapper that is visible and slightly translucent, showing some vegetable-based filling inside. The gyozas are fried with some browned edges visible, which adds little to volume but confirms cooking style. Each gyoza is about 7 to 8 cm in length, approximately 3 to 4 cm wide, and appears to have a height/thickness of about 2 to 3 cm considering the filling and dough layers. Comparing size to the plate, which is a standard small serving plate around 20 cm wide, these dimensions make sense. Gyozas are generally dense due to filling of finely chopped vegetables and sometimes tofu, wrapped in dough. Typical single vegetarian gyozas weigh between 40-50 grams depending on thickness and filling density. These particular gyozas do not appear unusually large or dense, so a conservative estimate per piece is about 45 grams. Multiplying by three pieces, the total weight estimate is 135 grams for the three gyozas combined."

The target food item is 'thon' (tuna). The image shows a glass container filled with a mixture of couscous, cucumber pieces, and visible chunks of tuna. The tuna pieces are dispersed throughout and appear as irregularly shaped flakes and small chunks. Visually, I count approximately 12 to 15 distinct tuna pieces visible on top and partially through the side of the container. Some chunks are larger (about 3-4 cm long and roughly 1-1.5 cm thick), some smaller. The tuna pieces are flaky and light in density compared to denser foods but are still substantial pieces rather than just tiny flakes. The container size is about 14 cm by 14 cm with a depth of about 5 cm filled with the mixture. The total volume of food is roughly 1000 ml (1 liter) considering some air space and gaps. Tuna, being dense, typically weighs about 1 g per cm3. Given the tuna pieces occupy approximately 15-20% of the visible mix volume by volume, with some distributed deeper unseen, the weight of tuna could be estimated as 15-20% of roughly 1000 ml by volume = about 150-200 grams maximum. Being conservative due to partial hidden volume and light flakiness, I estimate the tuna weight to be approximately 170 grams."
ppf8hc,poivrons jaune,150.0,80,70.0,1.1880515953835709,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/95e84def-c82b-4360-8390-f5153ff61064,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food is 'poivrons jaune' (yellow peppers). In the image, I see a halved yellow bell pepper that has been cooked and stuffed, plus two additional peeled slices of yellow pepper placed on the plate. The halved pepper section stands upright and is filled with quinoa and bulgur, so the pepper wall thickness is visible mostly around the edges. The slices are curved and appear to be about 1 cm thick from the side profile. Using the diameter of the plate and the visible fork as rough scale references, the pepper half's volume looks moderate, with the pepper flesh slightly softened and shrunk from cooking. Each of the two separate slices is a thinner segment removed from the whole pepper, both roughly equal in size and thickness. Given that yellow peppers are mostly water and have a density close to 0.9 g/cm3, the total visible pepper parts combined correspond roughly to about half a medium-large pepper. A medium yellow pepper usually weighs around 150-180 g in raw form; cooking reduces some weight but does not significantly change it here. Considering the visual evidence, the thickness, and the peeled separated pieces, I estimate the total weight of the yellow peppers present (half pepper plus two slices) to be around 80 grams."

The image shows two slices of bread on a white plate. Each slice is roughly rectangular with rounded edges. The bread appears to be a typical rustic or country style loaf with a firm crust and airy, porous crumb inside. The thickness of each slice is about 2 to 2.5 cm when judging from the visible side profile of the slice in the foreground. The slices appear to be about 10 cm wide and 12 cm long. The bread has a moderate density with visible air holes but a relatively firm structure. Considering these dimensions and density, a single slice of this style of bread typically weighs between 40 and 50 grams. There are two slices visible in the image; since the target food item is ""pain,"" the combined weight is the sum of these two slices. Therefore, I estimate the total weight of the ""pain"" in the image to be approximately 90 grams."

The target food is 'riz' (rice). In the image, the rice occupies roughly half of a medium-sized bowl, with the other half filled with dalh de lentilles corail. The bowl appears to be about 15 cm in diameter and approximately 6-7 cm deep. The rice portion is somewhat fluffy, with visible grains slightly separated but compacted in the bowl, indicating a typical serving of cooked white rice. The depth of the rice is about half the bowl's height because it is level with the dalh, which looks to fill half the bowl depth. Comparing the rice portion with the size of the spoon handle and the bowl, the volume of the rice is moderate, not heaped or scant. Cooked white rice has a density roughly around 0.9 g/cm3. Estimating the rice volume as approximately 250-300 ml (half the bowl volume), this corresponds to about 225-270 grams. Considering the fluffiness and bowl fill level visually, a conservative estimate is 250 grams for the cooked rice portion."

The image shows a partially eaten slice of tarte aux fraises on a standard-sized dessert plate. The slice has a visible layer of cream filling and a generous topping of whole and halved strawberries. There are six distinct strawberry pieces visible on the tart slice. The tart base appears thin and crumbly, and some fragments are broken on the plate. Visually, the strawberry pieces are medium-sized (roughly 3-4 cm in length each). Comparing to the size of the plate and fork in the background, the slice is approximately 10-12 cm in length, 5-6 cm in width, and the thickness (including crust, cream, and strawberries) is about 3-4 cm. Strawberries are fairly dense but light compared to the cream and crust. Estimating density, the strawberries likely weigh around 15-20 grams each given the size and their whole and halved states, so the total strawberry weight on the slice is around 90-110 grams. Focusing only on the strawberries, I estimate their weight to be approximately 100 grams, prioritizing visual cues and conservative volume estimation."
p96w4a,cervelas,130.0,190,60.0,0.8825526137135098,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/58f82c5a-4b79-4f95-9f8f-0b55a93d8383,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a white plate with three distinct sections: cooked fusilli pasta on the left, a chili mixture with visible kidney beans and cubed cervelas sausage on the right, and a small dollop of white crème fraîche in the middle. The target food to estimate is 'cervelas', which appears as cubed pieces mixed within the chili. Step 1: Visual Identification - The cervelas pieces are about 9 visible cubes scattered in the chili mixture. They are irregular but roughly consistent in size. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - Each cervelas cube appears approximately 2.5-3 cm per side (length, width, height). Assuming somewhat dense, compact sausage texture. Step 3: Density Considerations - Cervelas is a cooked sausage, dense and fatty, roughly similar in density to meat products, around 1.0 g/cm3 or slightly higher. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Each cube's approximate volume is about 3x3x3 cm = 27 cm3. Considering some irregularity, a mean volume of 20-25 cm3 is plausible. For 9 cubes, total volume is roughly 180-225 cm3. Accounting for density close to 1 g/cm3, estimated total weight for cervelas cubes is about 180-225 grams. Step 5: Cross-Validation - The chili side of the plate is substantial but not overflowing, and cervelas makes up part of it mixed with beans and sauce. Given the visible proportion of cervelas and its size, a conservative estimate would be near the lower half of the volume range to avoid overestimation. Therefore, I estimate the cervelas weight to be approximately 190 grams."

The image shows one piece of pain aux fruits being held between two fingers, allowing a precise scale reference: the piece is about the size of a large bite, roughly 6 cm by 5 cm in visible surface area. The thickness appears moderate, approximately 2 to 3 cm based on the visible edge near the top right, showing some depth but not overly thick. The bread has a dense texture with visible fruit pieces and nuts embedded, suggesting a moderately dense, hearty baked good rather than light and airy bread. Considering the visible salt and nuts on the surface, the density is increased from normal bread. Typically, such a fruit and nut bread has a density close to 0.5 to 0.6 g/cm³. Estimating volume as 6 cm × 5 cm × 2.5 cm = 75 cm³, and applying density of about 0.55 g/cm³, the approximate weight is 41 grams. Given some variability in density and measurement, a conservative estimate is around 40 grams for this single piece of pain aux fruits."

The image shows a portion of diced tomatoes and cucumber on a plate. The target food is ""tomates."" Specifically, there are about 8 visible chunks of tomato mixed with cucumber pieces. Each tomato piece appears to be roughly 3-4 cm in length with a thickness of about 1.5-2 cm, showing some juiciness and fleshiness typical of fresh tomatoes. The volume of the tomatoes is relatively small compared to the cucumber pieces. Using the plate size as reference, which is likely a standard dinner plate (about 25 cm diameter), the portion of tomatoes occupies a modest area and depth on the plate. Tomato density is moderate, with water content making it lighter per volume compared to dense vegetables. Considering the number of chunks, their size, and typical tomato density, each chunk likely weighs about 12-15 grams. Multiplying by 8 pieces gives an estimated total weight in the range of about 96-120 grams. Conservatively, I estimate the weight of the tomatoes to be approximately 105 grams based solely on visual evidence."

The ratatouille is located at the top right side of the plate. It consists of cooked, chopped vegetables including visible pieces of zucchini, eggplant, and tomato in a saucy mixture. The portion covers roughly one-sixth of the plate's surface area. Visually, the ratatouille has a depth slightly more than the surface, estimating about 2 cm thick based on the volume relative to the bulgur beside it and the egg. The texture looks saucy but dense due to cooked vegetable chunks. Comparing to the bulgur portion (which has an estimated weight around 120-130g given the volume of cooked grains) and considering typical cooked vegetable densities (roughly 0.8 to 1 g/cm³), the ratatouille appears to be approximately 140 grams in weight. This accounts for visual volume, density, and the size of the serving relative to other items on the plate."

The image shows a white bowl with a creamy white yogurt containing visible small pieces of apricot. The yogurt fills approximately one-third to slightly less than half of the bowl's depth, which appears to be a medium-sized ceramic bowl typically around 12-14 cm in diameter. The yogurt surface is smooth with a few visible apricot chunks, indicating mixed fruit pieces inside. Given the density of yogurt (roughly 1 g/ml), and estimating the volume to be roughly 100-130 ml based on the bowl size and fill level, the weight should correlate closely to volume in grams. The apricot pieces add some weight but only minimally. Considering a medium portion of apricot yogurt served in this bowl and based on visual evidence, I estimate the weight of the yogurt to be approximately 120 grams."

The image shows one whole peeled carrot placed on a textured countertop. The carrot is fully visible with no parts hidden. It appears to be around 12-15 cm in length based on the typical scale of countertop textures and the visible shadow that suggests a moderate thickness. The carrot is relatively slender but has natural tapering, with a diameter approximately 2-3 cm near the thicker end. The surface texture and color confirm it is peeled, making it slightly smaller in mass than an unpeeled one of the same size. Carrots have a density close to 0.6 to 0.7 grams per cm³. Estimating the carrot as a cylinder with average diameter of about 2.5 cm and length about 13.5 cm, its volume is roughly π * (1.25)² * 13.5 ≈ 66 cm³. Multiplying volume by density (0.65 g/cm³) yields about 43 grams. Given possible variation in shape and density, a conservative weight estimate for the peeled carrot is around 40-45 grams. Therefore, I estimate the weight of the peeled carrot to be approximately 42 grams."

The image shows a white bowl partially filled with milk and a layer of cereals floating on the surface. The cereals are a granola type mix with some visible clusters and a few small chocolate pieces. The spoon inside the bowl offers a useful size reference; it is a standard teaspoon approximately 13-15 cm long, which suggests the bowl is a medium-sized breakfast bowl (~15 cm diameter). The cereal layer is relatively thin, roughly covering the bottom 30-40% of the bowl’s visible surface area, with depth likely shallow. Considering the uneven granola clusters and the density of both granola and chocolate pieces, the grain mix is moderately dense. Visual thickness of the cereal layer combined with the distribution suggests a volume around 60-70 ml of dry cereal, which corresponds to approximately 25-30 grams dry weight. Given the milk immersion, the visible volume is spread thinly, but since we want the dry cereal weight only, I estimate the cereal weight to be about 28 grams conservatively based on visual evidence and size reference."

The target food is ""fromage de brebis/chèvre (2 bouts)."" On the plate, there are two small pieces of cheese near the bottom left and center of the plate. They appear to be firm cheeses with slight rind, typical of sheep's and goat's cheese. Each piece is roughly 3-4 cm long, 2-3 cm wide, and about 1 cm thick. The smaller pieces have some irregular shapes but appear dense rather than soft or spreadable. Comparing to the slice of baguette (which is about 12-13 cm long), these pieces are visually about one-quarter to one-third the size of that slice. Given the density typical for aged goat/sheep cheeses (which usually range from 1.0 to 1.2 g/cm3), the weight per piece is likely around 30-40 grams. For two pieces combined, the total estimated weight is about 65 grams. This estimate is based solely on visible size, density, and comparison to other items on the plate such as the bread slice and butter pat, avoiding overestimation by carefully assessing the small individual pieces."

The image shows a rectangular white plastic container filled with a diced mixture of Greek salad ingredients: visible pieces include small cubes of cucumber, red and yellow bell pepper, tomatoes, some onion rings, black olives, and small bits of feta cheese. The salad fills roughly half to two-thirds of the container's depth. The container sits on a wooden surface with no clear size reference objects in close proximity except the visible table surface and parts of other containers in the background, which loosely suggests a small to medium-size food storage container about 10 cm wide and 12 cm long based on typical table grain size and container thickness. The diced vegetables appear uniformly cut into approximately 1 cm cubes, and the salad is mixed with some visible salad dressing, which adds minor weight. Given the container is filled about 60% with the chopped salad mixture, the volume corresponds roughly to around 400 to 450 ml of salad. Considering the density of the assorted vegetables and cheese, which tend to be moderately dense and moist, I estimate a density around 0.8 to 0.9 g/ml. Multiplying the estimated volume by density results in an approximate weight range of 320 to 400 grams. To be conservative and prioritize visual evidence over standard portion sizes, I estimate the salad weight at 360 grams."

The target food item is 'mais' (corn). Visually, the corn is presented as a small pile on a white plate, adjacent to chickpeas, broccoli, and salad leaves. The pile of corn covers an area roughly 6 cm by 4 cm on the plate, and the depth appears to be about 1 cm, as it is a loose pile of kernels rather than a layered block. The kernels look cooked and drained, typical for canned or boiled corn, which is dense but lightweight. Considering the volume (approximately 24 cubic centimeters) and the density of cooked corn (~0.7 grams per cubic centimeter), the estimated weight is around 17 grams. This estimation strictly relies on the visual size relative to the plate and the shape and compactness of the corn pile, avoiding any assumptions beyond the visible evidence."
m4egh2,sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon),98.0,140,42.0,0.4657162253903598,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/m4egh2/dish_media/6b91ac4b-1f0f-4176-bf40-a12a6cd892e2,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon)'. Visually, the sauce is mixed fully with the pasta and mushrooms, visible as creamy white coating on the sliced mushrooms and some pasta surfaces. The actual liquid sauce volume is not standing separately but integrated with the pasta and mushrooms. The dominant solid pieces in the sauce are mushroom slices, of which I count about 8 medium-large pieces visible across the dish. These mushrooms are soaked in the creamy sauce, which likely adds additional weight. The sauce volume based on the creamy coating and some pooling at the pasta edges looks to be moderate, roughly covering the components without excess pooling. The bowl size appears standard, roughly 15 cm diameter, the pasta and mushrooms fill approximately 3/4 of the bowl volume. The sauce itself is mostly liquid with mushrooms included as part of the sauce's solid content. Considering density, the creamy sauce with mushrooms is moderately dense, but because it is spread thinly across the pasta, the sauce weight should be less than the pasta or vegetable portions. Estimating mushroom mass given 8-9 pieces averaging about 12-15g each suggests about 100-130g mushrooms. The cream and other sauce ingredients will add to this, but thin sauce layer implies about 20-30g of liquid cream and seasoning. Adding mushrooms and sauce liquid together, the combined weight of the sauce aux champignons is roughly 120-160g. Visually, the sauce coats all pasta and visible mushrooms steadily but thinly, which supports this moderate weight range. Therefore, considering all visual and density factors, I estimate the weight of 'sauce aux champignons (crème + ail + champignon)' in this image to be approximately 140 grams."

The image shows a white bowl containing one single spherical scoop of vanilla ice cream ('boule de glace vanille') covered partially by a dark brown liquid which is the hot chocolate sauce ('chocolat chaud'). The vanilla ice cream scoop is round and approximately 5-6 cm in diameter, based on the bowl size and the visible thickness of the ice cream. The ice cream appears dense and creamy, typical for vanilla ice cream. There is one discrete scoop only, and it is not mixed with the other component, the strawberry rhubarb compote, which is separate in the bowl. Considering a typical single scoop of ice cream weighs between 90 to 110 grams depending on density and size, and given the size observed here, I estimate the vanilla ice cream scoop to weigh around 95 grams."

In the image, the target food item 'kiwi' is cut into multiple pieces placed on top of a bowl containing séré maigre (a type of cottage cheese or quark). The pieces vary in size but generally appear to be slices roughly 2 to 3 cm long and about 1 to 1.5 cm thick. Counting the visible pieces, there are approximately 18 kiwi pieces scattered across the bowl. The pieces are piled slightly, so some volume is hidden underneath the top layer. The bowl diameter is about 15 cm (based on a typical small bowl size), confirming a moderate portion size. Kiwi flesh is dense and juicy, with average density close to 1 g/cm³. Visually, these pieces likely come from one medium-sized kiwi fruit, which typically weighs between 70 to 90 grams in total when peeled and sliced. Since there is no visible peeling or extra kiwi off the bowl, it is reasonable to estimate the visible kiwi corresponds to about 80 grams. There is no visible honey ('miel') on top, only on the other side of the bowl, so it is excluded. This estimation is based solely on visual volume and known typical fruit dimensions, prioritizing the actual image evidence and avoiding overestimation."

In the image, the target food item is the 'salade de tomates,' which consists of roughly sliced tomato pieces arranged on a medium-sized plate. I count approximately 14 visible tomato pieces that vary slightly in size. Each piece appears to be roughly 2-3 cm thick, with the slices showing visible juicy flesh and tomato skin, indicating typical density for fresh tomatoes. The pieces are layered with some overlap and sprinkled with flax seeds and fresh herbs on top, but these toppings contribute negligible weight to the tomatoes themselves. The tomatoes are spread across the plate without excessive piling, and the plate diameter compared to the nearby knife and fork suggests a standard 22-24 cm plate, helping estimate portion size. Considering density of fresh tomatoes around 0.9 g/cm3 and thickness/volume visible, each piece might weigh around 25-30 grams. Multiplying by 14 pieces yields roughly 350-420 grams. Taking a conservative and visually grounded estimate, the total tomato portion weight is approximately 380 grams."

Each indentation is roughly 2.5-3 cm wide. The waffle covers approximately 10 x 7.5 cm surface area, matching a small to medium portion size. The waffle's texture and color indicate it is cooked through but not overly dense. There is no visible topping or spreading directly on the waffle affecting its weight under the 'gaufre' label. Comparing the waffle size to the plate and the pattern spacing, this waffle likely weighs between 70-90 grams. I estimate 80 grams as a reasonable central value, considering the thickness and visible volume compared to typical portion sizes."

The image shows a white bowl containing milk and cereal clusters with small pieces of chocolate. The cereal pieces are irregular clusters, partly submerged in milk, and floating on the surface. The milk fills roughly half the depth of the bowl. The spoon above gives a visual size reference: the bowl diameter is about 15-17 cm. The clusters are about 2-4 cm wide each, and there are approximately 15-20 visible pieces. Given the density of dry cereal clusters (light but compact) and accounting for some being partially soaked, the total volume of cereal would be about 80-100 cm3 when dry. Dry cereals with similar density are typically around 0.3-0.4 g/cm3. Taking the midpoint density gives approximately 30-40 grams total. Considering possible slight undercounting of smaller hidden pieces, the realistic cereal weight estimate is around 35 grams."

The pieces appear dense and moist, as cooked beetroot usually is, with a typical density close to that of water or slightly higher. The total volume of beetroot cubes is estimated around 90-100 cm³. Considering density near water, 1 cm³ roughly equals 1 gram. Therefore, the total weight is approximately 90-100 grams. Being conservative and accounting for some possible overestimation in size, I estimate the weight of the betterave portion to be 95 grams."

The target food item is 'fromage', which is cheese. The image shows an open sandwich with two slices of pain bis (brown bread). On the right slice, there are thin slices of cheese placed side by side, partially overlapping. I count about 6 individual cheese slices of roughly rectangular shape, each approximately 7-8 cm long and 1-1.5 cm wide. The slices appear thin, approximately 1-2 mm thick, based on the edge profile visible beneath the cornichons. The cheese is pale yellow, semi-hard in appearance. The overlapping may hide slight thickness variation but overall the total cheese layer is relatively thin. Compared to the bread slice which is about 12-15 cm long, this confirms the cheese piece length estimate. Considering the density of semi-hard cheese (~1.1 g/cm3), and using estimated dimensions per slice (approx 7 cm x 1.3 cm x 0.15 cm = 1.37 cm3), multiplied by 6 slices, yields a volume around 8.2 cm3. Multiplying by density gives around 9 grams of cheese. Given visual uncertainties and slight overlap, I adjust to estimate the cheese portion weight as approximately 9 grams."

The image shows a bowl containing several food items: flat green beans (haricot coco), shrimps (crevettes), small round wheat pearls (perle de blé) mixed with a yellow saffron cream sauce, and the green beans lying on top and partly covering the other ingredients. Focusing on the perle de blé, these small wheat pearls appear as small, round grains, packed and mixed with the sauce and some small pieces of shrimp. The pearls fill roughly about 40-50% of the bottom half of the bowl, with a visible depth of about 3-4 cm estimated from the bowl and visible layering. Comparing the wheat pearl portion to the size of the shrimps (which are medium-sized), the volume looks like around 100-120 ml of cooked wheat pearls mixed with sauce. Cooked wheat pearls are dense and compact, with an approximate density close to 1 g/ml when mixed with the creamy sauce. Therefore, estimating volume times density leads to roughly 100-120 grams. Taking a conservative approach for density variations and partial visible amount, I estimate the weight of perle de blé in this bowl to be about 110 grams."

It covers roughly half to slightly more than half of the bowl's volume, layered on top of white rice. The bowl is medium-sized, judging by the fork and laptop keyboard in the background. The dahl portion fills an estimated 60% of the bowl volume, with a moderate depth of around 5-6 cm visible. The density of cooked dahl with vegetables is relatively high as it is thick and moist. Considering this and the depth plus volume, I estimate the dahl de lentille weighs about 230 to 280 grams. Taking a conservative mid-range value, the estimate is 255 grams."

The cup is about 7-8 cm tall and approximately 6-7 cm in diameter at the opening, which is typical for single-serving yogurt pots. The yogurt is partially consumed but still appears to be mostly full, and the container has some fig pieces or fig-based granules visible at the bottom. Because the product is a dense dairy yogurt with fig bits and no visible signs of reduced volume, the container looks filled close to its original volume. Yogurt pots like this typically range between 100 g and 150 g. Considering the size relative to the fork and typical serving sizes for such products, I estimate the yogurt content (excluding the container weight) to be approximately 125 grams."

The glass itself is a small tumbler likely holding about 100-120 ml in total. Considering the density of houmous, which is thick and dense, the weight roughly corresponds to the volume in grams. Estimating the houmous occupies around 50-60 ml out of the glass, this corresponds to approximately 50-60 grams. There is no visible spillage or extra container content besides the houmous itself. Therefore, the estimated weight for the houmous au basilic is about 55 grams, balancing the visual fill level and the expected density of this type of spread."

The image shows a stainless steel container with a serving of multiple foods. The target food item is 'porc' (pork). The pork piece is located in the bottom left corner of the container, partially covered with a white sauce (sauce blanche). The piece of pork appears to be a single, fairly thick slice roughly rectangular in shape, measuring approximately 8 cm in length, 6 cm in width, and about 1.5 cm in thickness judged by the visible volume and relative size compared to the aubergine slices and polenta portion beside it. The pork is cooked and looks dense, typical for meat density. The sauce sitting on top adds surface coverage but no volume to the pork itself; hence it's excluded from the weight. Given these dimensions and typical pork density (~1.03 g/cm3), the estimated volume is roughly 8 cm × 6 cm × 1.5 cm = 72 cm³, leading to a weight around 70 to 75 grams. Considering the visible size and compactness, I estimate the pork weight in this meal to be approximately 72 grams."

The image shows a clear glass jar containing shelled peanuts (cacahuètes). The jar is about half full of peanuts, visible through the transparent glass. The peanuts occupy roughly the lower third of the jar's total volume, and the jar height visible corresponds to a standard small jar, with a diameter around 6 cm and height of filled portion about 5 cm. Peanuts are dense and compact, so the volume they occupy translates to a substantial weight. Counting individual peanuts is difficult due to stacking, but approximately 30 to 35 peanuts appear visible when estimating from the overall fill level. A single shelled peanut weighs roughly 0.5 to 0.6 grams. Multiplying this average weight by the estimated count yields a range of about 15 to 21 grams. Given some hidden volume and conservative estimate, the total weight of peanuts in this jar is approximately 18 grams."

The target food item is ""tonic au gingembre,"" which is visible as a clear glass bottle labeled ""GINGER."" The bottle is standing upright on a table next to a glass and a smartphone, providing scale references. The bottle appears standard in size for a single serving beverage, approximately the size of a typical 200 to 250 ml bottle. Given that tonic or ginger drinks have a density close to water, the weight of the liquid inside corresponds closely to its volume in grams. The bottle appears unopened or mostly full as the liquid level reaches near the neck. There is little to no visible missing liquid volume. The glass and phone nearby provide scale; the bottle height is about 15-17 cm and diameter about 5 cm, consistent with a typical 200-250 ml beverage bottle. Considering the density near 1 g/ml, the tonic au gingembre weighs approximately between 200 and 250 grams. By careful estimate of bottle fill and size, I conclude it contains roughly 220 grams of tonic au gingembre, excluding container weight as required."

The target food item is ""haricots rouges"" (red kidney beans). In the image, the haricots rouges are located on the left side of the plate, distinct in dark red color and shiny appearance, suggesting they are cooked. I count approximately 30-35 individual beans visible, some overlapping. Considering density, cooked kidney beans are fairly dense and compact. Comparing with the pasta and vegetables, the beans occupy about one-quarter of the plate's surface area and have some volume due to layering. The plate diameter is likely around 25-27 cm, and the beans form a slightly piled portion with an estimated depth of about 1.5-2 cm. Estimating volume and density, the portion is consistent with roughly 100 to 120 grams of cooked kidney beans. To be conservative and based on the visible layering and bean size, I estimate the weight of the haricots rouges to be approximately 110 grams."

The target food item is 'bout de gruyère'. In the image, the gruyère cheese piece is centrally located on the plate and appears as a solid rectangular block. Visually, it is approximately 12 cm long, about 2 cm wide, and about 1.5 cm thick, judging by comparison to nearby objects such as the croissants and carrot sticks. The surface of the cheese is smooth with a uniform density. Gruyère is a dense cheese, so the volume approximates the weight closely. Given the estimated volume of about 12 cm × 2 cm × 1.5 cm = 36 cm³ and considering the density of gruyère cheese around 1.1 g/cm³, the weight estimate is roughly 36 × 1.1 = approximately 40 grams. This weight fits the size of a small cheese wedge like the one visible, which is a small but substantial piece on the plate."
2ahgvr,tartine avec crème de marrons et beurre,47.0,30,17.0,0.0904050690201403,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/2ahgvr/dish_media/fb2a197e-9ecd-4c2c-b686-2bc13e28ef1c,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. Step 1: Visual Identification - The image shows a single slice of toasted bread (tartine) on a white plate. The tartine has a spread of brown chestnut cream (crème de marrons) over it with some visible patches of butter beneath or mixed in. There is only one tartine visible with no layering or mixing with other food items. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The slice of bread appears to be a standard small to medium sized piece of sliced toasted bread, roughly about 10 cm in length and 5-6 cm in width based on typical plate size and the spacing of bread crumbs around. The thickness of the bread appears to be about 1 to 1.2 cm. The spread layer appears to be relatively thin but adequately covers most of the surface. The butter layer, visible as lighter patches, is modest and partially absorbed into the bread. Step 3: Density Considerations - The tartine base (toasted bread) is moderately dense, maybe around 250-280 g per 1000 cm3. Chestnut cream is slightly denser and heavier than bread alone, and butter is very dense but applied in small quantities. The volume of bread alone for this slice is roughly 10 cm * 6 cm * 1.1 cm = 66 cm3, estimating the bread weight about 18-20 g. The chestnut cream spread is approximately 1-2 mm thick, covering most of the surface, which roughly corresponds to about 6-10 g of chestnut cream. Butter is a thin layer with visible patches, estimated about 3-4 g. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Adding the bread, chestnut cream, and butter weights conservatively, we arrive at about 18 g (bread) + 8 g (crème de marrons) + 4 g (butter) = 30 g total weight for the tartine with toppings. Since the target food item is the entire 'tartine avec crème de marrons et beurre,' no container weight included, this figure reflects the complete portion shown. Step 5: Cross Validation - The size matches known small tartine portions, and the spread quantities are modest and consistent with typical serving amounts. Crumbs around confirm the tartine size is small, avoiding overestimation. Thus, a conservative and visual-based estimate for this tartine with chestnut cream and butter is 30 grams."

The target food item to estimate is 'pâtes'. Visually, the pasta is located in the lower left half of the plate and appears as tagliatelle or fettuccine style ribbons in a small pile underneath mushroom slices with sauce. Counting individual pieces of pasta is not applicable due to their intertwined nature. The visible area occupied by the pasta is roughly 9-10 cm in diameter on the plate. The pasta thickness and density are consistent with cooked wheat pasta, moderately thick in ribbon form. The portion is a single layer with some overlap, estimated depth about 1.5 cm considering some folding and piling. Reference to the plate size (typical dinner plate approx 25-27 cm diameter) supports this spatial estimate. Considering cooked pasta density (approximately 1.3 g/cm3) and the visible volume, the pasta portion volume approximates a cylinder of about 10 cm diameter and 1.5 cm thickness, roughly 120 cm3. This translates to approximately 150-160 grams given typical density and moisture content. No container weight applies. Considering some margin for visual coverage and sauce wetness, a conservative estimate is 155 grams for the pasta portion."

The avocado ('avocat') is located near the bottom center of the plate. It consists of one visible wedge-shaped piece, which appears fresh with the skin removed and some flesh exposed. The avocado wedge is about 7 cm long and has a moderate thickness of approximately 2.5 cm. Compared to other items on the plate—such as grilled chicken skewers and shredded carrots—the avocado seems to occupy a solid but moderate volume. Considering avocado's density, which is relatively high due to its creamy fat content, and the visible size, this piece likely weighs between 40 and 50 grams. Given the conservative assessment to avoid overestimation, I estimate the avocado wedge weighs approximately 45 grams."

The target food item is 'tomate.' In the image, the tomatoes are located on the left side of the container, appearing as two visible slices of fresh tomato. The slices are relatively thick and take up a moderate surface area compared to other ingredients in the meal prep box. The slices are roughly 5 cm in diameter and about 0.7 cm thick, based on comparison with adjacent foods like avocado slices and tofu cubes. The tomato slices appear juicy but firm, typical of fresh tomato density, which I consider moderately dense (around 0.9 g/cm³). Given the approximate dimensions (2 slices each roughly 5 cm x 5 cm x 0.7 cm) the volume is about 35 cm³ (2 slices x 18 cm³ each, accounting for small irregularities). Multiplying by density gives an estimated weight of about 31 grams. I accounted for slight overlapping and moisture content typical of tomatoes and adjusted slightly downward to a conservative estimate. Hence, the weight estimate for the visible tomato slices is 30 grams."

The target food is 'caviar d'aubergine,' which is the spread visible on the upper slice of pain aux graines (seeded bread) on the plate. Visually, this slice of bread is about 12 cm long and 7 cm wide based on typical plate size and comparison to the other slice of bread. The caviar d'aubergine covers approximately 80% of the bread slice's surface in a smooth layer about 0.3 cm thick, judging by spread texture and shadow depth. Given the bread slice is about 20 grams (typical weight for rustic seeded bread slice), the spread volume roughly corresponds to 12 cm × 7 cm × 0.3 cm = 25.2 cm³. Eggplant spreads have a density close to water (approximately 1 g/cm³) because they mainly contain cooked eggplants and oil. Thus, the estimated weight for the caviar d'aubergine is roughly 25 grams. To be conservative and account for slight irregularities in spread thickness and consistency, I estimate the weight of this portion at 24 grams."

The target food item is 'sauce'. The image shows a white round plate with mashed potatoes taking central space on the plate. On top of and around the mashed potatoes are pieces of beef ragout and several whole carrot segments. Surrounding the solid foods is a brown liquid sauce, which also covers part of the plate's visible surface. The sauce fills the plate area around and slightly under the solid elements but does not fill a separate container. The depth of the sauce layer on the plate varies but appears thin, averaging approximately 2-3 mm thickness given the shallow pool. The surface area covered by the sauce on the plate is roughly circular with a diameter close to 15 cm in the visible area around the food. Calculating the volume as area×depth: the sauce covers an estimated area of about 176 cm² (15 cm diameter circle gives π×(7.5 cm)²), multiplied by approx. 0.2-0.3 cm thickness, gives about 35-53 cm³ of sauce. Considering sauce density close to water (~1 g/cm³), this corresponds roughly to 35-53 grams. The sauce is not heavily gelatinous or oily, appearing mostly water-based with some thickening, so density near 1 g/cm³ is reasonable. Therefore, a conservative estimate for the sauce weight, based solely on visible evidence of coverage and thickness, is approximately 45 grams."

The image shows a blue translucent bowl holding a serving of crème caramel. The bowl is held in one hand above a leg, providing scale for size estimation. The crème caramel appears to fill roughly the bottom center of the bowl, forming a mound with an estimated diameter of about 7-8 cm and a thickness of around 2 cm, based on the visible surface texture and volume. The bowl's curvature and the hand size suggest the volume of dessert is moderate, not overly shallow or deep. Crème caramel is a dense custard with a creamy, gelatinous texture. Given this density, a 7-8 cm diameter and 2 cm thick portion would weigh approximately 90-110 grams. To be conservative and grounded in visual evidence, I estimate the crème caramel portion weight at about 100 grams."

The target food item is 'crème de marrons,' which is visible as a brown spread on a torn piece of bread. The image shows two main portions of the spread: one larger spread area covering about half of the bread slice top surface, and a smaller separate clump on the left side. The spread has a glossy, dense appearance suggesting a thicker, sticky texture. The bread is the reference; the bread piece is roughly 10 cm long and about 4-5 cm wide. The spread thickness visually appears thin, approximately 2-3 mm average, though somewhat uneven. Taking into account the surface area covered (roughly 40-45 cm²) and thickness, the total volume of spread is estimated. Given chestnut cream density is moderately dense at around 1.3 g/cm³, the calculated volume yields an estimated weight around 25 to 30 grams. Considering some unevenness and minor additional spread in small clumps, a conservative estimate is 27 grams."

The image shows a white plate with three distinct food items: a portion of mozzarella on the upper left, a cluster of green olives below the mozzarella, and a mixed green salad on the right side of the plate. Focusing only on the mozzarella, it appears as a single, relatively thick, smooth, rounded and moist piece approximately 8-9 cm in diameter and about 2 cm in thickness. The mozzarella is resting directly on the plate with visible whey/juice around it. Comparing to the plate diameter (roughly 27 cm) and the visible olives nearby (average olive width around 2-3 cm), the mozzarella piece is moderately sized and dense, as typical for fresh mozzarella cheese. Swiss portion context suggests a ball of fresh mozzarella typically weighs 100-125 grams for a whole 100 g ball, but the piece here seems a bit smaller than a full ball, maybe about 80% of a standard ball. Based on visual volume and density considerations, I estimate the mozzarella weight to be approximately 85 grams."

The texture is smooth and dense, consistent with regular mayonnaise which is thick and heavy. Comparing the mayonnaise portion size to the other items on the plate and the fork nearby, the volume seems to be moderate, neither flat nor excessively heaped. Given the density of mayonnaise (roughly 0.9 g/ml) and the visual volume estimate of about 15 ml, the weight is approximately 13 to 15 grams. Considering a conservative estimation based on visible evidence and avoiding overestimation, I estimate the weight of the mayonnaise at about 14 grams."

The diameter appears consistent with a typical banana, about 3-4 cm thick. The banana is curved and has a moist, solid appearance. Considering the typical weight of a whole medium banana (around 120-150 grams including skin), and removing the skin reduces weight by roughly 12-15%. Given this is approximately half a banana with the peel removed, and based on visible thickness and length, the estimated weight should be about 60-70 grams. I select the middle of this range, conservatively estimating 65 grams for this peeled half banana."

The target food item is 'pain' which is a slice of bread with Nutella spread on it. Visually, the bread slice is on a standard-sized small dessert plate, allowing scale comparison. The bread slice is roughly oval and appears to cover about 60% of the plate's diameter, which suggests dimensions around 12 cm in length and 8 cm in width. The thickness of the bread slice looks typical of a moderately thick cut, estimated visually at around 1.5 cm. The bread is a whole grain or mixed-seed type, moderately dense but still porous. Considering its volume (approximately 12 cm x 8 cm x 1.5 cm = 144 cm3) and the known density of such bread (~0.25 to 0.3 g/cm3 due to porous texture), the weight is likely around 35 to 43 grams. Because this is one slice without visible crust thickness variation and no parts hidden, I conservatively estimate the weight at approximately 40 grams. Nutella spread weight is excluded as per instructions. Therefore, the estimated weight of the 'pain' slice alone, based purely on visible size and density, is about 40 grams."

The target food item is 'yogourt orange sanguine,' which is mixed with a cereal and blueberry blend in a bowl. Visually, the yogurt is not distinctly separate but fully mixed into the cereals and blueberries, forming a creamy layer enveloping the other ingredients. The serving bowl is medium-sized (~15 cm diameter judged by the teaspoon inside and relative to the glasses and cup on the table). The yogurt layer appears to fill roughly half to two-thirds of the volume of the bowl's contents, accounting for the liquid mixed in with the solid cereals and fruit. Estimating the total volume of the mixture as approximately 300 grams (typical for such a portion size in a bowl this size), and judging that the yogurt component makes up about 60% of this mixture by volume and density, I estimate the yogurt orange sanguine content weighs around 180 grams. The yogurt's consistency appears standard, dense enough to significantly contribute to the total weight but softened by mixing. Therefore, visual evidence supports an estimate around 180 grams for the specified yogurt in this combined dish."

They are medium-sized relative to the raspberries and the porridge grains visible nearby. Each blueberry is roughly spherical and about 1.5-2 cm in diameter. Comparing their size to the hand holding the bowl, they seem typical in size and volume without deformation or being cut. The blueberries are not densely packed, with some space between them, indicating the count is accurate with minimal hidden berries underneath. Considering the density of blueberries (about 0.9 g/cm³), and average weight per blueberry is approximately 1.2 to 1.5 grams depending on size. Using a conservative average of 1.3 grams per berry and counting 11 berries, the total estimated weight is approximately 14 grams. This estimation is visually grounded and considers the actual size and count within the image, avoiding assumptions beyond visible evidence."

The depth appears consistent with a typical pear, judging from the curvature visible, approximately 5-6 cm in thickness. Pears have moderate density with some water content, so a pear of this size generally weighs around 170 to 220 grams. Considering the specific shape and visible firmness with no visible shrinkage or major dents, I estimate the weight to be approximately 190 grams based on the visual evidence and scale to the hand size shown."

The target food item is 'polenta'. Looking at the image, the polenta is located on the right side of the container. It consists of a mound of solid pale yellow polenta, topped with a generous amount of shredded cheese. The polenta portion appears compact and dense, roughly occupying a rectangular area about half the length of the container and about 3/4 of the container's width. The depth cannot be measured directly but is likely similar to the visible thickness of the mound, approximately 3-4 cm, judging by the container edges and other food items. The shredded cheese on top adds some volume but is lightweight compared to the polenta base. Comparing the polenta mass to the pork slice and eggplants nearby, it clearly is the largest item in the dish. Polenta is dense but soft, so volume-to-weight conversion should consider density similar to cooked cornmeal, roughly 1.1 g/cm3. Based on the visible volume—roughly length 9 cm × width 6 cm × height 3.5 cm—this gives a volume of about 189 cm3. Multiplying by density 1.1 g/cm3 yields approximately 208 grams. Considering some compressibility and that the cheese adds minimal weight, a conservative estimate is 200 grams for the polenta portion shown in the image."

The target food item is 'graines de courge' (pumpkin seeds). Visually, the pumpkin seeds are scattered sparsely throughout the couscous mixture inside a rectangular, transparent glass container. The container is approximately 15 cm wide as judged by the hand holding it, and filled nearly to the top with couscous, tuna, cucumber pieces, and seeds. The pumpkin seeds are relatively small, dark green, and flat, with no large clusters visible. From the visible surface area, I estimate about 30-40 individual seeds are visible dispersed through the top layer. The seeds appear thin and flat, roughly 1-2 grams per tablespoon (which contains approximately 15-20 seeds). Considering the seeds are mixed in multiple layers within the couscous, there is likely about 2 to 3 tablespoons worth of seeds in total, factoring in some hidden seeds throughout the mixture. Pumpkin seeds are dense and somewhat heavy for their volume. Given the visible distribution and depth of the dish, I estimate the pumpkin seeds' total weight to be in the range of 5 to 7 grams. Being conservative and prioritizing visual evidence, I estimate the 'graines de courge' weight at 6 grams."

The target food item is 'cottage cheese aux herbes,' located near the bottom center of the plate. This portion is a small pile of white cottage cheese with visible herb flecks, appearing moist and granular. Visually, it occupies roughly a small spoonful sized area on the plate, approximately 4-5 cm wide and 1.5-2 cm thick. Compared to the fried egg on the right and the other items on the plate, the volume is modest but significant. Cottage cheese has a density roughly similar to soft cheese or curds, which is around 1 gram per cubic centimeter. Estimating a volume close to 25-30 cubic centimeters from the visible portion suggests the weight is in the range of 25-30 grams. Considering this is a small but solid portion, I conservatively estimate 28 grams for the cottage cheese aux herbes, as the portion is not heaped but a smooth dollop."

The image shows a single chocolate chip cookie placed on a granite surface. Visually, the cookie is irregularly round with a diameter roughly estimated around 7 to 8 cm based on common cookie size perception compared to the visible stone texture grain sizes. The cookie appears moderately thick, with a rough surface and visible chocolate chunks distributed unevenly. The thickness can be estimated as approximately 1.5 cm based on the rough texture and chunk depth visible. The cookie texture looks dense but not overly compact, typical of a soft-baked chocolate chip cookie. Given the dense chocolate chunks and typical cookie dough density, an average cookie of this size and thickness weighs about 50 to 60 grams. Based on the visual evidence, including surface texture and chunk distribution, a conservative estimate would be approximately 55 grams for this cookie."

The image shows a single round slice (rondelle) of lemon floating on top of a clear glass of water. The glass is a typical small drinking glass with a diameter of approximately 7 cm visible from the top. The lemon slice fits comfortably inside the diameter of the glass and appears to be around 6-7 mm thick based on visible side depth and typical lemon slice thickness. The lemon peel appears about 3 mm thick, with the lemon flesh taking the rest of the thickness. The lemon slice is uniform and fully visible with no parts missing. Considering the density of lemon, which is mostly water with a bit of pulp and peel making it denser than water but lighter than many fruits, a thin slice weighing between 8 and 12 grams is reasonable. Given visual cues, I estimate the lemon slice to weigh approximately 9 grams."

The target food item is 'sauce oignons,' which is the onion sauce visible on top of the slices of rôti (roast meat) on the plate. Step 1: Visual identification shows the sauce oignons consists of thinly sliced onions cooked down into a dark reddish-brown sauce generously layered over the roast slices. It is not spread across the plate but localized on the meat area. Step 2: Dimension analysis shows the total sauce coverage is on approximately three slices of meat with onion strips spread evenly but thinly, covering maybe 50-60% of the roast's visible surface. The volume appears shallow, mainly a thin layer of cooked onions and sauce, roughly estimated as a layer about 0.3 cm thick over an approximate surface of roast meat of about 10 cm by 7 cm (70 cm²). This yields a volume estimate of roughly 21 cm³. Considering the density of cooked onion sauce is close to that of water or slightly higher (~1.0-1.1 g/cm³), the estimated weight would be near 21-23 grams. Step 3: Density considerations confirm that cooked onions with sauce tend to have water content and moderate density, supporting this weight approximation. Step 4: Using the Swiss portion context as a guideline but prioritizing visual evidence, the onion sauce portion appears moderate, not heaped or overly thick. Step 5: Cross-validation to avoid overestimation confirms a conservative estimate of roughly 22 grams is reasonable. Therefore, factoring in the actual visible quantity and density, the weight of the sauce oignons is estimated at 22 grams."

The target food item is 'oeuf' which is located on the lower-left part of the plate. The oeuf appears to be scrambled egg, with a somewhat loose, slightly fluffy texture. The portion covers a small area on the plate, approximately 6 cm by 4 cm, with a visible thickness of about 1 cm. The egg is broken into small curds but largely forms one contiguous portion. Compared to the tortilla wrap on the same plate, the volume is notably smaller. Considering the dense nature of cooked eggs and the visible volume, this portion looks like roughly a scrambled egg from about half to two-thirds of a large egg. A large cooked egg typically weighs about 50 grams. Given the partial quantity visible and its spread on the plate, my estimation is approximately 30 grams for this portion of scrambled eggs."

The image shows a plate with a mixed dish containing rice, cherry tomatoes, peach, corn, asparagus, tuna, red kidney beans, and a portion of boiled egg. The target food item is 'oeuf' (egg). Visually, there is one half of a boiled egg on the plate. The egg half includes the white and a slightly soft yolk center. Considering the size of the half relative to the rice grains and cherry tomatoes, the egg appears to be a medium-sized chicken egg. A full medium boiled egg typically weighs around 50 grams, including shell, but with the shell removed, the edible part weighs about 45 grams. This portion is approximately half of the egg, so the visible weight should be about half of 45 grams, which equals about 22-23 grams. The estimation must exclude shell weight and any garnish. Given the precise visual evidence of one half egg on the plate with no visible missing parts, the estimated weight of the egg portion on the plate is around 22 grams."

The container is comparable in size to the apple next to it. The typical small yogurt pot like this generally holds around 125 grams of content based on its dimensions and the visible fill level, which appears almost full. The yogurt appears smooth and standard density for plain yogurt. Therefore, based on visual assessment and typical container size, the estimated weight of the yaourt nature is approximately 125 grams."

The target food item is ""graines de chia"" (chia seeds) in a bowl with other mixed ingredients. Visually, the chia seeds are dispersed throughout the white creamy mixture of blanc battu, oats, and honey, and do not appear as a separate piled or layered entity, but are mixed in. This makes direct visual estimation challenging, so I estimate by considering their visible density and spread. The bowl is a standard medium-sized bowl roughly 12-14 cm in diameter. The mixture fills about half to two thirds of the bowl. The visible chia seeds are sparse and small, appearing as tiny black dots throughout the mixture. The total visible quantity of chia seeds corresponds to approximately 10-15% of the total mixture volume. Given the density of dry chia seeds is about 0.7 g per teaspoon (around 5 grams per tablespoon), and typical serving sizes of chia seeds range from 15 to 30 grams in mixtures like this, the visual amount corresponds more to the lower range due to their relatively sparse surface presence compared to the rest. Considering the chia seeds are hydrated and mixed, their dense dry weight is concentrated but dispersed. Thus, estimating conservatively and visually, the chia seeds weigh about 15 grams in this serving."

The target food item is 'sauce curry avec mayonnaise' found inside two sandwich halves on a plate. Visually, the sauce is spread in a thin layer inside the baguette-type bread under the chicken and lettuce. It occupies the length of the bread, roughly 15-18 cm based on standard baguette size, but the thickness of the sauce layer is thin and unevenly spread, approximately 1-2 mm thick in most places. The sauce is dense but spread thinly, so volume is limited. Comparing it to the size of the bread and chicken piece, the total volume of sauce is relatively small, roughly 20-30 ml in total when combining both sandwich halves. Considering typical sauce density near that of mayonnaise (about 0.9-1 g/ml), the weight estimate for the sauce curry with mayonnaise combined is approximately 20-30 grams. Being conservative due to thin spread and partial visibility, I would estimate it around 25 grams total for these two sandwich halves combined."

The image shows a piece of pain complet (whole grain bread) topped with a layer of white yogourt nature (plain yogurt) and an orange-brown confiture mirabelle (mirabelle plum jam) spread on top of the yogurt. The yogurt and jam are together on the bread, which appears to be a standard slice of about 12 cm by 7 cm. The yogurt layer spreads evenly and thickly over the bread slice, with a visible depth estimation of about 0.5 cm given the slight raised edge and spread consistency typical of spooned yogurt. The jam layer is thinner and occupies about half the surface area of the yogurt layer, with an estimated thickness of about 0.2 cm. Based on these visual cues, the volume of yogurt is approximately 12 cm x 7 cm x 0.5 cm = 42 cubic cm. Considering yogurt has a density close to water at about 1 g/cm³, the yogurt's estimated weight is around 42 grams. The jam's volume is roughly half the bread surface (12 x 7 / 2 = 42 cm²) times 0.2 cm thick, about 8.4 cubic cm, so about 8.4 grams, but as the jam is not the target food item, it is excluded. Given the visual evidence, I estimate the weight of the yogourt nature on this slice to be approximately 42 grams."

The image shows an open sandwich made with two slices of 'pain bis' (brown bread). The left slice has a visible layer of mayonnaise spread across its surface. The mayonnaise appears to be spread thinly but covering almost the entire slice. The slice is roughly the size of an adult hand, around 12 cm in length and 7 cm in width. Mayonnaise spread is typically around 2-3 mm thick when applied as in the image. Given the surface area approximately 84 sq cm (12 cm x 7 cm) and thickness around 2.5 mm (0.25 cm), the volume of mayonnaise is about 21 cm³. Mayonnaise density is close to that of water but slightly higher due to oil content, approximately 0.95 g/cm³. Multiplying volume by density yields roughly 20 grams. There is no visible excess or clumping, so the estimation reflects a conservative, realistic portion for a sandwich spread. Therefore, the mayonnaise portion weighs approximately 20 grams."

Step 1: Visual Identification - The image shows one croissant au chocolat held in a hand on a bakery paper. The croissant is partially bitten at one end, revealing flaky pastry layers and some chocolate filling inside. No other croissants or food items are visible. Step 2: Dimension Analysis - The croissant is held by one hand which gives a scale reference. A typical adult hand width is roughly 7.5-9 cm. The croissant length appears slightly shorter than the width of the hand, so approximately 10-11 cm long. Width across the middle is about 5-6 cm, and the thickness from visible side is about 3-4 cm judging by the layers and puffiness. Step 3: Density Considerations - Croissants are baked puff pastries with some air inside and chocolate filling which adds density. The croissant has a moderately fluffy appearance but with a decent amount of chocolate inside which is denser than pastry alone. Step 4: Portion Size Calibration - Typical croissant au chocolat in bakery weighs between 70 to 100 grams. Given this is an average-sized croissant partially eaten, about 1-2 bites missing, I estimate around 80% of original croissant remains. Step 5: Cross-validation - The visible volume and density match a weight close to 70-80 grams. Being conservative and based fully on visual evidence, I estimate the croissant au chocolat weight to be 75 grams."

The bowl appears to be about 10 cm in diameter and roughly 4-5 cm in height as a reference from standard small glass bowls. The yogurt fills approximately three-quarters of the bowl's height, which visually corresponds to a volume roughly between 150-180 ml. Considering the density of chocolate yogurt is close to that of regular yogurt, about 1g/ml, this volume estimate translates almost directly to weight in grams. There is no visible evidence of any other content or dilution that would change the density noticeably. The container's weight is excluded as per instruction. Based on this assessment, the weight of the chocolate yogurt in the bowl is estimated at approximately 170 grams, balancing the visible volume and density."

The target food item to estimate is 'purée cacahuète' (peanut butter). Visually, it appears as a small dollop on the black plate, separate from the other foods (oatmeal, chocolate chips, and half a banana). The dollop is relatively thick and creamy, sitting on the surface of the plate with some slight spread. Comparing its size to the half banana slice nearby (which is roughly 7-8 cm long), the peanut butter portion measures approximately 4 cm in length and 2 cm in width, with an estimated thickness of about 0.5 cm based on the visible height and typical cream consistency. The volume is therefore roughly 4 cm x 2 cm x 0.5 cm = 4 cubic centimeters. Peanut butter has a density close to 1.1 g/cm³, so the weight is approximately 4.4 grams. Given minor variations in spread and thickness, I estimate the weight to be around 4 to 6 grams, with 5 grams as a reasonable central estimate. Therefore, the weight of the peanut butter portion is about 5 grams."

The item appears to be a small puff pastry swirl or roll with visible layers of pastry dough and a tomato sauce filling on one side. There is light charring on the edges of the tomato sauce, suggesting a baked texture. The pastry is roughly cylindrical but slightly flattened, with multiple visible layers indicating puff pastry. Based on visual comparison to the wood grain and the apparent thickness, the item appears approximately 4 cm long, 3 cm wide, and about 2.5 cm thick. Puff pastry is relatively dense due to layers of butter and dough, and tomato sauce adds some moisture but not significant weight. Considering the size and density of puff pastry, a single piece of this size would weigh roughly between 20 to 30 grams.

Comparing to the plate size and the other portions, this appears to be a moderately dense salad with a light dressing, typical of celery root salads. Given that shredded celery root salads have moderate density due to fibrous content and dressing, I estimate the density to be about 0.7 g/cm³. Multiplying estimated volume (6x4x2.5 = 60 cm³) by density (0.7 g/cm³) gives approximately 42 grams. Considering some compression and dressing, I adjust slightly upwards to about 45 grams.

There is no visible container or packaging, and the chocolates have some thickness with rounded edges, indicating they are not hollow. Each chocolate bunny is approximately 4-5 cm tall and about 2-3 cm wide at its base. Given the density of chocolate and the visible volume, each figure likely weighs between 20 to 25 grams. Since the target food item is 'chocolat' in general, and the image shows two such chocolate rabbits, I will estimate the weight of one chocolate rabbit only as requested. Thus, the estimated weight for one chocolate rabbit is about 23 grams, balancing the size and density visually perceived."

The target food item is ""vinaigre"". In the image, vinaigre is visible as a dressing lightly spread over the salad ingredients. It appears as a thin coating with visible mustard seeds on top of chopped cucumber, tomato, and shredded carrot. There is no visible pool or thick layer of liquid; the vinaigre is dispersed sparingly across the surface and mixed into the salad. The volume of liquid vinegar is small, likely just a few tablespoons. Given the size of the bowl (medium-sized, approximately 20cm diameter) and the light coverage, the vinaigre is estimated as roughly 15-20ml, corresponding to about 15-20 grams since vinegar density is near water. I estimate the total vinaigre to weigh approximately 18 grams, accounting for some minor absorption and distribution within the salad. This is a conservative estimate based solely on visible evidence without overestimation."

The image shows a single cookie placed on a wooden surface. The cookie is roughly circular but irregular in shape and includes visible large chunks of dark chocolate embedded within the dough. Comparing the cookie size to typical wood grain widths and the table surface texture, the diameter of the cookie is approximately 8 cm. The thickness is not directly visible but judging from the shadow and texture, it appears moderately thick, around 1.5 cm. The cookie dough looks dense with chocolate chunks adding to overall weight density. A cookie of this size and density generally weighs between 45 and 60 grams. Given the visible size and density, I estimate the cookie’s weight at about 55 grams, considering it is neither too thin nor unusually light."
ppf8hc,boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate,316.0,315,1.0,0.03575469563249604,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/ppf8hc/dish_media/bf22a1b3-a8b6-4823-a44b-0893c3097763,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'boulettes au légumes à la sauce tomate.' From the image, I see a total of 9 vegetable meatballs distributed around and on top of pasta, all covered partially with tomato sauce. Each meatball appears roughly spherical and about 3-4 cm in diameter. The meatballs have a dense, compact appearance typical of vegetable-based balls with coating sauce, which suggests moderate density, less dense than meat but denser than vegetables alone. Given the size, an individual vegetable meatball of this size likely weighs around 35 grams. Multiplying by 9 visible meatballs results in an estimated total weight around 315 grams. There is no obvious stacking or hidden layers of meatballs beneath the visible ones, so no upward adjustment for hidden quantity. The meatballs cover a good part of the pasta but do not seem overly large or small relative to the plate and pasta. Therefore, a conservative estimate based on visible evidence is approximately 315 grams for the vegetable meatballs with tomato sauce."
wrah5h,avocat,39.0,40,1.0,0.004412763068567549,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/19a2e7b0-7aad-44c5-b52a-d67294d4ef49,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The avocado ('avocat') is visible on the top right side of the galette wrap, consisting of two slices that seem to be about 6-7 cm long, 2-3 cm wide, and roughly 1 cm thick based on comparison to the fork on the right and the wrap diameter (~22 cm). The flesh appears dense but soft, with some surface indentation. The slices are not too thick but solid pieces. A typical avocado weighs around 150-200 grams whole; these two slices appear to be about one quarter of an average avocado. Considering density and the visual volume, these two slices likely weigh around 40 grams total. This visual estimate aligns with portion size on the plate without overestimating the avocado weight."
p96w4a,vinaigre balsamique,13.0,12,1.0,0.0014709210228558498,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/p96w4a/dish_media/7004d086-abf6-4e9f-a945-0d22f3a60a84,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The target food item is 'vinaigre balsamique'. In the image, the vinaigre balsamique is visibly drizzled on top of a vegetable salad inside a small white bowl. The amount of vinaigre balsamique is the dark brown liquid visible mainly on the top and drizzled unevenly over the salad components. The vinaigre balsamique covers parts of the salad, but does not pool in large quantities at the bottom, indicating a relatively small volume. Comparing the vinaigre balsamique to the white bowl, which appears to be about 10 cm in diameter and 5-6 cm deep, the visible vinaigre balsamique is a thin coating and some small pools, which I estimate to be roughly 1 to 1.5 tablespoons in total. Given that 1 tablespoon of vinegar has a density around 1 g/ml, this corresponds to approximately 15 ml or 15 grams maximum. Considering a slightly conservative approach due to some liquid spreading and partial absorption or mixing with the vegetables, I estimate the vinaigre balsamique weight to be about 12 grams based on visual volume and distribution."

The target food item is 'oeuf au plat' (fried egg). Visually, the fried egg is on the bottom left of the plate. It is whole, with the white spread over an approximate area of about 10 cm by 8 cm, and a yolk roughly 3.5-4 cm in diameter, slightly raised. The egg white thickness seems thin, about 2-3 mm on average, while the yolk is thicker, approximately 5-6 mm. The egg appears freshly cooked with no visible breakage or missing parts. Comparing the egg size to the cherry tomatoes next to it, which are about 2-3 cm in length, confirms a typical large egg from visual scale. Fried egg density is close to raw egg density, around 1.03 g/cm3. Typical large eggs weigh around 50-60g raw, with cooked weight slightly less due to moisture loss, but here the entire cooked egg is present. Therefore, based on the size comparison, shape, visible depth, and typical density, this fried egg weighs approximately 50 grams."
wrah5h,galette wraps,65.0,65,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/wrah5h/dish_media/19a2e7b0-7aad-44c5-b52a-d67294d4ef49,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows one galette wrap placed flat on a plate with visible toppings. The wrap itself is whole and unobstructed. Comparing the wrap diameter to the fork on the right side, the wrap appears to be around 20-22 cm in diameter, matching a typical galette wrap size. The wrap is thin and flat with some flexibility, typical for galette wraps. Since the wrap is not folded or layered, the weight corresponds to a single flat thin wrap. Typical whole wheat or buckwheat galette wraps of this size weigh approximately 60-70 grams. Visual evidence confirms it is not thicker or folded, thus not heavier than the usual portion. Therefore, estimating conservatively based on visible size and density of this galette wrap, the weight is approximately 65 grams."
xjvrtk,boulgour,170.0,170,0.0,0.0,https://www.myfoodrepo.org/api/v1/subjects/xjvrtk/dish_media/d8aaea52-09df-4596-892c-0d03f5b6b9cd,"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer. The image shows a rectangular glass container with three separate foods: bulgur, ratatouille, and a hard-boiled egg sliced in half. The target food is bulgur. The bulgur occupies roughly one-third of the container's base area with a relatively even layer about 2-3 cm deep. Comparing the bulgur portion size to the two egg halves diagonally adjacent (each half about 4-5 cm long), the bulgur's dimensions are approximately 10 cm by 8 cm by 2.5 cm thick, giving a volume around 200 cubic centimeters. Cooked bulgur has a density close to 0.9 g/cm3 due to moisture content. Multiplying volume by density gives roughly 180 grams. Given some visible fluffiness and minor empty spaces between grains, a slight downward adjustment to about 170 grams is reasonable. Therefore, the estimated weight of the bulgur portion in the image is approximately 170 grams."
