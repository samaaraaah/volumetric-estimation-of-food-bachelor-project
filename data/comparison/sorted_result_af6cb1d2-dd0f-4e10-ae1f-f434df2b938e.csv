The specified food item is 'huile de lin' (flaxseed oil). In the image, there is no visible pool or drizzle of oil that can be directly observed. However, it is possible that the oil has been mixed into the other components, such as the courgette or purée. Since the oil is not visually identifiable, it is impossible to estimate its weight based on the image alone. Therefore, I must conclude that the weight of 'huile de lin' cannot be determined from this image."

One slice has a light yellow spread (butter) combined with a darker syrup-like substance (likely molasses), and the other slice has a chocolate spread (Nutella). The butter is visible on both slices, but it is spread thinly. Based on the size of the bread slices and the thin application of butter, I estimate that the total amount of butter used is approximately 10 grams. This accounts for the visible spread on both slices."

The image shows a piece of bread (pain) with a visible spread of crème de marrons (chestnut cream). The spread is applied thinly but covers most of the surface of the bread. Based on the visual thickness and the area covered, the amount of crème de marrons appears to be approximately 15-20 grams. This estimation considers the density of chestnut cream, which is relatively high, and the visible spread. I will estimate the weight as 18 grams."

The image shows a small piece of a croissant with visible layers, butter, and apricot jam on top. The food list specifies 'demi croissant,' which means half a croissant. A standard croissant typically weighs around 50-60 grams. Since this is a half croissant, its weight would be approximately 25-30 grams. However, the piece shown is smaller than half, likely about one-third of a croissant. Adjusting for this, the weight of the visible portion is estimated to be around 15-20 grams. Considering the density and size, I estimate the weight to be 18 grams."

The specified food item is 'graines de chia' (chia seeds). In the image, the chia seeds are mixed into a bowl of blanc battu (a type of yogurt), along with other ingredients like oats and honey. Chia seeds are visible as small black dots distributed throughout the mixture. Based on the size of the bowl and the typical amount of chia seeds used in such a preparation (usually a small quantity due to their high absorbency and density), I estimate that approximately 10-15 grams of chia seeds are present. This estimation is grounded in the visible distribution of the seeds and the typical serving size for this type of dish."
